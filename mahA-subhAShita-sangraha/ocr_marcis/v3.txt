Of the M aha-subha~ita-samgraha, the extensive collection
of wise sayings and entertaining verses in Sanskrit, intended
to be issued in twenty volumes, Volume Ill, which is now
being placed before scholars, contains over two thousand
verses, Nos. 4209-6285, ·beginning with the Devan-agari letters
an, ~ and f. In the compilation of this volume, in addition
to the source materials used in the previous volumes, rele-
vant materials extracted from certain extra sources have also
been utilized. While the printing of the present volume was
in progress, I was engaged also in preparing a two-volume
Descriptive Catalogue ot Authors Quoted in Sanskrit Anthologies
and Inscriptions, to be published shortly by Ms. Otto Harrassowitz,
Wiesbaden (W. Germany). Studies in this regard had enabled
me to revise and expand substantially, the ''Index of Authors
and Sources of Individual Verses" included in the present
volume (pp. 1493-1558). Readers of Vols. I and II of the
M aha-subhll~ita-sarhgraha are, therefore, requested to consult also,
with advantage, the relevant Index in the present volume for
additional information.
In the present volume, special attention had been paid_
to the presentation of the materials included, viz., the original
verses, their translation, varia lexica and the Indices, in which
I received active collaboration from Sn S. Bhaskaran Nair,
Director of the V. V. Research Institute. It was he who
checked the textual verses and fixed the readings in a number
of doubtful verses, suggesting suitable emendations and revis-
ing the Critical Notes accordingly with the addition of necessary
explanations in the Footnotes ; touched up inelegant translations
besides himself translating a large nmnber of verses ; and
verified and revised, as necessary, the different Appendices to
this volume. It is my pleasant duty to record my infinite
gratitude and sincerest appreciation for the strenuous editorialVIII
PREFAC~
work which Sri Nair has performed in a most scholarly manner
towards making this volume more perfect and handy to the
cultured reader. The credit of seeing this publication through
the press and seeing to its elegant get-up also goes to him.
In short, the present work of mine has been immensely benefited
by the vast experienoe which Sri Nair possesses in editing
Indological research works.
My thanks are due, in full measure, also to Sri K. V. Sarma,
Acting Director, the V. V. B. Institute of Sanskrit and
Indological Studies, Panjab University, for making available to
the Editor his expert advice, time and again, towards the
scholarly presentation of the volume.

Oh the pity of it ! The excellent
pearls were sold away along with jujuba-
fruits as they were associated together by
people totally devoid of the sense of dis-
crimination, on the borders of a worthless
hamlet in the country.
These entered
into the dull mouths of worthless country-
fools and were thrown away with a gurgl-
ing sound. Do unmeritorious people know
the superior merits of good things ? Hence
weeps the pearl. (A. A. R.).

The mrmtra consisting of the name of
the Lord Kr~1Ja is ever fruitful, when
merely uttered by the tongue: it requires
not the performance of any dilllc.:ult vow
nor payment of fees to priests; there is not
the slightest trouble of worship; it attracts
the minds of the fortunate people, destroys
sins, however great, and is within the easy
reach of all, from the lowest in the scale
to all those who are not dumb; and it
brings
the
happiness of liberation.

May the handful of flowers offered by
the goddess Lak~mi to Lord Vi$l)U
protect you all ! Lak$mi who laughed when
told that he was Brahma [the creator-
grandfather], in the svayamvara-ceremony;
got frightened near Lord Siva, turned
away from Brhaspati, the preceptor of the
gods, disclosed timidity near the fire-god,
was full of intolerance when introduced
to Indra, the husband of Paulomi, and
who became bashful when she reached the
best of puru~a-s [Vi~ryu]. (A. A. R.).

The lover (remaining at a distance)
smelt the lotus-flower and the charming-
eyed damsel, smiling brought her face
nearer (to the hand) ; the lover inflicted
nail-marks on the sporting ball in his hand
and she, making a hissing noise of
pleasurable pain concealed her bosom; he
placed the garland of campaka-fiowers
round his neck and she experienced a
thrill of pleasure in her limbs and remained
with eyes closed; thus, though the loving
pair were at a distance, their enjoyment of
happiness was full. (A. A. R.). Oh ! ruby, do not be distressed that a
monkey holding you first smelt, then licked
all-round, pressed hard with his nails,
tried to chew it in the mouth and .finally
threw you away in disgust as he could not
find any juice in you. You must indeed
be thankful, that the monkey, in his
curiosity to find out what is inside, did
not powder you with a stone. (A. A. R. ).

poor by the will of fate; thus, these which

The soul and the mind are styled to
be the ''internal senses'' by those who are
conversant with the workings of these
two. By a conjoint effort of these two,
volition is engendered.
(k)
The soul, the mind, the sense-organs,
and the sense-objects, all these are said
to be included under the category of
"external sense". Volition and muscular
movement are the means of pleasurable
sensations of the soul.
The (connecting) medium between the
'internal and the external sense" seems to
be a conscious effort.
Therefore, sup-
pressing this conscious effort one may try
to become the master of his own mind.

Having drunk the intoxicating wine of
delusion, the people [world] have got quite
mad and senseless ; for, they do not sec
that their life is gradually shortened with
the daily rising and setting of the sun; for,
they cannot know that time is rapidly
passing away, on account of their being
seriously engaged with a variety of affairs;
and, for, they are not frightened even at
the sight of birth, old age, misfortunes and
death of others. (P. G. Natb's translation). Have the suns (of doomsday) in-
vaded the sky in all the ten directions
causing the fear of the destruction of the
world ? Or have masses of flames come
into being for burning the worlds ? Thus
were the gods frightened on seeing the
man-lion form of Lord Vi$!)U with the
claws reddened by the blood nowing from
the torn chest of the haughty demon
[Hirm)yakasipu]. May these claws g1ve

At first their authority is dlzarma and
then the religious activities are based on
the breaking up of a number of injunctions
of the Veda-s, .next comes the authority of
the former and later rules, and then
many kinds of analogy and conjecture,
overriding rules, causes that effect many
results, inseparable application and exi-
gencies brought on by unreason- thus
when we carefully consider the matter,
who may entrust the protection of the
Veda-s to Mim~msaka-s ? (A. A. R.).

The Kanva-s are at first full of humi-

under the grip of a citra [leopard], with
tears covering her face, with shaking hands,

married wife is enjoyed by good luck!

Oh ! maker of arrows, why have you
brought these highly valuable arrows here ?
Do you not see that this is a village of un-
cultivated people, which is well advertised
by its signs ? The leader of H1ese village-
folk says· pat ram [a vessel] for datram

A king, after having controlled his
senses should direct his attention to (the·
cultivation of) the following four branches
of learning, nameJy, anvilqiki, trayz, varfii

versed in them and acting according to
their precepts.
Anvik~iki, trayi,
l'arta and dandaniti -
these and these only are the fo~r· ete;nal
divisions of knowledge, that pave the way
of corporea] beings to happiness ..•
Anvik~iki deals with the knowledge of

.il.nvilqiki, trayi and viirtil are consi-
dered to be the most excellent of all
knowledge. But their presence is no avail
where dm;u/anW is neglected.
When a great leader of men attains
proficiency in daT}qanJti he becomes the
master of the other remaining branches of
knowledge.
Anvik:jiki is the science of spiritual
knowledge, for it inve~tigates the nature of
weal and woe of mankind ; one seeing the
real nature of things with the assistance of
iinvik:jiki renounces both joy and grief.

creeper bending slightly by the profusion of
flowers is leaning against the lower
branches of tr,ees, full of compassion ;
the trees, whose barks have been re·
moved foremerly for bark-garments, have
their wounds healed and are now ready to
undergo the lopping of their branches to
supply twigs for holy functions-(these are
the conditions prevalent) in this region of
the forest. (A. A. R.).

good poetry and who can remedy the
ailments when the Narmada-like life is

narrate all these woes ? (A. A. R.).

steady for a few days ; fortunes are as
transient as passing whims ; all pleasures are
as fleeting as flashes of lightning during
the cloudy [rainy] days ; and even the
close embrace around the neck (lovingly)
offered by the beioveds does not, likewise,
last long ; (hence, ob mortals I) have your

Has her body been fashioned by the
creator with the bow of Cupid ? The
bow is not there as she has become
helpless by separation from you ; there-

Patience for the tottering trees on its

The non-attainment is better for one
whose heart is aroused by hope, than the
attainment of the desired, since his desire
would become weaker if it would be
suppressed by the non-attainment. On the
other hand, the satisfaction caused by the
attainment of the desired would upset
greatly his stability and would spread
vehemently, like waters in case of a breach
in a dyke and would become unbridled.

it be ? For, the cool-rayed one, the moon,
the essence of nectar to the eyes of the
world bad his birth therein ; and who
remained steady on the matted hair of
Lord Siva even when the Ganga therein
was set in motion with waves when the
goddess Parvatl playfully pulled him by
his hair. (A. A. R.).
Even the half-dried leaves have fallen
down ; the splendour of flowers js now a
thing of the past ; not a single sprout is
springing afresh ; the frustrated birds with
no hope of fruit have flown away jn
different directions ; the wide-spread net-
work of the dry roots has reached down
the nether regions (vainly searching for
water) ; and yet the tree in the desert
region remains silent hopefully thinking
of (an early shower from) an untimely
cloud, (as optimism is a part of life).

In such a darkness as this, intense and
almost palpable, what delirious delight,
deliciously blended with guilty bashfulness,
bent on clandestine amours, grope their
way through the gloom, and, having fortui~
tously come together, rush into each
other's arms, kiss each other tenderly, dent
each other's limbs in amorous jocularity,
and, with their passion roused, embark
upon amatory dalliances; and then, too
late, realise that they have blundered into
the arms of their own wedded partners,
instead of those of the paramours they
thought.

At times not suitable for pleasure, the
amorous one spends her time with her
beloved in the basing house, in the garden,
or at a festival. Even at the shadow of
another girl, even at his casual talk with
another, she is angry with her lover; and
in misfortune and the like, she identifies
herself with him. Without going ·elsewhere
or doing anything else, she hangs upon
her lover, as a poor fragile old woman
clings to the evening sunlight in lhe winter.
When her lord turns aside on the bed,
she thinks it a separation, and even his
visit to the temple she looks upon as
absence in different part of the country.
From the flow of excess fondness, through
the manifestations of great attachment,
the woman follows her beloved like a
shadow, whether he walks or stands. (These
qualities of artfulness, confidence, endu· .
ranee, and passion, in the nature of
women, in the four stages of youth, mani-
fest themselves in the women's courting
of their Iovers) 1 . (M. Dillon's, M. Fowler's

Trees that grow too near the homes, if
they are thorny ones, cause fear from the
enemies ; if milk-exuding ones, they are
harmful to wealth; if fruit-bearing ones
cause diminution of progeny; even
their wood should be discarded. (A. A. R.). Then the forest-fire has passed away
owing to the down-pour of the near cloud,
the tree is threatened by the lightning;
he who has escaped from the crocodile's ,
throat, must fear to get drowned in the
ocean. Thus fate soon creates · a fresh
terror for the person who has warded off
a danger, in order that he may realise
the sweetness of the good fortune which
he is to enjoy afterwards. (M. A. Stein's

Tasty and wholesome food in fruit
and nuts, the ground the bed, tree-barks
for dress, holy grass and twigs for flowers,
the deer for sons, trees for friends-thus
obtainable without restraint are the articles
for clothing, food, shelter, gifts, enjoyment
and wealth; what better things are indeed
available to householders in homes 1 except
misery ! (A. A. R.).

With regard to food there is not even
a mention, seal of silence in the mouth,
the eyes well closed, the body in emacia·
tion, remaining in solitude and the mind
concentrated upon a single object,-thus
oh ! handsome man, methinks, she may be
performing a severe penance for your sake !

When a crow caws in a weeping
tnanner, it indicates danger to food
production ; if it does so in a fortress, it
foretells war ; and if it caws similar to
the shriek of a peacock, or produces
'kuva' and 1 kiki' sounds -these three
indicate danger to the city. (A. A. R,).

So true is it, that in no case can any
one guard a woman byforce in this world,
but the young woinan of good family is
ever p~otected by the pure restraint of her
own chastity.

merely a purposeless cause of suffering,
annoying others, and so far for being a
protection to women ; it rather excites in
them excessive longing. (C. H. Tawney's

Her face is verily the moon with the
radiance of the teeth and mark of sandal
on the forehead (to resemble to moon's
spot), her ear-ring constitutes a wheel of
the whetstone in sharpening the arrows of
her glances, her pearl-string is a stream
of the nectar of her smiles flowing in the
cavity between the breasts, and the tinkling
anklets set with sapphire at her lotus-feet
is a swarm of (humming) bees. (A . A. R.).

As his majesty knits his brow
(in anger), torrents of tears stream down
the eyes of the ladies of the enemy
hordes : For these eyes, a comparison
with the cakora-birds would be unequal on
account of the eyes' contempt of the moon
(which is liked by the birds, but shunned
by the frightened ladies); with the white
lotuses, the comparison would be inapt in
the matter of the eyes' remaining open at
night (while the lotuses close at night, the
ladies keep awake) ; with the black bees,
the comparison would be unsuitable on
account of the eyes' keeping away from
sidhu [wine or: honey] (which the bees
\
\ l
-~ '[ 1435
like, but the distressed ladies detest) ; with
the blue lotuses, the comparison would
be inappropriate in regard to the eyes'
excessive dejection in the autumnal season
(when the blue lotuses bloom, but when
the ladies become fearful of enemies'
attack). Here, I visualise but a singlc
object of comparison (for the eyes of the
ladies placed between the torrents of tears),
being the camarz-deer secretly sheltering
between streams caused by a constant and
heavy waterfall.

Imagining this well-shaped nose of the
young damsel to be the (charming) tila-
fl.ower, there arises immense pleasure in
the mind of the (love-longing) youth ; but,
oh ! friend, consider it as the venomous
and ferociously hissing lifted hood of a
cobra; do not desire for it and so avoid its
sight. ( S. Bbaskaran Nair's translation).
