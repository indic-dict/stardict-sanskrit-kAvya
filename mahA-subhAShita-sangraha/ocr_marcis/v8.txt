!AXPREFACE
The best of a group or a class that, by its very nature, lent
grace to the whole or contributed to its wealth was aptly termed
as 'gem' (ratnam) by the ancients. A stanza or a part thereof which
is likewise distinguished by uncommon poetic excellence, imparts
aesthetic pleasure to the connoisseur and has didactic overtones, and
thereby stands out from the common mass, is given the happy name
of subha~ita, a wise saying. In the poetic parlance subha~ita is but
21nother name of 'gem'. Well has it been said by the poet :
CJN~t •(\fur ~"' "'"! a;~ ~rf~l{ 1

A subhll~ita, when recited or heard, soothes the mind, comforts
the heart and invariably heightens one's awareness I knowledge in its
wide ramifications. The tiny jar of subhll~ita overflows with an
ocean of ra sa. By their inherent genius, the subha$itas encompass a
variety of subjects and evoke acceptance by their manifold virtues.
A large mass of the old wise-sayings is doubtless attributed to
the ancient poets, both known and unknown. But there is a sizable
segment of the subha$itas that has been handed down, over the ages,
by oral transmission, and thereby tends to suffer unwarranted inter·
polations. Even the well-equipped scholars are unable to identify their
authors with certainty. They continue to pass on as respectable but
anonymous adages, with everybody floating his own surmise about their
authors and sources.
The corpus of
subha~itas,
written do-nn th;! ages, is virtually
infinite. The lovely subha~itas that one encounters in the vast domain
of literature, both sacred and profane, concern themselves with
a spectn1m of subjects, voice the ethics of the day, reflect the
ideals and norms that guided the society in various vicissitudes,

and thus mtrror m
pective milieus.
PREFACE
brief the contemporary culture of the res-
It is hard to pinpoint what precisely prompted the cn1ergence
of the Subha~itas in Sanskrit. Being the summum bonum of all
knowledge, hun1an and div1ne, the Vedas may well be accepted as the
fountain-head of the Sanskrit Subhi1$itas. The Vedic Jiterature abounds
in unending strings of subha~itas of various hues and worth. The
Subha~ita-sangrahas ( collections of wise sayings ),
assiduously
compiled by competent authors to underscore their strong potential in
entertaining the cultured reader, and steering him to safe harbours in
the trying hours, seem to have led to the birth of independent genre
of the subha~ita-literature. The sangrahas are invested with con-
siderable historical importance. They embody the writings of a number
of such ancient authors as well, who are mere names to us. It is
seldom that they or their writings find mentions elsewhere. S01ne of
the sa:stric works (lak~a~a-granthas), and commentaries of the ancient
masters are known to preserve certain excerpts fr01n their writings.
Tbe fascination for collecting the subha#tas in book-form happily
grew stronger over the years, and subsequently struck deep roots.
Of the known Subhll$ita-sangrahas, the Kavindra -samuccaya
of the unknown author, is the earliest. The richness of its contents
and its antiquity combine to lend it considerable significance. It is
followed by Va:kpatir~ja's Subhll~itasandoha which consists of 922
wise sayings, c1assified into thirty two prakara'f)as. Written in the
thirteenth century, the Saduktikar~J,amrta of Sndharadasa, purpo.t ts
to be a unique collection. Jalhar:ta's Suktimuktavali, though a slim
volume, is invested with great charm. Distinguished by a wealth of
contents and written in a lucid style, the Sarngadharapaddhati. holds
the pride of place in the annals of the sangrahas. Its 4689 verses
make it a hefty volume. The Subha~itzzvali of Vallabhadeva also engages
attention. Prof. Bohtlingks Indische Spruche (Bharatiya-suktayab)
makes a departure from the rut of the earlier collections. It is
comprised cf thousand verses, drawn from the earlier available san.grahas,
which are accompanied by a readable German translation by the
author himself.

of the other important collections of Subha~itas that are available
in print or arc preserved in the MS. form. Like the preceding
sarigrahas they too are marked by rich contents and serve as worthy
guides to good conduct.
A perceptive study of the corpus of the Subha~ita-smigrahas
led the latt" Professor Ludwik Sternbach to conclude that a new
multi-volume sangraha was still a desideratum. The collection, as
he visualised it, should include the invaluable treasure of wise-
sayings scattered in the earlier sangrahas , both published and
unpublished, and in works on such diverse disciplines as Arthas~stra
and medicine, which contain a wealth of verses that have m erit place in
the sangrahas but have been unjustly denied. He set upon the
task in right earnest to give shape to the idea. He patiently culled
a vast mass of subha~itas, not only from the published collections
but from a number of manuscripts deposited with various libraries
and museums as \VeiL Not only that, he painstakingly prepared
tables of the variant readings thrown up by different editions I versions
of the respective works, and opted in the text for the reading he
found n1ost tenabk, on critical evalu1tion, relegating others to the
footnotes under various verses. It is a measure of his zeal that,
besides others, he admitted to his magnum opus such verses as well,
as are descriptive in character, highlight human beauties, behaviour
of birds and beasts in various situations and deal with omens of
cifferent hues. A sizable number of verses, which though shorn of
poetic beauties, have been included in the collfction because of the
judicious application of the figures of speech. Some of the verses
included therein can hardly claim to be su.bhil~ita.s, but have been
accommodated because the editor (author; finds some latent charm inPREFACE
them, howsoever evasive that may be. With a view to bring the text
within the reach of the non-Sanskritic readership, Prof. Sternbach
decided to append English translation to the verses. He reproduced
the translation of such verses as had been rendered into English by
competent Scholars in their editions of the various texts or elsewhere.
He continued with translating the rest till his end.
Prof. Sternbach meticulously edited some of the proposed
volume5:, prepared their transcripts, and with a view to have them
published met Dr. Vishva Bandhu, the founder- Director of the
Institute. He apprised the Acharya of the detalls of the gigantic project
that was visualised to run into twenty sizable volumes. Dr. Vishva
Bandbu was quick to grasp the importance and magnitude of the
work. In view of its suitability and wide dimensions, he consented
to publish it from the Institute, and appropriately named it
M ahasubha~ita- sangraha.
lt .. is to be noted that of the twenty proposed volumes of the
M ahl1subhl1~ita-sangraha, Dr. Sternbach, in his life time, could collect
material for ten volumes only. Beginning with the Devanagari letter
q- (A), they span verses upto ~~~sctl~r;r 9; ( Sukraniti, 4. 7- 201 ).
The present volume, eighth in the Series, contains 1635 verses, from
~~T'! qT~CiT'! (13019) to ~?.i ~;:~;r··· · .... (14653).
As mentioned in the preceding volumes, five volumes of
the Mah?Jsuhh~sita- Sangraha were published in the Jife-time of
Prof. Sternbach. He used to send to the institute the duly edited
text with E1glish translation, Foot Notes and Appendices from his home
in Europe. The scholars at the institute subjected the transcript to
rigorous scrutiny and made changes wherever necessary. It was
then that the Vo1umes went to the press. It is worthwhile to recall
that the first five volumes were brought out by the institute within
the space of mere eight years, from 1974 to 1981. This was the
time when Prof. Sternbach was alive. Six years intervened before the
the sixth volume could be published. Volume Seven to'Jk an inordi-
nately long time of thirteen years to come out, under the editorship cf
Prof. S. Bhaskaran Nair, the Director of the institule.J After Prof. Nairretired from the service of the institute, I edited the Sanskrit text of the
eighth volume with the critical apparatus followed in preparing the
earlier volumes. The English translation was done by Sh. Shambhu Dutt
] oshi, the Joint Director of the institute. 1 n deference to the wishes
of the Executive Board of the institute, I contacted several eminent
scholars like Dr. Satya Vrat Shastri, Dr K. V. Sarma and Dr. S. N.
Bhardwaj for revising the English translation. They expressed their
inability to undertake the task for one reason or the other. At the
instacce of Dr. Satya Vrat Shastri, I ultimately approached Dr. Satya
Vrat Varma, Former Ptincipal and a noted writer and contributor
On our request he consented to translate the text de novo. The
English translation printed in the volume was done, by and large,
by Dr. Varma. The translation of some of the verses done by other
scholars, has been printed under their names.
Dr. Satya Vrat
occasionally found it necessary to translate some such verses also as
had been translated earlier by scholars of repute. That accounts for
two translations of some of the subha~itas. The name of the translators
of some of the verses, however, could not be identified
Of the verses included in the volume, the number of verse that
is marked by crisp proverb or add.ge, is printed without the asterisk
mark.
The verse that is invested with poetic excellence or son1e
other distinction has its number printed with one asterisk mark. Such
verses as have been included in the present volume by virtue of their
edraordinary poetic excellence or some such other reason, though
they were in the earlier volumes in different garb, are printed with two
asterisk marks on their respective r.umbers (Page 4030 No. 13523).
Not unlike in the preceding \Oiumes, the subha~itas have been
meticulously edited and printe I in the volume in the order of the
Devana:gari letters. The sour .:e of the verse has been mentioned under
the category (aT); the verse that has been reproduced from other work
or is quoted in other work is noted under (arr) and verses that are drawn
from other sources find mention under (i). The variant readings,
if any, in the four quarters of a verse are sequentially noted under (a,,
(b), (c) and (d) that, like the aforesaid categories, follow the printed
text of the verse.xxii

It is my mora1 duty to express gratitude to my colleagues in the
inatitute and other friends and schoJars who helped me in bringing
out the volume First of all, I tender homage to the sacred memory
of Acharya Vishva Bandhu Ji whose blessings continue to spur us in
our literary ventures. This institute itself is an abiding testimony to his
wide erudition and vision. I also remember with fondness Dr. Ludwik
Sternbach whose Mahasubha$ita-sangraha epitomises his life-long
commitment to learning, and stands out as a unique treasure of
Sanskrit subha.~itas
I am indebted, on counts 1nore than one, to
Prof. Bhaskaran Nair. th~ former Director of the institute, who edited
the seventh voume with great ability. It was he who initiated me into
the nuances of the art of editing ancient texts. To him I offer 1ny
grateful thanks.
I express my gratitude to Dr. (Mrs) Kanal Anand, PrincipaL
Aditi College, University of Delhi for the promptness with which
she consented to introduce the Volume to the scholarly world by
contributing Foreward to it. As a noted author and receipient of
many awards and honours, she was well equipped to perform the
task with credit
Thanks are due to Dr. Satya Vrat Varma. In a rare display of
magnanimity, he acceded to my request to translate the volume into
English and to read the final proof-sheets. He did the job with zeal
and devotion. His translation has the merit of unravelling the true
import of the text. · It is neither a literal translation nor a free
rendering. It is true to its name (anuvada). It voices the spirit of the
original in lucid phraseology, without straying from the text.PREFACE
xxiii
Prof. T. S. Bindra deserves my sincere thanks and blessings.
He has worked closely with me in editing the volume, correcting the
proof-sheets and preparing the Subject Index. Dr. Dev Raj Sharma
has been a pillar of strength to me. It is the unstinted help of these
two colleagues that has been instrumental in bringing out the volume
in time. Sh. Shrikant Ofiice Supdt. of the Institute, Sh. Rakesh Sharma,
the \1anager of the Printing Press of the Institute and his colleagues
Sh. On1 Prakash Thekedar and Rajendra Prasad carried out the printing
of the volume with great care and sincerity. May God bless them.
This colourful bouquet of Mahasuba~ita- sarigrah. lovingly
strung by a galaxy of devoted scholars, is gratefully dedicated to the
sacred men1ory of Acharya Vishva Bandhu Ji. May his spirit continue
to enlighten our path.*

(anusvllra) Cinta is formidable on the

person, no matter how brave and learned
be is.

short time even a bulky corpse, so anxiety
consumes alive even a valiant and learned man,
