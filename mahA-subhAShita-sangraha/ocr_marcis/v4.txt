The M aha-subha~ita-samgraha, Volume IV, is being issued by
the V. V. R. Institute, as No. 73 of its Vishveshvaranand Indological
Series. It .js a matter of gratjfkation for this Institute that the earlier
three volumes of the work had been received warmly both by the
Sanskrit scholars and by the general reading public, as attested by the
reviews of the said volumes published in prominent periodicals and
the approbatory correspondence on these volumes received in this
Office. The present volume takes off from where the third volume had
ended and records 2000 verses, numbered 6286 to 8264, beginning with
the Devanagari letters "::I" to ''otl'', including 21 extra verses.
The pattern adopted in the previous volumes has been followed
in the present volume too. The wise sayings and entertaining verses,
as culled from a wide variety of texts, including those of Indian origin
preserved in the 'Greater Indian' literatures, such as those of Tibet,
Ceylon, Indonesia, Cambodia and other countries, have been carefully
edited and presented in Devan.ilgari characters, with the indication of
their primary, secondary and 'Greater Indian' sources. This is followed
by the variant readings found in the different sources. A readable
translation of the Sanskrit text into English follows, enabling the non-
Sanskritist reader to grasp the innate wjsdom and poetic charm contai~
ned in the verses. Short notes, in the form of footnotes, are added,
wherever necessary, to explain contexts, indicate the persons referred
to and point out a11usions. Three indexes have also been compiled for
the volume, being : I. Index of Authors and Sources, wherein brief
details of the individual authors and also of the works are given, with
the enumeration of the verses under their sources ; 11. Index of
Sanskrit Metres, wherein the verses couched in the same metre, other
than Anu~tubh, have been collected and enumerated ; and, Ill. Subject
Index, in which the innumerab]e topics dealt with or referred to in the
yerses have been indentified and indexed alphabetically, with cros~-vi
EDITORIAL
references wherever needed. It is to be hoped that this Volume will
receive from its cultured readers the same approbation as was accorded
to the earlier volumes.
The painstaking labour that Dr. Ludwik Sternbach has put in
towards the preparation of this volume is better visualised than stated.
Our Institute is highly indebted to Dr. Sternbach for compiling this
Volume for publication by the Institute. While the present writer has
had the privilege of editing the Volume intensively, revising entries
as needed, supplying short notes and fresh translations wherever
necessary, checking references and variant readings, and seeing the
publication through the press, he had always at hand the unstinted
co-operation of Dr. K. V. Sarma, Director-Professor of the sister
institution, the Vishveshvaranand Vishva Bandhu Institute of Sanskrit
and Indological Studies. Thanks are, again, due to Dr. Sarma for the
help he rendered towards the compilation of the Subject Index.
We are also grateful to the authorities of the Akhila Bharatiya
Sanskrit Parishad, Lucknow for arranging to release the Volume at a
function soon to be held in honour of the author Dr. Sternbach to
felieitate him on his completing 70 years of successful existence. Our
Institute heartily felicitates Dr. Sternbach over his achievements and
feels happy to offer this bouquet of poetic effusions to him on this
memora hie occasion, with the words :

Claiming that it has already been
said, saying that it would be explained,
threatening remark; looking away, speaking

The legs of Dlwrma [righteousness]
which had been destroyed in the Iron age
were brought into being freshly by him
and the chariot of his legs was thus
restored ; and those who reached the sun
after being chastised by your arrows made
a report of the same ; bearing this account,
the legless charioteer of the sun, leaving
his master, will serve you, oh ! king.

speech and answer (of the lovers) are

quarrels and conciliations arc done in
silence, where kissing is done noiselessly-
when such arc things, all is well there;

With a face that blooms (with joy),
shining with high· bosom, the curved eye-
the
brows with playful movements,
charming body (slightly) wet with sweat,
with shyness fast disappearing, and with
hairs standing on ends, oh 1 charming one,
fortunate is that young man on whose
face you now cast your glances that
resemble a line of foam in the great milky
ocean. (A. A. R.).

birth is on the first day of the
lord of gods heralding universal rejoicing ;
great is its fame on all auspicious days
[as recipient of oblations]; it lives a full
life, fulJ of courage; and it quarrels with
enemies (dreadful) like Sri Ra:ma and has
such an importance in astrology [science of
omens]-because of these qualities, the
crow fi11ds a place in a golden cage.

Where groups of good qualities that
are characteristic of good birth have been
well established, rules of conduct do not
come into conflict with the ancient ones,
there is no Jimit in giving artha [wealth or :
meanings]; uha [resourcefulness or : guessing]
is resplendent everywhere, and all artha-
v(Jda-s [promises of gift or : explanatory re-
marks] are true ; thus, your form has taken
up a new kind of appearance as the rules

that was crossed by Hanuman, the great

limit, it is within the primordial egg of
Brahman; thus everything in this world
appears to be circumscribed; but limitless
is the discriminating sense of the good
people alone. (A. A. R.).

That deafening roar, a fever to the
ears of travellers who are anxious to
reach the seashore (for .coolness) and
whose eyes are drooping by the rays of
the piercing sun, has been started by the
sea; where was this roar of the waves of
the mighty sea, whose mind is unbridled
in giving pain to others, concealed when
it entered into the folded palm (to be-
come a mouthful) of the Sage [Agastya] ?
the king afflicts the path, there is an
army of clouds-six wells at the tip of a

the Ganga there (?). (A. A. R.).

of the (present) epoch, may the Lord
Vimu in his incarnation as Kalki, who
rises as the tranquillizer of the Iron age,
protect you all from dangers ! (A. A. R.).
When your face is present, oh.! charming
lady, that is pleasing by its pride of
possession of youth, and far superior to
the intoxication brought on by ·wine,
possessing a swarm of bees in the form of
your glances, that dart love in all its
charming glory, the moon loses its beauty
and remains dull ; and the lotuses too,
devoid of charm (in comparison) do not
blossom forth at night, oh ! banana-thighed
one. (A. A. R.).

If fate is kindly inclined, it makes a
person whose mind is absorbed by the
thought of his growing wretched poverty,
lose his way, heplessly fall suddenly over

stored away by somebody else. Thus
look, fate removes from him his poverty
(in retum) for a broken limb.

in the lilies that adorned her ears, (the

spreading lustre of her blossoming eyes,

inferred only by its fragrance and there
you were buzzing for a short while ; tell

With what aguish of heart do those
wayfarers pass these weary· vernal days,
far away from their beloved ones ! The
shrill notes of the kokjla-s, esconced
among the leafy niches of the cl:Ua-trees,
whose clusters of myriad blossoms wave
gently in the breeze, weighed down by
the swarms of rapacious bees that hum
around them, drawn thereto by the
honeyed aroma-these warblin.gs of the
kolcila~s sear the ears of those
pmmg
lovers and raise their anguish to fever
pitch. And, separated from their dear
ones as they are, these love-lorn way-
farers sink languidly into a reminiscent
mood wherein, like yogins, they contemplate
deeply and tenderly on these delights that
erstwhile they culled during their past
dalliances with their mistresses, dearer far
to them than their very Jives. (S. Lak~mi­

All the actions and omissions of a king
should be examined by
his
loyal
attendants, whose honesty has been tested
by the upadha-s · and who follow up their
schemes until they are successful.
Upadha is so called because it brings .
. people near the king and can make them
enter into his service. Upadhli-s are the
means for testing honesty, and by these a
king should try his dependents. (M. N.

No second fault is noticeable

regarded by men as weak and imbecile.
Oh ! thou of great wisdom, this attribute

Its merits are many.
By forgiveness (which is only another
form of self-control), the man of self-

worlds. (P. C. Ray's translation).

Born of the same one king, [the

fierce by [the advice of] wicked people,
fight with one another and thus (noble)
families are annihilated along with other
good people ; just as the bamboos which
are produced in the same mountain

thorns, are reduced to ashes along with

With one angry eye she gazes on the
orb of the sun as it tarries on the horizon;
with the other, dimmed by her tears, she
looks on her soul's beloved; thus the
mate of the cakraraka, feeling the
approach at nightfall of separation from
her dear one, expresses two emotions,
even as a clever actress. (A. B. Keith's

One (poet) emerged from the lotus
[Brahma], another from a sandy island
[Vyasa], yet another from an ant-hill
[Valmiki]-all these poets (of yore) are
revered preceptors ; our obeisance to them.
If, however, any later poet is posited as
imparting delight through their prose and
poetic compositions, I [Vijayanka], the
poetess-consort of the KarJJata king,
shall (subjugate them and) place my
left foot on their heads (in victory).
( S. Bhaskaran Nair's translation). Eternal and one is my soul which ex-
periences happiness and unhappiness but
is of the nature of seeking true knowledge;
no other thing is really mine, such as the
body, wealth, senses, brothers, wife,
pleasures and other things ; all the fickle·
ness and unhappiness are born of selfish
actions and vain is my delusion therein ;
thus, oh ! life [soul], think over this care-
fully ; may you resort to the path of

A frog havjng reached a very small
puddle becomes supremely happy and goes
on croaking loudly and endlessly 'ko me,
ko me' ['who is like me ?'] out of in~
tolerant pride i but the great ocean having
received the waters of all the rivers such
as the Ganga and others and possessing a
good number of gems do<;:s not have any
pride. (A. A. R.).
The one ocean alone really lives in
the world and all other waters are but its
(transformed) collections ; for, clouds
having somehow drunk a little water out
of its waters give joy to the world for a
long time (by rain). (A. A. R.).

not take delight in [aspire for] heaven
even for a moment as there is always the
apprehension of being thrown out of it

It is the syllable 'Om' of the brahmaJ}a
Cupid i it is the one sharp fang of the
boar of the sky; it is the oyster for the
pearls in the form of stars, and the goad
to the elephant of blinding darkness; it is
the key to open the bolt in the door of
love; it serves as a pair of scissors to cut
the jealous anger of separated women; it is
the nail-mark on the harlot of evening

shine. (A. A. R.).

A girl in love sucks at her lips, her
eyes stray about like fish in a river-pool,
she wears flowers in her hair, binds it up
and then lets it down again ; her breasts
show through her clothes, her buttocks
likewise-her girdle keeps slipping how-
ever tightly she ties it.
All these things
serve in a woman to make known that
she is in love.
If she longs for a man as often as his
face, his good looks, his conversation,
his virtues and his affection are praised;
and if, when he is not present, she delights
in hearing news of his acquaintances and
his friends-this too is a sign that she is
in love. (A. Comfort's translation).
