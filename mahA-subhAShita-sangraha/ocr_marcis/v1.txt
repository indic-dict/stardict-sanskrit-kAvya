''PREFACE
The endeavours of Th. Aufrecht in his ''Beitrage zur Kem1tni~s
indicher Dichter" 1 and F. W. Thomas in his Introduction to the Kav1ndravacana-
samuccaya2 to give a list of poets quoted in different subhlt$ita-sanigraha-s have
proved to be very useful for our closer acquaintance with the literature of ancient
and mediaeval India. These poets would have been completely unknown to us
if their names and verses bad not been preserved in the Sanskrit subhet~ita­
samgraha-s and in the subha#ta-samgraha-s of 'Greater India'.
The aim of the prese.nt Mah~-subha~ita-sarhgraha is to continue to
a much larger extent the work begun by Otto Bohtlingk who in three big volumes
collected, edited and translated into German 7613 verses (he called them Svruche ;
but I prefer to call them subhll$ita-s), as well as of Th. Aufrecht and F. W.
Thomas who gave lists of authors quoted . in various subhel~ita~samgraha-s with
indications where they occurred.
It has been emphasized several times before that "an up-to-date com-
pendium containing all the known subhct~ita-s arranged in an alphabetical order
is still a necessity". 3 The opinion has also been eJCpressed several times that if
anthologies in Sanskrit were to be exploited in any si~nificant manner for the study
of the history of Sanskrit literature (the importance of the subha~ita-s for the
history of Sanskrit literature is widely admitted), comprehensive indices and con-
cordances of all the available anthologies would have to be prepared; they would
also provide a compass to those who navigate in the ocean of subhi'.l~ita litera-
ture.' The present Maba-subha~ita~sarbgraha is intended to fill this gap.
The work on the present Maha-subhll~ita-sarhgraha was started m
1966 and the first volume is appearing only today. First, extensive indices of
subhi1$ita-s were to be prepared and then only could the editing of individual
subha#ta-s be started. By now, eight and a half volumes, containing some 18.000

PREFACE
subhC1$ita-s beginning with letters~ to~. are readv for printing; it mny be n."sumed
that the entire Mnha-subha~ita-sari1graha will have to be puhl1shrd in some
twenty volumes, plus additional volumes for verses whkh came to lw known to me
(or in the coarse of the preparation of the followin.:4 volu11es will come to be
known to me) from sources either not published at the time when I stnrted the
worP or from subhil,~ita-sanigraha-s preserved only in mnnnscripls which I d1d not
have at my disposal at that tirne 2 or several subhn,~ita-.1mj1/Zralw-s, the existence
of which came only recently to my notice.
The present Maba-subh~~ita-sarhgraha is bnsed on all the subh?J~ita-sam­
graha-s, available to me, which are mentioned in the Introduction bdow.: 1 At the
beginning of each volume the list of autbors quoted in the stdJI.Cl,lita-.wn'lr:raha-s is
given and at the end a subject index, since the subhir,<;ita-s ;1rc quoted in alphabeti-
cal order and not accordinr.: to sub!ect matter;;. Thr. alpllabc:ticnl system seems to
be particularly convenient for r bi1ol0gjcal st"cdies and /or th~ ca!'icr findin).! of the
subha~ita-s 4 , provided that a subject index is also attachedr. for those who want
to find references to a specific topic and porticularly for non-specialists who may
find the Maha-subba~ita-saii<graha useful for the study d Jndim1 civilisatic1n.
As mentioned in the Introduction (para 12.1 ), there exist three }.!roups of
subhll~ita-samgraha-s :
(1) tbose composed viitunll.v of sententious snyin[:(s ;
(2) those composed virtually of quotations from litcr:ny work~. p:u:ticnlnrly
"beautifully turned" and e1oquently said, as well ;1s dc~1hnl! with the description
of nature, different moods, suggestions or an:vollti-s ~md (3) mixed, i.e., includin).!

~!clitionPREFACE
both types of subhet~ita-s.
The present Maha-subhll:!ilta-sath~traha belongs to the
third category and contains not only wise s1ying.s, but also stray poetical verses.
That seemed to me to be necessary, sinca most of the Sanskrit subhe~ ~ita­
samgraha-s belong to the third group of anthologies and one of the aims of
the present work is to include in it, among others, all the verses quoted in the
already known subt.a!~ita-sanigraha-s.
All subha?ita-s included in the subha$ita-sarngraha~s are quoted and
edited 1 in the Maha:-mbha~ita-sari1graba, though some, from the poetical
point of view, may not be considered as "su%11?ita-s". Not all subhil,~ita-s
found in the s/.tbhasita-scw1.graha-s are wise sayings, 2 nor pure poetry, 3 but,
being considered as useful by the compiler of a sub ha sita-san'l.f!,raha, were included
by him in his anthology·! and therefore included m this Maba-subha~ita­
saii1~raha ; they should not, however, be included in an anthology of poetry par
excellanre. 5 Even not all "poetical subha.'fita-s" have a. great poetical value and,
thus, might be considered as ''us~les~," 6 but since they were already included in a
.mbhil~ita-smil!!raha, they are also included in the present Maba-subha~ita­
saJi1graha. Also for the same reason some subhl1$ita·s included in subhi'2$ita-
sari~E!raha-s, though it1correctly construed are reproduced in the present work. 7

7. 1 did not wish to follow in the foot-steps of 0. B~htlingk who very often, may be
even sometimes too often, corrected the readings of wmc suiJ/tt1!}ita s; I preferred to leave
even gramntically incorrect re<Idings if there was no sufficient ~ource materiJ.l for their
improve" mcnt.

if they were translations or adaptation· of Sanskrit texts, were included in the
present work. even if they are unknown today, Therefore, we find, for instance,
in the Maha-subha~ita-sam~raba verses from the Nitisa:stra of Masllrl!lk.$a
(e.g., No. 569), the ori€,inal source of which is not known.
Tn addition to the subnii~ita-s it1cluded in the various subhi:l~ita-sarhgraha-s,
a great part of Sanskrit literature was studied by me and subhil§ita-s (wise sayings
and some descriptive verses) from these works were culled and quoted in the
Maba-subba~ita-sarilgraha. 1
The choice was made by me and I alone am responsi-
ble for the selection. I expect criticism in this respect and questions why I chose
one verse and omitted another. Many of these criticisms will be well taken, but
what is pleasing to one person does not need to be pleasing to another. All the
criticisms will be welcomed and suggestions will be gladly received; the
sublil1$ita-s additionally suggested might then be added in the supplementary
volume(s) with the name of the proposer.
The original plan of the work was to collect and critically edit th~
subha$ita-s. The publisher insisted, howev:er, that a translation of each verse
should be supplied ; he thought that the Maha-subha~ita-sarhgraha would also
arpeal to non-specialist who~e knowledge of Sanskiit is limited. I reluctantly
agreed to tbis suggestion, but felt that I alone would not be able, in view of the
enormous task before me, to cope with both the collecting and editing as well as
translating. Therefore, whenever I found an English translation of a subhl1~ita,
already rrepared by a Sanskrit scholar, I included it in the Mah~-mbh~~ita­
sa:tbgraba2 ; subhlJ$ita-s which I particularly liked and especially those belonging to
the collections of wise sayings attributed to Caoakya 3 (and wbich I started to trans-
late already) I translated myself.' The remaining subhf:l$ita-s were translated by
Mr. A. A. Ramanatban of the Adyar Library and Research Centre6 who consented
1. However V~da-s, Upani~;~ad.s, etc., as well as Buddhist and Jainistic texts were not
taken into consideration. I do not have sufficient knowledgl! to deal with theEe text@ 1 but do
hope that in addition to tbe existing subh1it~ita-sati1graha.·s (e.g., Vishva Bandbu's Vcda8astra-
samgra ha ; see lntro. para 50.2 below) another Malln-subha{lita·samgra.ha for these texts will
appear one day.

verse. See also fn. 4 below.

wholehearted thanks to him for the work done.
I wish to present my
I also wish to express my infinite gratitude to Pan.dit Dr. K. P. Aithal,
at present Professor of Indology at the University of Heidelberg, for his gracious
and valuable advice and help in the preparation of the present volume of the
Maba-subha~?ita-samgraha. His suggestions were always to the point and were
:readily accepted by me. I also take this opportunity to express my sincerest thanks
to Dr. S. K. Chatterji, National Professor of India in Humanities; Dr. R. N.
Dandekar, Professor at the University of Poona : Dr. Gauri Nath Shastri, former
Vice-Chancellor, Sanskrit University, VarliQasi ; Dr. V. Raghavan, former
Professor and Head of the Department of Sanskrit, University of Madras; Prof.
K. V. Sarma, Vishveshvaranand Institute, Panjab University; and Dr. Vibhuti
Narain Singh, former ruler of Banaras, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the
All-India Kashiraj Trust, Varat).asi for providing me useful information and
helping me otherwise, in various ways, in the prcduction of this work. I am
beholden to the late Ac~rya Dr'. Vishva Bandhu Sastri, former Joint Secretary
and Director of the Vishveshvaranand Vedic Research Institute, who always
supported me in my plan and endeavours relating to the Maha-subha~ita-scnbgraha
and I am happy to add that I continue to receive the same help and encourdge-
ment frorp his worthy successor Principal Rala Ram. Sri S. Bhaskaran Nair,
Deputy Director, Vishveshvaranand Vedic Research Institute, has been my
right hand in the matter of seeing the work through the press. I am extremely
glad to note that the present work has been greatly benefitted by 'the expertise
which he has brought to bear in its editorial processing and final presentation.
Finally, I wish to express my thanks to tb~ Vishveshvaranand Vedic Research
Institute, Hoshiarpur and to M/s. Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi for accepting the
manuscript of the present volume for publication, despite the high cost of
printing and the rather cumbersome nature of the manuscript.
The Maha-subba~ita-!=arhgraha is construed in the following manner. Each
1
subhet.~ita has a serial number, the text with the indication of the source follows:
for details on the latter the "Abbreviations'' and Ind~x of Authors and Sources
of Individual verses (pp. 319-37~) should be consulted.
The sources are
divided into three categories : primary sources, denoted by o;q : secondary sources
•
denoted by~~ : and sources from 'Greater India' denoted by ll:; then variants are
registered and the name of the metre used is given ; 2 and finally the English
1. As explained before, the numbers without an asterisk denote wise sayings, with one
asterhk denote poetical or desctiptive subhapita·s and with two asterisks denote such verse:J
which are neither wise sayings nor poetical or descriptive subha~ita-s and should not be
included in an anthology of poetry, but were included in the Mahl-subhitl)itaMsamgraba only
because they appeared in a subha~ita·samgraha.

translation with the name of the translator in brackets at the end of the
translation is supplied 1• (For the bibliographical data of the translators the
"Abbreviations" should be consulted).
In each volume of the Maha:-subha$ita-sarhgraha the following items are
also included :
1. A list of abbreviations which serves also as a guide for bibliographicnl
data of the sources quoted and on their translations.
2. An index of authors and sources of individual
subha~ita-s
included in
the volume. This ltst contains the minimum necessary inform<1tion about cClch
author or source cited, as well as bLbliographicai references to more detailed
information about these authors and sources. At the end of each entry r.umbcrs of
verses cited in the volume where the authors and/or sources are quoted is ~iven, as
well as (in brackets) the subhi1~ita-smilgraha-s in which the appropriate subhtl,)ita
occurs. This· list might be of value for students of tbe history of Indian
literature, since it will give references also to poets who are ftenerally unknown
and are quoted exclusively in subha~ita-samgraha ·s.
An index of metres other than sloka-s or anu.Hu7J-s, used in the
subhil~ita-s quoted in the volume, the reference number~ of the conupt metres

4. A subject index of the subhCliita-s quoted jn the volume. Jt is intended
to prepare a collective subject-index of all the volumes on the completion of the

INTR-ODUCTION
Wiae aayias
1. The Sanskrit literature has reached its apogee-in its didactic poetry
with thousands of moral maxims, ethical teachings and wise sayings. This
floating· expression of sound judgment's preserved in metriCal form are mines of
practical good s~nse and e-Vidence 'the wi'sdom of the Hindus which elevated
them to a high position among th~ nation.s 'of tbe globe. 1
2. Indian authors displayed a profound knowledge of. human nature
with all the weaknesses and defects and have given'. sound moral ad~ ice with
respect .to various: situa.tions ini · whiCh human• beings were likely to wound up.
These autbots,particularly ·believed. that the present conduct of humans is .a result
of · previous existence and· therefore their ·present action · will.- heavily . bear on
their· future. Consequently ·these actions· should be good arid moral and thus
bring happiness
future life. ; In order to help the- individuals- to conduct
themselves properly they gave them moral and ethical advice, moral and ethical
guidance and instruction in 'practical wisdom; that gave rise to the didactic

INTRODUCTION
poetical skill being exhibited in the intricate play of words which created a
slight wit, humour or satire; they arose laughter, scorn, compassion and other
moods. Often these short pieces of excellent -poetry written by known poets
and containing universal truths be.came .!lenerally adopted as wise and pleasing
expression of verity, so that ultimately their ~authorship was forgotten and they
became authorless. These are subha~ita-s or sakti-s-sayings, epigrams, sententious
precepts, didactic teachings.

3. According to Buddhist teachings subhll~its-s w~re well spoken words
"filled with dhamma and not with adhatf'ma" ; they were spoken in a pleasant

4. From the sententious· precepts three other types ·of ;sayings mu,t be
discerned,· viz. (1) quotations from literary San·skrit works of ·authors known
or unknown being either· descriptive verses ol' single poetical verses ·standing by
itself in which the poet by means of · a few strokes depicted a . single phase of
emotion or a sirigle interesting situation within the limit of a finely finished
. .
form : (2) . popular maxims or adages ; and . (3). proverbs.
4. t The quotations from literary sources,· also ·~beauti~ully turned'; and
el<)quently_ said (subhet~ita-s, sakti-s) wer~ often quoted. at the· king;s 'court·.·
The use of such quotations in conversations proved tliat. the person. who cit~d
them was know:Jedgeable in Sariskrit literature and aneru4ite.
. ..
4.2 •. .The popular maxims ·and adages_,... satra-s, were short simple
unadorned sayings, not construed in . poetical form• ~but containing -some. wise
observations handed down from antiquity: they were usually attributed to a
known p2rsonality, e.g., to Brhaspati, to ·Cal)akya and others and, hence, became
' known as Barbaspatya-sntr.a~s, Ca:l)a;kya-sutra-s,. etc. . .

Subjects dealt with in·the sayings .
6. · Probably .no -other literature of the world can be compared with
Sanskrit literature as far as the variety of subjects dealt with in short epigrams
is concerned. Sanskrit poets cultivated poetry to such an extent that every work,
whether ;on love :or :hate, Hfe or 1leatb, but even .on law.; philosophy/logic, medicine,
horses or manure was written ·in verse. The condensation ~of thoaght in a short
verse was masterly performed and epigrams on different subjects of life are
found in almost all poetical works. They were composed in verse because their
shortness and condensed nature made it easier to a common reader to commit
them to memory.
Forms of sayings
7. Subhlt~ita-s and sakti-s were usually construed in ·a four vada verse-a
sloka or an anuHubh-where a thought, a truth, was condenSed in four pfJda-s.
. But not always so. Sometimes two pada-s or even one Jpada proclaimed a truth
and two or three pnda-s illustrated this truth by an example or with an episode
from Sanskrit literature : Purat;1a-s, epics, etc. So .. for instance, K$emendra's
Carucarya.§ataka£and its imitation Dya Dviveda's .NttimanjarJ, Kusumadeva's
Dr~tantasataka, Gum!ni's Upade.§a4ataka or Puri2t;aD.rthasamgraha were construed.
7.1. We find an example of a four pada verse containing one thought in
, verses quoted above. To illusttate·.a second kind .of· ~ubhtz~ita a verse from the
Dntantasataka of Kusumadeva (60) 1 is quoted; we read there:

!then they were also attributed in majorem· gloriam to a well known author ; so
probably Bhartrhari's epigrams and the so-called Cal).akya's sayings became known.
9. On ·the other .hand, beginni.ng from the tenth century A. D. m~ny
authors understanding that subhMita~s developed literary ability and good, taste,
were teaching right behaviour of cultured men and possibly also, in order to' ,s~ve
them from disappearat.tce had connected different wise saying's and/or descriptive
verses of known to them contemporary or earlier poets and included them in
collections of subhet~ita·s, antbologiesof Sanskrit poetry~ wh~ch were called ko§a-s,
subhasita-samgraha-s and a variety of similar names. A ko!la is defined in the
Stthityadarpa'(la (6.308) as : :. ·

(A compilation of verses, independent of one ·another and arranged
according to divisions (vrajYZ:Z-~) : this is particularly' beautiful). In other words
a subhz:zsita-samgraha is a collection of . stray verses composed by various poets
and di~ided according to subject matters; how that division has to .be done
. depended on the compiler of the collection. There ~xist hundreds .of su~h
subha~ita-samgraha-s of .which only a few were edited.
10. Although the arrangement ·of the different subha~ita-sanitraha-s
depended on the individuality ofthe compilers, their contents is stereotyped 1 and
the verses quoted are often identical, since the compilers drew often upon similar
sources. Several subhel$ita-samgraha-s are divided according to the three or four
puru§artha-s and deal with dharma, artha, kama and, in some· instances, also with
mok~a. The first Prl!krit subha$ita-samgraha-s, the Saktiratnahilra, the Subhel~ita-:­
sudhcz-nidhi and some Tamil anthologies (e.g., the NalatiYilr and the Tir~..:k~kural)
are so divided. The division of Bhartrhari's epigrams and some'collect.i.ons of stray
verses based ,on these. epigrams is similar ; these collections are, divided·: into , three
parts-n!ti (dharma and artha), vairo.g:va (dharma and .mok§a) .and . .§tngar~
(kama and artha);
11.1. The subha$ita·samgraha-s deal with different themes· and one is
often impressed by the polarity of views on the same subject: and paradoxes
expressed differently in the subhil#ta-s itiduded in them. · On the one hand we
are taught to live -a carefree and passionate life~ on the other self~control and
11
self..:abnegation
•... A ·characteristic feature of the subhz:z#ta-samgraha-s is na~~ly

whose works were lost 1 . Many of the San!:lkrit t'Oets would not have been known
to us even by name, if they and their stray verses would not be quoted in
subhCI~ita-samgraha-s. Also some parts of literary works of already known authors,
which otherwise would not have been known to us. are often preserved in subhl1\~ita~
scl1ngraha-s. We also find there sometimes some passages from well-known works
not preserved in the MSs. which are available to us 2 • Subh?l~ita-samgraha-s are also
important for chronological reasons, since they are mostly dated and in this way
provide information as to the date ad quem poets, named by them, lived (e.g., a
poet named in an anthology from the thirteenth century A.D. must have lived
before that date or be contemporaneous with the author of the anthology).
13.2 Subhi'l$ita-samgraha-s have a]so an enormous poetical and educative
value, even if they belong to a comparatively late period and even if the verses
quoted in them are anonymous, since they teach us what was considered as ri~ht
behaviour among culturPd ~people of India and as such constitute a code of good
conduct applied in ancient India ; tbev depict vividly the spirit of an age, the task
and ability durinJt various periods, country life. Jife in the village, different
occupations of men and women. the-ir habits and manners. activities, etc. some-
times better and with deeper insight than the quotations from kilvpa~s and epics.

the current wise sayings, but also excellent poetry : they are real gems. of
poetical expression with minute descriptions of everything that was worth noting
and describing ; they are like sparks and, on account of the terseness of their
expression and their striking, but easily comprehensive, imaginary they drive home
the ancient truths, which have become alm9st banal, with a fresh impact.
Subhi.i~ita-s included in the subhil.~ita-sarhgraha-s are: storehouses of information
written in beautiful language about the life of the common. people of India
between the eleventh and nineteen century. This information, easily available
in these collections can only be found ~here, since the other sources of Indian
literature describe rather the life of kings, BrahmaQ.a-s and nobles.
Contents of Subhli,ita-samgraha-s
We can assume that not all subha~ita-s included in the subhii?ita-
were originally put there by the compiler of the subhct~ita-samgraha,
particularly. if it is preserved in one MS only. It is known that the scribes
liked to add to the text wise sa:yings which were similar to those quoted before;
if, for instance, the original subhll~ita-samgraha quoted two or three verses dealing
with wealth, its good and bad sides, the scribes were likely to add other subhll~ita-s
from the floating . mass of oral tradition dealing with the same subject, since
many subhll~ita-s must have been known to him\

15. A large majority of verses included in the subhll§ita-samgraha-s are
anonymous hut often are ascribed to poets or poems, Usually these ascriptions
are reliable and as such are very useful for the reconstruction of the. critical
text of the said work ; particularly the reconstruction of non-uniform texts, such
as the Pural).a-s can he greatly facitita_ted by the use of texts preserved in the
subha:~ita-sarhgraha-s and specifically attributed to a given Purlil).a, the more so as
we usually can date and p)ace the texts of the subha?£ta-samgraha-s and thus know
in what form it was current in a certain time and, possibly, at a certain place. 2

found in any of the MSs. of that work they should also be taken into consider-
ation in the reconstruction of that work. as possibly forming part of it: they
could have been "lost" or purposely omitted from the original text by some
scribes. 1 We find. for instance, in the Subha$itaratnahara some verses attributed
to the Kautiliya-Arthasastra 2 ' which we do not find in any texts of this artha-
sastra : it is possible that they originally belonged to this work; since they are
written in the style and language of this treatise and are construed in its spirit 3 , or
are a variant 4 of another work: (i.e., the Manava-dharma~astra in a form very
different from the usually accepted text of this dharmasctstra 5 ).
17. The subhll$ita-samgraha-s do not give us always the names of the
authors of the individual verses; often they may only say that .. somebody" is
their author ; sometimes they say that the verse was taken from a specific work.
e.g., the Ma~kar:tdeya-purana ; and sometimes they ascribe a verse to a m:ythical
poet, e.g., to Vyasa, that does not mean necessarily that it was taken from the
Mahabharata ; and sometimes they give only the epithet or the by-name of the
poet. The ascription of authorship of a verse to an individual poet_or work is not
always reliable ; we very often notiCe that in one subha~ita-sam.g,'aha a given verse
is ascribed to one poet and jn another subha~ita-sarh&raha to another poet. Some
verses quoted in different subhf.l$ita-sariagraha~s are even sometimes attributed to
six different poets. Sometimes these poets are entirely different, but sometimes
only some letters of probably the same name were changed, e.g., Solloka or
Solhoka. or Sohloka, or Sohr:wka or Sonhoka and sometimes we have to 'wonder
whether the verse was, for instance, ascribed to SilhaQ.a or to Bilhal)a, or whether
Silhal).a was the same person as Bilhal).a.
18.
I
Sometimes also different scribes of the same work added different
ascriptions to the same verse ; therefore we find, for instance, that in one MS
of the same subhil~ita-samgraha 6 a verse is ascribed to one author, while in another
MS of the same anthology the verse is ascribed to another author.

19. With regard to ascriptions to works and not to individual poets,
some subha~ita-samgraha-s often mix up the best known works, e.g., the
Mab.abharata with the Ramayax)a, or the Manava-dharmasastra and even some-
times with the so·caHed CaQakya's sayings, thus proving that, particularly in these
cases, the compiler of the particular subhasita-sa»H!raha did not quote the verse
from the original but from his memory which, as so often in this case also, let him
down; he could have also been misled by tradition.
20.. Wrong ascriptions to different authors, mostly in mod~?rn subhct$ita-
sa:rngraha-s, are often due to the ea relessness of the editors. Sometimes the first
pada is identical in several sub;ha$ita-s while the next pa.da-s are not ; if the editor
did not take enough care to check the whole verse with the original he often made
mistakes in ascribing the part:icular·verse to the right poet or work. 1
21. Despite these shortcomings the ascriptions of vel'ses quoted in
subhas'ita-samgraha.,-s to different poets are of great value and we can assume with
a great degree of certainty that if a verse was ascribed in more than one subha~ita­
samgra.ha to a particular author 2 and if it was not ascribed in another subhct~ita­
samgraha to a different author, it was really composed by this poet.
Wise sayings in other works than Subha,ita.samgraha~s
22. Since Indian authors were very fond of quoting wise sayings and
moral teachings, they did not only cite them in the various anthologies, but also
have woven them into some of their literary works, in particular into the kath(l-
literature. Most of the collection of fables have been written in order to teach
young princes worldly wisdom~ the science of proper conduct (n'i.tiSastra) and are
therefore full of ,subha~ita-s. Also another branch of Sanskrit literature contains
innumerable subha~ita-s and sflkti-s but rather in the form of quotations from
other literary works tban.moral sayings. These are the works on poetics, rhetorics
and dramaturgy, the authors of which in order to illustrate the points of their
t,eacbings, rasa-s, etc. quoted verses from various poetical works of authors not
only known to us, but often unknown authors whose works became lost. The
Sabit:va-sastras and the A.lamkara-s can often be also considered as subhc:zsita-
samgraha-s composed of illustrative verses. Even some commentaries like the
Mababhaeya of Patanj.ali are storehouses of subha~ita-s.

Many such examples could be quoted, e.g., in the Subha~ira-r.atna-bhtH;UJitSilra.

ascribed tto the same author .in the Subha .. ~ita-ra.tna.-bh.a~u!rtgctra and :the Sarnga.dAara·vaddhati
w;e still are not certain whethet this verse was ;really composed.by the given author, because

from another with regard to the form of the text, the order of verses and textual
subject matter. The number of verses in these recensions amounts usually to 700
but sometimes even to 1006 verses/ but only 430 'Verses-giltha-s (musical stanzas) 2
appear in aH the recensions ; most of the remaining verses are probably inter-
polations, many of them by scribes who knowing the popularity of Hala's work,
added verses of the same theme which they knew by heart.
24.3. Hala was often identified with king Satavahana (Salivahana, or
Salavahana. etc.) ruling in Prati!;>tbana in the Asmaka country on the bank of
Goda.vari and husband of Lilavat1, the daughter of king Silamegha of Simhala
island 3• His work was written in Prakrit, or specifically in Mahara1?tri dialect 4
current in the MabarMtra, the land of Maratha-s 5, between the Vindbya mountai~s
and the Godavari river. 6 The Sattasai was possibly from the second century A.D.
but probably from the period between A D. 200 and 600. 7
24.4. Hala, by means of a few strokes, depicted the life and character of
the villagers of Mahrrrastra with all their virtues and vices, their family life, their
religious and social customs, including marriages and other ceremonies peculiar to
the various castes and. above all, their sex-life and sex-relations, often frankly and
sensuously, as well as the land on which they lived, with rivers, valleys, mountains,
vegetations and fauna.

24.5. The gatha-s, intended to be sung, contain poetry of the highest:
.type. They are written in poetical language, and not necessarily in the language
of the common people. Each gatha forms a unity in itself and only in some cases
two or three gatha-s are combined and form a song~~Not infrequently a gcUha forms
an epigram or
aphorism where a certain truth is expressed in few words·: very
seldom g(J.thiA-s contain well-rounded narrative verses from another poem or
drama. The verses, as Ha:la himself stated in the third verse of Sa.ttasai, were
compiled from different sources and probably onl:y the 430 verses common ·to all
recensions, formed the nucleus of the original collection; a part of these verses
were probably culled by H:da from different poems with the addition of a great
number of verses composed by himsel£. 1 Some of the commentators on the
Sattasai, of which they are fourteen from all over India, ascribed a great number
of verses to different authors who lived until the eighth century A. D. 2 ; Bhuvana-
pala's commentary on Sattasai alone 3 quoted 389 authors including, Ha1a
himself, but MSs. of the Sattasai differ from one another in aEcriptions of
different verses to different authors. 4 Tha popularity of Hala 's work 5 inspired in
the eleventh century Govardhana to imitate Hala's geztha-s in Sanskrit i'lrya
verses: he arranged them alphabetically; he called his work the Aryasaptasatl. 6
Although he wanted to throw into dark the fame of Ha:la by composing some 700
verses with erotic themes, his rendering is inferior in poetic skiU to Ha:la's ~mha.-s.
Biharlhrl (or Viharilal) composed also in Hindi his Sat'sai basing himself on
Ha:la 's work and Paramananda wrote his Spi.gara-saptasatika modelling it on
Biharilal's poem. On the model of Govardhana's Aryasapta§ati, Gopinatha

the Sattasai was no mere anthology, but a carefull collection o£ V\!I3es largely his own or re·
fashioned by himself-much as Burns refashioned some of his ina.terial-on tlfe basis of older
verses, and that in course of time by interpolation and change the collection lost much of its

it contains 1344 verses (692 +652), of which only 449 are common to bothrecensions

verses (all in gatha metre, including 5 introductory and 3 closing verses): the work
is divided into 95 vajja-s (Skt. vrajil-s or paddhati-s) according to the three
puru~ilrtha-s (dharma, artha and k?lma), as was implicitly confirmed by the
compiler (in gztthez 4): however only one third of the verses are gnomic and relate
to dharma and artha: the rest is erotic in nature, sometimes with a double meaning
even conferminous with pornography. The verses are not ascribed to indiv-idual
authors. The work is an antbologrpar excellence as is clearbr stated in verse 3 8 •

INTRODUCTION
2S.3. The date of the Vajja:Iagga is unknown but it must have been
composed not much later than Ha:la's Sattasai 1•
25.4. We find some common verses 9 in the Sattasai and the Vajjalagga 9
as . well as in newly discovered Prakrit subha§ita-samgraha, probably from the
fifth century A.D., the ChapaQ.Q.aya Gahao. 4 The Kuvalayama:Ia of Uddyotana-
suri (A.D. 778 or 779) 5 refers along with Ha:la (called Sa:hrhaQ.a) 6 and Palittaya
to Chappm)J:;taya who seems not to be an individual author, but a community of
outstanding poets also known by the name of Vidagdhas 7 :this was probably
group of 56 eminent poets (§atprajna) whose stray verses have survived in a
subha~ita-samstraha by the name of Setu, 8 compiled in the Vabrtaka age (5th
century). When this anthology lost its importance, some verses of it were
incorporated in Ha:la's Sattasai.
26.1. The C h a p a Q. I). a y a-g a: h a o ~(or the Giithakosa of ChapaQ.Qaya)
contains 164 gatha-s in Jaina Ma:hara~tri with some verses in Apabhrarhsa. The
original work was probably shorter and several verses were added later. This
anthology is not divided according to puru~CJrtha-s but some topics are grouped
together. None of the verses are ascribed to individual authors9.
Subha,ita-samgraha in Sanskrit
27.1. The first genuine Sanskrit subhez~ita-samgraha, probably from the
eleventh or twelfth century A.D. (1130) is the Vi d y a k a r a's S u b b a: ~ it a-
r a t n a - k o !? alo. A fragment of this subhct~ita-samgraha was published on the
1. Hala is mentioned in verse 468; someJayavallabha's verses are found in the Gauc)avaho
(cca .. A.D. 750) and in the Kavyaprahttda (cca A.D. 1100); therefore the dates between A.D.
750 and 1100 are the probable dates of the composition of this anthology.
2. The wording is not always identical.
3. According to J. Laber-76 verses ; according to M. V, Patwardhani--82 verses.
4. More common verses are in this work and in the Vajjalaggam as in the Sattasai.

basis of a fragmentary palm-lea£ MS in 1912 in the Bibl. Ind. (No. 1309) by E. W.
Thomas as the K a vi n d r a vac an as a mu cc ay a. F. W. Thomas wrote in
the preface to this work that "It is not very likely that a second MS will ever be
found to make good the deficiencies" : however the Subha!;iita-ratnakosa (which
incorporated the Kavindravacanasamuccaya) was edited on the basis of two MSs. :
a palm-leaf codex from the N gor monastery in Central Tibet, a comparatively
modern paper MS of Kbatmandu, as well as on the basis of F. W. Thomas' edition
of the Kavlndravacanasarnuccaya. The first MS. contains 1000 verses, the ]ater 1728
verses and the Kavindravacanasamuccaya 525 verses,
27.2. The Subhti:$itaratnako$a which contains 1739 subha~ita-s is
divided into fifty sections vraj:VlZ-s o£ which the first six are devoted to different
deities; the seventh deals with the sun, a lesser deity ; the eighth to thirteenth with
diffP.rent seasons ; the fourteenth to twenty-sixth with various aspects of love ;
the twenty-seventh to thirty-first with description of day and night ; the
remaining vrai:vf1-s deal with miscellaneous items. Very little space is devoted in
this subhlZ~ita-samgraha to niti. Most of the verses are descriptive subhll~ita-s.
The Subhar~itaratnako:;;a quotes 223 authors and works.
28. Another text, containing also a part of the Subha~itaratnako~a is an
imitation of this anthology ; it is caUed P r a s a n n a-s a: h i t y a.-r a· t n a k a r a

many verses of Bengiili poets, since both-
Sridharadasa and his father Vatudasa-were in the service of king Lak$mal)asena
of Bengal.
29.2. The Saduktikart).amrta is divided into 5 pravczha-s (streams) ; each
1'ravaha is subdivided into vici -s (waves) ; each vici contains five verses. Since
there are 476 pravaha-s there should be 2380 verses, but several verses were
omitted and therefore the actual number of verses in. this anthology amount to
2370 and the number of authors quoted to 485. Most of the verses are
descriptive subha#ta-s.
30.1. Also from the thirteenth centur-y: (A.D. 1258) dat.es the Saktimu-
ktetvali of Bhagadatta Jalhana (or Jahla:Q.a) 1• The author was. the son· of
Lak~midhara; he worked in Southern·India for the Ya:dava king K+~t:ia who came
to the throne in 1247. The anthology is divided into 133 paddhati-s and contains
2790 verses ; it quotes 240 authors and works ; among the latter there· are also
other subhCJ$ita-samgraha-s, such as the Saktiratnakara and the Saktisahasra.
30.2. The Suktimuktavali exists in two versions-a small and a large one.
The first sections of the anthology contain useful information about poets and
poi:!try; the others deal with happiness, charity; fate~ wickedness, wisdom,
separation, union, misfortune, love, service to the king, etc. Verses quoted in
this anthology are both ethical and descriptive.

lnxiil
ot Dlimodara, grandson of Ra:ghava, the Rajaguru of Hammirabhupati
of Sakam-
bhari in the year A;D. 1363. Some scholars drew attention to a prasasti (verses
2-6) where San'lgadhara was called the son of Damodara and the grandson of
Raghavadeva who lived at the court of Hammlra, the Cauva!).a (Chauhan) king of
Sakhabhari. If by this is meant Hammira who reigned between A.D. 1262 and
1301, whose fame was sung in the Hammira.;,kavya and who was great patron of
scholars, then the date of 1363 seems to 'be conceivable for his grandson\
31.2. The Sarngadahara-paddhadi is divided into 163 sections
(paddhati-s), today containing only 4689 ethical and descriptive verses ; originally
the anthology contained probably 6300 verses, since in verse 56 (2.44) the total
number of verses is given as amouting to 6300. The Sarngadhara-paddhati is unlike
other Sanskrit anthologies; it does not contain merely a section of verses about
poets, poetry, women and love, dharma, artha. kama, etc."\ but deals with different
subject matters which usually should not be i.ncluded in anthologies of "beautiful
verses" we find there,. in particular, practica~ advice ·such as about different kinds
of horses, gardening, omina and portenda, swords, etc.
31.3. H.D. Sharma and J.B. Chaudhuri 3 have analysed the authorities
quoted in this anthology. According to H.D. Sharma 282 authors and according
to ].B.·Chaudhuri 271 authors and 31 works are quoted there. Several verses have
:double authorship and two verses bave-Jnore than .double authorship. Sarngadhara,
who .himself was also a poet, but ofno.high standing, quoted often the names of
,poets and works; not seldom, however, he ~ttributed some verses to "somebody".
32. Almost identical with the-Sarngadhara-p.addhati is the B rh a cc ha:-
r n. g a d h a r a - p a d d h a t i (or Brhat-Sarngadhara-paddhati) 4; th.is anthology
can be cosidedred as an inflated version of the Sartigadbara-paddhati. It is divided
into 588 prakarava-s (of which 473 occur also .in the Sarngadbara-paddhati) .and
contains' 7586 verses, of which ten are.in Pra~it. It is a cqmparatively late work
(eighteenth century) since it contains extracts of the Asvadhati'"k~ya written by

subhi'J~ita-samgraha in which each parvan deals with one of the four puru~IJrtha-s 5 •
Accqrding to the editor of this anthology, the Suktiratnabara is "an ornament" to
the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series; this is not an exageration; it is very yaluable.
particularly due to the fact that it quotes authors and works not quoted in most
,of: the other anthologies, e.g., verses from Kau~ilya's Arthaslistra, Nitidvi~a~;ik:r,
the V~sa-subha~ita-sarhgraha, or such authors as Prataparudra, Ravigupta, etc. 6 •
. It. quotes 81 works and 57 aurhors. but the ascriptions are often wrong 7•

nidhi and the Saktiratnah~ta axe one·and the same work; of which the Suktiratna-
h1ira (but not in its printed text) is original, while the Subha~itasudhanidhi is
either a copy of the Saktiratnah~ta with various additions and omissions or
another .version of the same text 1 • Both works are front the first half of the four-
teenth century 2 and its author may well be Sa:yal).a, since it is unlikely that Surya

34.2. The arrangement of the two anthologies is ' identical ; both are
divided into four parvan-s each dealing with dharma, artha. kama, ~nci mok§a ,and
parvan into paddhati-s ; the paddhati-s ar~ almost identical (i.e., their titles
arid contents, although tbe order of the verses is different) a.nd. both include. with
some. exceptions., the same subhct$ita-s. Particularly the .. contents of the two

lNTRODUCTION
this anthology, in the form in which it is available to-day, could not have been
compiled earlier than the 15th century 1• This is an extensive anthology on a large
variety of topics usually found in most Sanskrit anthologies. lt contains 3527
verses, both of ethical and descriptive character. The anthology is divided into
101 paddhati-s. According to the analysis made by P. Peterson it quotes some
360 poets 2 • Tn addition to stray verses, Valla bhadeva quoted parts of different
works, such as Minikha's Srikal)thacarita, Sambhu's RajendrakariJ.apura and
others.
..,
38.2, It was believed that with this subhasita-saml[raha, the Subh1lsitlivali
of SriT1ara is associated. However, it was pr~ved . that this antbol;_gy is
another text of the Sabha~itavali of Vallabhadeva. 8 Srivara lived in the latter
part of the 15th century; he was the disciple of Jonarllja who .continued
K~:!lhaQ.a's Rajatarangit).L Sriv~ra himself also wrote a Rajataranginl in continua-
tion of the one composed by his teacher Jonaraja.
39. From the end of the 15th and the first half of the 16th century dates
the P a d y I v a I i of R a p a G o s v a m i n, son of Kumilra and the disciple of
C~itanya, the founder of Bengal Vai~I)avism, teacher and exponent of its doctrines 4•
The Padyavali is rath~r a devotional work than a subha~ita-samgraha as far as
its contents are concerned ; it quotes also other poetical devotional works, such
as 32 stotra-s, among which is also the Ujjvala-nilamal)i: it contains 387 verses
ascribed to 129 authors, as well as to Rupa Gosvamin himself. Most of the
verses, due to their devotional character, were usually not quoted in other
anthologies with the exception of Harikavi' s Subha~itahara:vali, an anthology from
the middle of the 17th century which borrowed 36 verses from Rupa Gosvamin's
work 5 • Rapa Gosvamin quoted also other earlier non-Vi!,li)Uite authors
and unscrupulously changed sometimes the wording to make them sound
Vi~uuite.
1. Cf. M. Wint:ernitz. HSL HI. 1 (op. cit.r: p. 179 sqq. If we accept that date, then
the argu.,•nt adduced by S. N. Dasgupta and S. K. De in HSL (p. 414) that Jvlhaoa's S:a1ui~
muktilvalf based his anthology on the Subhn.~itavalf of Vallabhadeva must be wrong,

Also mention is made of a SubhMituvali of Acu;rya Sakalabrti, a Jnin: the anthology
is said to be written in smhvat 1938 (A.D. 18f10) at s'raval)a Belogo]a (DC .. XX, 12!39).

40. Probably from the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th
century dates the anonymous Sub ha ~ i t a-m u k t 11 v a 1 1 1 ; it must have been
cornpiled before 1623, sine~ one of the MSs. is dated samvat 1680 (A.D. 1623) 2 •
The anthology is divided into 32 muQUtmat~-i-s (ornaments of pearls) and contains
624 verses including the appendices. The verses are both ethical and descriptive.
The anthology is quite important since it contains many sayings not quoted in
other subha~ita-samgraha-s ; it was, however, possible to identify a great number
of its verses 3 •
41. Most of the other subhcz~ita-sarhgraha-s were compiled in the 17th
to 19th centuries. Worth noting are in particulars two anthologies compiled
by Harihara and/or Haravall; the first ~s the Snktimuktavali and the second the
Subha~itaMrlivaiJ. They were not written by the same person.
41.1. The S a k t i m u k t a v a 1 i of H a r i h a r a was written by a
Mithila Brahmin in the first half of the 17th century. This anthology was
published twice: in 1889 (s.:.:cond ed. in '1910) in the KM Series No. 86 and in 1949
by Ramanntha Jhrr in tbe Newspapers and Publications Ltd, Patna, respectively.
The latter edition is a critical edition ; it is based on 5 MSs. and contains 634
verses. Unlike other subha~ita-sam&raha-s its verses are not subha~ita-s composed
by different authors but they are mostly composed by Harihara himself ; on1y
very few are known subha~ita-s belonging to the floating mass of oral tradition.
The wmk is divided into 12 prakara'l')a-s which deal with gods and goddesses, up-
bringing of a child, advice to the young, F>taying abroad, eulogy of the king and
treatment of royalty, r(ljaniti, six seasons, erotics, and nllyaka-s, miscellanea and
calm of mind. Being a one man subhll~ita-samgraha, this work stands nearer to
individual collections of subha~ita-s, such as Bbartrhari's Satakas, than the
subhtJ~ita-samgraha-s described above.

No. 75 of 1871·72. The edition contains nn Introduction, the text, five appendices, of which
the fourth is a copy of a. short hav.va·work entitled Navaratna ; it must have been a very
popular poem, since it was also well·known in Ce.ylon. (Cf. H. Bechert, Sanskrit-Texte aus

41.2. The Subbii$.itahitrlvali or Sri Harika.vil is an
anthology of 2091 ethical amldescriptive verses par excellence. ·though it contains
also some excellent verses· composed. by Harikavi himself. 2 Harikavi, the compiler
ofithis anthology was the son of Narii-yal)a, ori~inaUy a Deceani Brahman who
lived first in Surat and then at the court of king Sambhaji ; he composed his work
in. the second half .of the 17tl;t century. ; it is unlikely that he was contemporary to
Akbar (1556-1605) :or identical with Akbariya K~lidasa. 8 The work was UO!..;.
fortunately never published yet though it is one of the best and most interesting
S,ubha~ita-samgraha-s. It contains numerous. ascriptions to different _poets of

Several verses of this anthology were ·~quoted in the edition of Bhartrhari's
epigrams published by D.D. Kosambi and in the Subha~itaratnako$a edition. In
this anthology the author underlines that men lose all interest .in life without

IJtllnY of which are. ascribed to different authors and works tllO in number)
including Mani.tl'fmJ himself. Th~ anthology has a lacuna bztween verses .190 and
204, and 1454 and 1496. In the Bbandarkar Or. Res. Institute there i~ ~ls~another
MS containing the same text, viz .. MS 52.7 of 1887-91, of :which the .first three
folia are lost : ends at fol. 98a. Many of the subha~ita-s quoted in this anthology
are also quoted in the D. D. Kosairnbi's edttion of Bhartrhari's epigrams and in the
Sul,hl~itaratnako$a edition. The imtholo~y was compiled-iri the. second. half of
the 17th century. Mm:tirama is probably identical with Mal).irllma Dik~ita, the
author of the Spi:garasanjlvani who was the protege of Maharaja Anup Stnghji

man of letters a~d it is unlikely that he himself was its . author ; if . so, he was
certainly helped by some pat)4its: . The anthology contains· 882 mostly ethica'l
v:erses and is divided into three sections ; the first (194 verses) contains subh~·§it·a:..s
quoted from several well-known authors ; the-second (630 verses) deals mostly
with artha and contains quotations from the Ki!mandaktya Nltisaia, the ·Matsya~

51. The gnomic and didactic Sanskrit poetry is also closely connected
with anthologies. for the latter are collections of stray gnomic verses composed by
different poets and culled from different sources. The difference lies in the principle
that anthologies are coJlecti~ns of verses composed by d i f f e r e n t authors,
while the gnomic and didactic poems are collections of verses composed by on e
author only. However, that is not always so in Sanskrit literature. Collections
of · gnomic and didactic ve.rses, presumably written by a single author and
attributed to him, in general parlance, need not necessarily be composed by
this author ; they were usually in majorem gloria.m only attributed to one
author, while they were borrowed from the floating mass of oral tradition. That
is particular the case of the two main works of gnomic and didactic literature-
collections of verses attributed to C a IJ. a k y a and B b a r t r h a r j. The
latter accepted the old division of subject matter into the four puru$artha-s :
dharma, artha, kama and mok~a which were regrouped in the collections of
e~igrams attributed to him into ·three sataka-s : niti (dealing with artha and
dharma), sri~gara (dealing witb kama) and vairagya (dealing with mok$a and
dharma).
52. The Sanskrit subhil§ita~Hterature as well as the didactic and gnomic
poetry are very extensive. Both do not contain only straight sententious sayings
and didactic verses, but also allegories (anyokti-s) and satiric verses in which the
authors either benevolently or harshly and sarcastically ridiculed men and their
behaviour :. the didactic literature is also closely connected with devotional and
even erotic literature. Highly sensuou~ pictorial effects, authenticated by a deep
sincerity of ecstatic emotion were often blended into one and thus helped to
create poems full of erotic mysticism, devout yet sensuous. In India worldly
wisdom, religious devotion and sensual love (kama as well as srngi.lra) are often
intermingled: the early division of aphorisms and epigrams on worldly wisdom into
those dealing with dharma, niti, kCJma (srngara) and mok~a had made a great
impression on Sanskrit literature and Srngara by its piquancy had added further
flavour to the entire Sanskrit literature, including even the devotional-literature.
Therefore, to draw a demarcation line between these types of Indian literature is
]rnpossible. It might be therefore correct to mention among tbe subha~ita­
]:i.te:rature not only the didactic and gnomic poetry hut also some lyric, erotic and
devotional poems.
53. As stated above the best representatives of the gnomic and didactic
poetry are the sayings attributed to Ca:l)ak:ya and the epigrams attributed to
Bhartrhari. Although a large group of verses attributed to Bhartrhari were
probably composed by the latter, it is Qot certain wheth~r the same can be saidctiv
INtRODUCTION
about the sayings attributed to CiQ.akya. · There are 2235 sayings attributed to
the latter and 852 epigrams attributed to Bhartrhari and it is impossible to believe
that one person could have been the author of 2235 or 852 sayings, respectively.
Although it is impossible to ascertain the authorship of these sayings to any. of
these authors, we must consider most of the sayings as being anonymous a.nd
authorless and belonging to the floating mass of oral Indian tradition, extremely
valuable for appreciating and understanding the wisdom of the Hindas and eo ipso
for the present Mahilsubhll~ita-.sa?ftgraha.. The numerous sayings, epigrams and
aphorisliis ascribed to C~~akya and Bhartrhari are now easily accessible since all
the sayings attributed to these authors were collected and critically edited. 1
54. Bhartrhari's Sataka-traya has found many imitators ; some of them
have written more ornate stray gnomic verses in kav.va-style but never attained
the bight of Bhart:rhari's poetry.

Collections of Jainistic and Buddhistic Gnomic and Didactic stray verses
56.
The Jainistic gnomic and didactic literature is quite extensive.
56.1.. A m it a g a t i, in addition to the Subhl'f~ita-ratna-samdoha
wrote also the Y o g a sa: r a, a didactic poem in .Sloka-s containing mostly
moral Jainistic instructions (m 9 chapters) ; an ethical poem, the D v a t r i ri1-
s a t i k a ; and a direct attack on Brahmanism-the D h a r m a p a r I k ~ a.
56.2. He m a c a n d r a,
basing himself possibly on Amitagati's
Subbll$itasamdoha, wrote in A. D. 1236 the Y o g a s 11 s t r a (the first four
chapters) which contains didactic teachings. 1
56.3. Also J in ad at t a Sari (A. D. 1075-1154) wrote three
didactic Jainistic poems, namely, the U p a d e ti a r a sa y a n a-R it s a, the
K a I a s v a r u p a k u 1 a k a m and the C a c c a r i.
56.4. At the end of the 13th century S o m a p r a b h a (or Soma-
prabbl:i-acarya, or -Suri), pupil of Vijayasiri1ha wrote the K u m ~ r a p i I a-
P r a t i b o d h a, a didactic poem and collection of tales in Prrrkrit, Sanskrit
and Apabhrarhsa ; it deals with· the five Jainist commandments and other pre-
scribed duties. Among others, be was also the author of the S IJ k t i m u k t a-
v a 1 1 or S i n d u r a p r a k it r a, a collection of 99 popular wise sayings
and moral duties appropriate for Jainas and praising Jainas ; this work was
very popular and many sayings were, and still are, known by heart by many
men and women of the Jainistic community. 2
56.5. Other Jainistic didactic poems were written later, e.g., the
a-v a i r a: g y a-t a r a t\ g i Q. I by another S o m a p r a b h a, being

the behaviour of good and bad persons ; the verses are written in anu§tubh-s ; the
collection is divided into 5 headings. The poem dates from the first half of the
19th century. The MS. of which the ficst folia are missing, was published by
S. Ritti.l
59.2. B ha 11 at a' s S at a k a (B ha 11 a ~ a ~ at a k a), a poem
containing 108 stray didactic and descriptive verses written in satirical tone, often
ridiculing undiscrirninating patrons ; composed in a variety of metres. 2 Not all
verses were composed by Bhallata himself, since we find among them some verses
written probably by Anandavardhana, a poet from Ka§mir. Bhallata himself was
also a Kasmiri poet who lived at the time of kin~ Sal'lkaravarman (883-902). Many
of Bhallata's verses were quoted in subhc:t~ita-sanigraha-s and works on almi1.kiira-s. 3
59.3. B h a v a b h IT t i' s G u 1). a r a t n a, a short poem of 13 stray
verses in a 'variety of metres attributed, ·probably wrongly, to the great poet
Bhavabbuti 4 ; also popular in Ceylon ; most of the verses nre culled from other
poems, such as the Hitopadesa, (verses 3, 8,. 12), the Pa:ncatantra (verses 5 . 9), the
so-called CaQakya'!? sayings (verses 6, 11), the Skanda-puraiJa (verse 7) and the
Malatimadhava (verse 1) ; one verse also occurs in the Dp:;tantn~ataka (verse 13).
Very few verses in the Gul).aratna were not borrowed from known sourceR.
Probably this collection of stray verses was ascribed to Bhavabhuti becuuse its
first verse is the first (in some editions the second) introductory verse of Bhava-
bho:ti's Malatimadbava. Only verses 2, 4, and 10 of the Gul).nratna do not appear
in other primary sources of which verse 5 was probably very popular in India in
early times since it also appears in the literature of Tibet : in Vararuci's Satagatha
(4) (Mchog sred, Tshigs-su bcad-pa brgya-pa) included in the Tibetan Tanjur, and
also in the She-rab Dong-bu (150) and the Subha~ita ratna-nidhi (4, 14).
59.4. B h o j a' s C a: r u c a r y a:, a collection of 135 stray verses,

59.5. D a k ~ in a: m Q r t i' s L o k o k t i m u k t a: v a It, a collection
of 94 devotional verses and wise sayings, composed in a variety of metres and
divided into six paddhati-s ; each verse is composed of two parts ~ in the first part
a truth is proclaimed and the second contains an argumentation or corroboration
reinforcing the truth or an example illustrating it. Dak~ii).amurti lived probably
between A. D. 1450 and 1600. 1
59.6. Ghat a k a r p a r a's Nit is :a r a, a collection of 21 stray
verses written in a variety of metres ; the poem is written in the form of a dialogue
between a hog and a lion and contains rn~stly wise sayings culled from other
poems, particularly from the Hitopadesa. 2 Gba.takarpara is also the author of a
collection of 23 stray verses, called rhe G h a t a k a r p a r a-k El: v y a (also
called Yam a k a-ka v y a); this poem deals mostly with the pangs of separation
of a love-stricken lc;dy who speaks to the clouds and asks them to transmit her
massage to her husband ; it is a di2ta-kcwya. 3 When Gatakarpara lived is not
known. By tradition, he was considered as one of the nine jewels at the court of
Vikramaditya, but it is not certain whether he was the author of both of them-
the N'itisara and the kllvya, nor whether he was one of the nine jewels at the
court of Vikramaditya. The Ghatakarpara-kavya was also sometimes ascribed to
Kalidasa.

could be added to this list but the first is a collection of ver.5es attributed to
Ma:yura, culled from poems of Ma:yilra~ and subha§ita-samgra:ha-s ; the second is a
l:yric poem ; the third is a devotional and philosophical treaty ; and the fo'Uirth is
an erotic and devotional poem.
62. Also another type of poetry can be added to the didactic literature,
i.e. collections of riddles. Indian riddles belong also to the muktaka literature
since they were composed in "detached" verses, so that each verse formed an
entity by itself. They were very popular in India, the more so as Indian poets
made always strenuous efforts to express nothing in a straight-forward manner
and always desired to conceal as much as possible or to express an idea in a round
about way (Dhvanyi'Iloka 4.5). Consequently riddles were considered as one of
the 64 arts (kalfl-s).
We find riddles, theological riddles (brahmodya-s), already in the Veda-s,
Brahmm).a-s, Aranyaka-s, Srautasatra-s, etc. They formed there an essential part
of religious ceremonies (e.g., Rgveda 1.164: 1.95.4 : 8.29 ; Atharvaveda 9.9 ;
Virjasaneyi-sa'Q'lhita: 23.9, 10 ; 47-R ; 61-2 : Taittiriya~sa:q1hita 2. 5. 8. 3 ; 7. 4. 18 ;
Satapatha bra:hmana 4.6.9.20; 6.2.5; 11.4.1.2 ; 5.3.1 : 6.25; 13.2.6.9 sqq. ; 5.2.12
sqq. ; 14.6.8.1: Aitareya~bi~hrna:r:m 5.25; Kau~itaki-brahmana 27.4; Taittirlya-
briihmal).a 2.5.83 ; Brhad-aral)yaka-upanj~ad 3.8.1 : Apastampa~srautasiltra 20.19 ;
Asval~yana-srautasutra 10.9.1-3: 8.13.13-4; Ka:tyayana-srautasatra 10.9.1-3;
20.7.11; 124.20 ; L~tyayana~srautasmra 9.10.9; Sankhayana~srautasutra 16.4-6.13;
37.1 sqq. ; Vaitlina-sutra 37.1, 38.5 sqq.). We find also riddles in the epics (e.g.,
Mabiibbarata 1.77-83 : 33.12-3), in the katha-Htearture (e.g., Kathasaritsagara
5.1.65 ; 155 A ; 72. 163 D), in the Buddhist literature (e.g., Samyutta 10.12;
Alavaka-siltta 1.10 ; Suciloma-siltta 2.5 : Devata-samyutta 1.6.4. Jataka-s 17, 84,
135,. 245, 257, 301, 319, 401, 414, 453, 473, 477. 483, 515, 516, 518. 521, 522, 530,
533, 539, 544, 545, 546; Puggalapannatti IV: H. 1.4.25 sqq. ; Culavagga 4.14.14-6;
Milindapailha 7, etc.), in the Jaina literature (e.g., Bhaivadeva Sari's Parsvanatha-
caritra 3.105, Hemavijaya's Katbaratnakara 8.192.6, 9.203.8-10, etc.) and others.
Riddles were defined in the almnkiJra-s and particularly in Danc;lin's Kavylidarsa
(3.98-123) and divided there into 16 categories. However these categories were
soon forgotten. Indian riddles took the form of general puzzles, enigmas, charades,
conundrums, logogriphs. anagrams. epigrams, and even mathematical, grammatical,
1. KM. XII. 61-191; divided into 40 paddhati·s ; from the 14th century ; wme verses
are quoted in subflrtljita-s.athgraha-s, such as SP, VS and JS; it deals with the story of how
Siva went about as a mendicant and how his appearance in the street influenced the women
of the town.

Sa.tiric Poems with Didactic str.ay venes
63. To this type of literature belong also the satiric and didactic poems,
particularly of K:;;emendra,. 4 one of the most prolific poets of India. He lived in
Kasmir in the eleventh century (probably from 1010 to 1070}. His works, not all
of which are preserved to our days, may be divided into 5 groups : (1) didactic
works; (2) satirical and didactic works; (3) poetical works: (4) treaties on
poetics and metrics ; and (5) miscellanea.
64. Pure didactic works full of wise sayings are the Cilrucary~-sataka
and the Caturvarga-sarhgraha ; partly also the Kavika:r;tthiTbharal).a. The satirical
and didactic works are the Kalavila:sa, the Darpadalana, the Desopadesa, the
Narmama:la:, the Sevyasevakopadesa and the Samayamiitrka.

wise saying and the second an illustration of the truth proclaimed before, mostly
drawn from tbe Pu.ral}.a-s or epics. Tbis work must have b~en very popular in
India, since very often verses of the Carucarya are included in subhet#ta-samgraha-s,
such as the Subha$itaharavali, which quotes one-fifth of the work, 1 and in the
Nuisatilgraha, and since the NI timanjarl of Dya. Dviveda of the 15th century
was used as model for that work. At least it was greatly influenced by the
Carucaryli. 2

64.2. The C a t u r v a r g a-s a rh g r a h a 3 is one of the poorest works
of K~emendra : it contains 111 stray verses divided into 4 kchapters (pariccheda-s)
of 27, 25, 25 and 29 verses, respectively, they deals with dharma, artha, kama and
mok~a; the work is supposed to be a practical handbook of morals written in a
variety of metres ; it is however prosaic and dull. The ketma-pariccheda,
stylistically and thematically more original, contains mostly descriptive verses.

64.3. The K a vi k a l) t ha b h a r a l) a (A necklace for poets) 4 is a
poem of only 55 vE-rses divided into 5 chapters (sandhi-s) of 24, 23, 3, 2 and
3 verses, respectively. It is a short treatise on the making of the poet.
Particularly the second sandhi is dtdactic, for it lays down one hundred pieces
of advice for poets.
64.4. K$emendra, did not construe his satiric and didactic works in the
form of coUections of stray verses : he usually divided them into chapters of
which each dealt with a specific subject ; then he illustrated the subjects by witty
storief• In these poems K:?emendra has shown an excellent knowledge of the
society and experience of life; he depicted the sodety with sarcasm ; his remarks,
sometimes expressed tediously, were concerned with topics rarely described by
other poets. Perhaps the best of his satiric and didactic works is the

46, 33, 26, 29, 73 and 43 arya-verses, respectiv.ely, in which the le~endary, Mu1adeV'a 2
discu&ses with his young disciple, Candragupta various forms of cheating, greed,
pitiable condition .of those in love, viles of women, deceitful character of harlots,
the unscrupulousness of kayastha-.~. pride and arrogance of drunkards, bards,
dancers, actors, singers, goldsmiths and finally terminates his satire with good
advice to young men how to avoid falling into evil ways;: K!;lemendra illustrates bis
remarks by amusing tales. In particular in this work, K$emendra has shown his
mastery in the use of Sanskrit language and his satire is lively and effective.
64.5. Also one of K$emendra's good satiric and.didactic works is the
D a r p a d a 1 a n a (Smashing of Pride) 3 ; it is divided into seven chapters
(vicara-s) of 82, 113, 154, 75, 45, 54 and 73 verses, respectively, written in a variety
of metres. It is more a didactic than a satiric poem. Each chapter begins with
, a series of wise sayings illustrated by means of witty stories in which pride is the
main subject, for the Darpadalana is a diatribe against pride, due to hi~h birth,
wealth, knowledge, beauty, heroism, charity, or asceticism.
64.6 .. The Des o p a de ~a,'' one of the earliest works of K!,)emendra,
is a poem divided ioto eight cantos ( uradesa-s) o£ 24. 36, 48, 34. 2s. 45. 3 and s2
verses, respeCtively, composed in a variety of metres/• The poem is a satirical work,
sometimes vulgar ; it is full of wise sayings ; it ridicules the cheat, the miser. tbe

64.7. The N a r: m a m 111 1 1 is akin to the Desopadesa and somewhat
comJ)lementary thereof ; the satire is less biting and severe, and the poem seldom
contains wise sayings ; it is rather a narrative satire than a didactic .satire. The
Narmamala is divided into three parihasa-s (jokes) of 148, 145 and 114 verses,
respectively, largely in sloka-metre. In this work . K~emendra ridiculed the
administration and in particular the kayastha-s whom he mocks m their
public and private life. including their wins, the tax-collectors, the physicians;
the astrologers, etc.
64.8· Also t9 this group of poems of K~ernendra belongs the
S e v y a se v a k o p a de § a 2 (Instruction for the Servant and the Served) ; it
is a short poem of 61 verses written. in a variety of metres containing shrewd
reflection on the relation of master and servant with the didac.tic motive to

65.2. In the Kuttantmata. Mlllatt-a prostitute fro-m V!ItiiQast addressed
herself to a procuress,. V'ikar~lii for instruction bow to attract lovers. The procuress
gave b~r shrewd lessons how to ensnare a lover (in particular CintilmaQi, son of a
high official) and to win man's love and fortune. Many of her advices are dida.ctic
stray verses illustrated by amusing, cunning love tales. • The work ends with the
explanation of the reason why the poem was written: in order to help people from·
being cheated by wicked women. rogues and procuresses. The work was thus
intended to be a didactic work ba!lled on the dose s.tud:v of the science contained
in the Kltmasatra. 1 Erotic tendency prevails in this work, but there is no didactic
moralizing, nor any squeamish language in describing women and their ways ; it
is a farcical sketch in which moral depravitv is openly and amusingly depicted by
the author, not with approval. but with the object of making it look ludicrous•
and to quote profound thoughts in the form of subhi2$ita-s of epigrammatic
tendency often with plenty of humour and kindly wit. D~modaragupta painted
vividly and benignantly rogues and gullible fools and rather than creating a biting
satire, created a benevolent comedy in which be depicted delicate problems and
exposed human weaknesses and faults with not too toothless irony. He showed
good taste and restraint, so that his work can be considered as an elegant piece of
poetry of considerable interest and unique in its style and sort, 8 as such, it was
considered in classical and mediaeval India : the frequent quotations from
Damodaragupta's work in subh?t?ita-savngraha-s and works ~on alam&ara-s
prove this.
66. On the other hand K ~ e ni end r a' s Sa may a mat f k I, an
imitation of Diimodaragupta's Kuttanlmata, does not have the same merits.
K$emendra did not show in his work any poetical talent or elegance. His work
is often vulgar: it is not an amusing comedy. but an acrid. cheap satire, often
in bad taste. The Samayam:Itrka: is a·poem in 8 chapters (samaya-s) of 52, 108.
37, 134. 90, 36, 56 and 129 verses, respectively, c:Jmposed .mostly in ~loka- and

taught a young prostitute Kalavatl how to achieve mastery in her new profession :
it is illustrated bv didactic stray sayings and amusing stories. Tbe bawd's witty
instructions aid Kalavati to cheat a young fool and his stupid parents. K~emendra,
as was so usual to him, had proved to be an expert in Ka:masmra-s and a keen
observer of life in Kasmir which he described with true reatism and biting
sarcasm.
67. The latter two texts are on the borderline between the. didactic and
gnomic literature and the erotic lierature; poems belonging to the latter branches
of Sanskrit literature can very often be also included among collections of stray

Sanskrit origin, mostly ethical ''subha~ita-s, became also known in countries
West of India.

70. In the ninth, tenth and eleventh centuries A.D. some of the best
known works in India, not necessarily of Buddhist charact~r, were translated
into Tibetan and were included in the Tanjur. In this way some Sanskrit
gnomic poems which became lost in India were preserved in Tibet.
71.1. The Tibetans had a speciallikin~ for the gnomic (nui) literature
and in particular for collections of moral and ethical sayings. Thus, one of the
best known Indian collections of gnomic verses, the so-called Cat~akya's sayings,
and in particular the CaQ.akya-raja-niti-s~stra version. was preserved in Tibetan
through a translation made in the tenth or eleventh century A.D.
71.2. Since the first studies were made in the Tibetan Tanjur by A.
Csoma de Koros in the first half of the nineteenth century, we know that eight
works, containing collections of subhCZ§ita-s, were included in the Tanjur. These
works are as follows 1 :

The text is divided into 8 adhyaya·s which contain respectively 23, 30, 31,
17, 26, 23, 31 and 72. wise sayings. This text must have been well known in
Tibet and probably was used by other Tibetan compilers of subha~ita-samgraha-s,
sine~ we find many of the same wise sayings also in the She-rab-dong-bu and the
Subh!I~ita-ratna-nidhi.
71.5. The text of the N l t i s a s t r a of M a s u r a k ~ a was com-
pletely unknown in India untill962. Only then was it for the first time edited
in Tibetan with a retranslation into Sanskrit and a translation into English by
Sunitikumar Pathak, 1
71.6. Masurak!_;a is an unknown author; he is mentioned only once in
Vallabhadeva's Subhli!}itavali as the author of verse 2935 which is however a
verse from the Pancatantra 2 ; Masurak~a (or Masurak~a) mentioned in the Tanjur
is probably another person and was probably the compiler of a subha~ita-samgraha
which must have been popular in India in the tenth or eleventh century A. D. 8
72. In addition to the gnomic ( niti) works preser~ed in the Tanj:ur we
find also two other Tibetan subhi2§ta-sa:7igraha-s. undoubtedly at least in its
greater part, of Sanskrit origin, viz., the She-rab dong-bu and the Subha~ita­
ratna-nidhi.

M. Winternitz 1
considered that it was not likely that this anthology was the work of Na:garjuna,
while Campbell tried to prove that it was compiled or written by Nag:rrjuna
himself; if we accept Campbell's theory than the She-rab dong-bu was composed
in the first century B. C. W .L. Camp bell was of the opinion that this anthology
was a metrical translation from Sanskrit of an ethical work. It seems, however,
that She-rab dong-bu was compiled in the form known to us sometimes in the
eleventh century A.D. when most Sanskrit works were translated into Tibetan
and included in the Tanjur.
73.1.1. The She-rab dong-bu is a well-known work in Tibet. though it
was more likely better known by the educated classes by name only. It was
largely quoted by Tibetan authors. W. L. Campbell co:r.sidered that later
writers borrowed many sentiments and sometimes entire lines, inserting them
in their own compositions. He particularly thought that PatJ.dit Sakya had
done so when preparing his Subhasita ratna-nidhi. It is difficult to subscribe
to this statement since it was possible to identify only three subha~ita-s which
occur in both works 2 and two of them are CaQakya's wise sayings; their common
source was probably the Canakya-niti-sastra prevalent in Tibet.
73.1.2. The She-rab dong-bu was first edited by Rai Bahadur Sarat
Chandra Da~ 3 and then by W. L. Carnpbell 4 who gave on the right-hand side the
Tibetan text and on the left-hand side the English translation.
73.1 .3. The work deals mostly with ethics and general wisdom ; it
contains only few Buddhistic truths (e.g. 61, 100) and even in these places some
Sanskrit words could have been changed by the translator in order to fit the text
·with his own faith ; such a procedure was also extensively applied in the Tibetan
Ca-Q.akya-nitH:rstra. She-rab dong-bu followed the patten of Sanskrit antholo-
gies, as far as their contents were concerned and included, similarly as the n::ain
Samkrit: subhll~ita-samgraha-s did, wise sayings from the katha- workss and from
the floating mass of oral tradition.

73.2. The S u b h a: ~ i t a~r a t n a-n i d h i is also a subhet~ita-sam­
graha in Tibetan : it contains 457 wise sayings and is divided into 7 chapters
dealing with the wise, the prominent people, tbe excellent and the fools, wrong
behaviour, normal behaviour, improper behaviour, duties of men and religious
doctrines. The wise sayings included in this anthology are not always translations
from Sanskrit but, perhaps with the exception of the last chapter, were influenced
by Sanskrit sayings. Also the arrangement and the division of this anthology into
the seven chapters mentioned above show Indian influences. 1 This anthology
contains however one noticeable characteristic : it deals to a negligible extent
with women, a subject dealt extensively in Sanskrit subhliSita-sarhgraha-s. It
contains only isolated sayings with Buddhist leanings.

It was partly published in 1855-56 with an English traslation by Csoma de

of this work was translated into French in 1858 by Ph. E. Foucaux; it contains
a selection of 134 subhil~ita-s. 12 of these subhli§ita-s were translated into German
in 1860 and published in the Illustrzrten Revalschen Almanach. A Schi.efner
published critically {with notes) 33 of subhil§ita-s'and included them in the first
edition only ot Bohtlingk's Indische Spruche in 1863-1865. Also G. Huth in his
History of Tibet Hor chos byung, published and translated 19 subha.~·ita-s. The
whole text with a German translation was published in 1925 by W. L. Campbell
(who also published and translated the She-rab dong-bu) in the Ost-Asiatische
. Zeitung, N. F. 2 (pp. 31-65 and 159-185). The best critical edition (of the
T 1 betan and Mongolian texts) with an English translation was published by

the degree of Doctor of Phliosophy in the United States and was produced by

published in China in 1959 in Cb'eng-tu and another one in Lan-chou and a
selection of 212 subha~ita-s in Chinese translation also in 1958. 1
73.2 2. There are ma11y stories about the life of Pai.J.o:lit Saskya 2 • We
know that .he made a long trip to China and reside:! in Middle Tibet (U Ts·ang)
in the Saskya monastery in the province of Ts'ang ''one hundred days distant"
from Tasbi Lhun-po. According to the introduction and the colophon, the
Subba~ita-ratna-nidbi was first compiled by Na:ga:rjuna but was written and edited
by the Pa:~;tdita Saskya. Sometimes, in the beginning of the thirteenth century
A.D., according to the legend, the Subha~ita-ratna-nidhi was brought by Pandit
Saskya from China (sic f) but was lost by him when a boat overturned on a river.
However,. when Pal)Qit Saskya returned to his monastery he found it in the
library 3 •
73.2.3. Tibetan scholars consider that the Subhil~ita-ratna-nidhi, known
there as Sa-skya legs-bead (in Lhassan : Sak:ya Leg~he), was not a work of one
person but a compilation made by three scholars. They base this theory on the
introduction where it is stated that the author of the Subha~ita-ratna-nidhi took
the best from various works of his predessessors. This argument is not convincing,
since Sanskrit subhll~ita-samgraha-s had often such an introduction and fat
instance all the texts of the. CaiJ.akya~niti-sastra version begin with a similar
introductory stanza.

blocs were prepared and are preserved, in Cbagban aghule-yin sume of
the Cbaqar kobege tU Chaghan-i qosighan, the white mountain monastery of the
white-bordered flag of Tsakhar. 1 This text is also combined with a commentary
entitled Subha~idi-yin tayilburi chindamani-yin tulkigilr keme!tdekii ; the latter is
the revised version of the Tibetan commentary of Rin chen bzan-po. This
verf:ion was published in book form in Kalgan sometimes between 1930 and 1950
and in Ulaanbastar in Cyrillic script, as well as in Mukden in Mongolian script.
There e_xist also a West Mongolian (K~lrimk) translation of the work. 2 .
75. t. 2. Based on the Mongolian Subbi:t$ita-ratna-nidbi or directly on the
Tibetan Subba~ita~ratna-nidbi is the eastern Mongolian, Buryat work by Lama
Irdini Maybzun Gallishev who lived among tbe Buryats in the second half of the
nineteenth and in the beginning of the twentieth century. He prepared his
uMirror of Wisdom". published in Russian translation in 1966 in Ulan~Ude. 3
According to the introduction to this work, Lama Irdini prepared his work com-
posed of 979 subh;,~ita.-s on the basis of subha~ita-s of Gunga--al-an in Tibetarn, i.e.,
the Sa-~kya kun dgah rf,!ya-mis'ban dpal-bzarg-po (Subbli$ita-ratna-nidhi). Many
Sanskrit subha:~ita-s can be traced in this work. including some from the
Pancatantra, Hitopadesa and the so-called Cal).akya's sayings.
76. In addition to these works, being translations from Tibetan, we find
in Mon~olia and Manchuria collections of wise sayings which ar.:reither trans-
lations from Sanskrit or were influenced by Sanskrit subhl1~ita-s. For instance
some of the Mongolian and Manchurian sayings collected by Louis Rocher 4
definitely show that they are of Sanskrit origin, e.g., the Manchurian saying (13)
which states that the king who likes the same things as his subjects like. who
hates the same thing as his subjects bate, is like a father, mother to his subjects
is certainly influenced by a subhll~ita found in the Suktiratnabara (2.156) which
is a auotation from the Kautlllya-artha§listra U.19.34) or from the Mahabharata
(12.56) or Sukranitisara (4.4.204).

77. Some subhi2$ita-samllraha-s found also their way to Central Asia.
We :find, for instance. among the finds of the German Turfan Expedition to
Eastern Turkestan some fra~ments of the L a g b u-C a t:l a k y a v e r s i on of

78.1. Sanskrit subhll$ita-s of didactic and gnomic character influenced the
Tamil niti-Iiterature, in particular some of the 18 main didactic worl~s. i e.,
the N:datiyar with its famous quadrains, the Tiru-k-kural (both divided according
to the three puru~l1rtha-s). the NllnrnaQ.i-k-ka~ikai, the Inn~-narpatu, tbe Iniyavai
narpatu. the Tirikatukam, the Acara-k-kevai.. the Corupai'icamulam, the ~l~ti. the
¥utumnli-k-kana and to the lesser extent the Palamoli, the K11rnil"rpatu,
tbe Kalavali narpatu, the Kainni1ai, the TiiJaimoli aimpatu, the Timaimlilai
natraimpatu, the Aintinai aimpatu and the Aintinai elupatu, as well as
such works as the Niti·venptt, Niti-neri-vilakkam, Nat).t)eri, Nalvali and
Aranericc~ram which contain Sanskrit suMC'l~ita-s. It is very likely that the
Tamil niti-literature as well as the South Indian Sanskrit literature influenced the
niti-literature of Ceylon. 2
78.2. The Simhalese subhn$ita~samgraha-s, such as the S u b h a ~ i -

was published on the basis of two South Indian manuscripts and some ancilliary
sources, of which one was the Ceylonese Vyasakaraya 1 which is almost ident1cal
with the Sans~rit Vyasasubha!?ita-sarhgraha ; the latter was certainly the basis
for the Ceylonese Vyasakaraya.
79.2. There is not such a clear-cut in the case of the Ceylonese
p r a t y a y a s a t a k a, a suhh1~Ua-samgraha in Sanskrit, well known in Ceylon 2
containing 102 wise sayings in sardulavikridita-, vasantatilaka-. upajati- and sloka-
'metres. In the Pratyayasataka the Sanskrit subha$it2-s are seldom reproduced in
their primary original form ; if they are reprodJ.ced at all, they are r~produced in
the vu1gate text and in the most popular form ; the majority of these subha~ita-s
were borrowed from the classical sources of Sanskrit literature.· In addition some
subhll$ita-s are paraphrases of kno .vn suf:Jha$ita-s ; this paraphrase is usually
correct as far the contents of the wise saying is concerned but not as far as its
form ; often some subha~ita-s are composed of two to four different components
taken from more than one Sanskrit subh'a§ita ; there are also many subhasita-s
only influenced by thoughts wbicb we also :find in Sanskrit subha~ita-s. Ali the
subhil~ita-s which are paraphrases, or combinations of several subha~ita-s, or
verses influenced by some subha~1.ta-s, or,, finally, verses containing· thoughts
similar to those known to exist among Sanskrit subha~ita-s, may have existed in
the form preserved in the Pratyayasataka, but at present are still unknown.s
79.3~ As far as forlli is concerned, the S u b h a ~ i t a y a of
A 1 i g a y a v a n n a, a Simhalese subhd~ita-sarhgraha of 100 verses, is similar to
the Pratyayasataka. Also most of the subha~ita-s included in the Subha~itaya
are well-known Sanskrit subha~ita-s ; some of these suohCl~ita-s are also
paraphrases of well-known w1se sayings or were influenced by the Sanskrit
~ubha~ita-s. Only the 17 verses of the first part of this anthology, which is
Buddbistic in character were probably not borrowed from the Indian literature.
79.4.
In addition to these subhil§ita-sarhgraha-s, the whole collection of
Ci'ii).akya's wise sayings is prevalent in Ceylon ; that is the CaQ.akya-niti-sastra
version.'

80.1. Probably there must have existed in India, in the thirteenth,
· fourteenth or fifteenth century a collection of wise sayings which was particularly
well known among the Manipurian Pm.J,t:ta-s ; this collection which was, as J. Gray
repmted, 1 written in Bengal! characters, but also known in Sanskritis<?d Burmese,
penetrated into Burma and became well known as the Lokaniti, one of the four.
·best known in Burma collections of wise sayings ; the three others are· the
Dhamman'lti, the Ra:janiti and the Lokasara.
to
80.2. It is impossible
ascertain when these collections of wise sayings
were compiled.. }. Gray found tbe earliest reference in Burmese literature to the
Lokaniti and Ra:janiti in the Arakan raza:win or the "Chronicles of Arakan'' in
connexion with Prince Kha Maung's visit to Pegu early in the seventeenth centurs, ,
but did not find any reference to tbe Dhammanlti.
80.3. G. E. Gerini in his "Siamese Proverbs and Idiomatic Expressions'' 2
• has shown that imitations of the Lokaniti occurred in a Burmese inscription at
Pagan dating from 1408 or 1416 A.D. He thought that the Lokaniti was
composd between 425 and 1400 A D. He saw the date a quo in the commentary
on thz Dhammapad~-the Dhammapadatthakatha-ascribed to Buddbagho!?a, in
which he could notice ''strict analogies" between certain passages of the Lokaniti
and the Dhammapadattbakatha. On the other hand C. Temple 8 thought that
' the Lokaniti was not '"of any great antiquity".·
80.4. ]. Gray considered that it was unlikely that the Lokaniti and the
two other nHi-works were compiled between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries.
He ·seems to be right when saying that the wars between tbe M6n.-s and Burmese
ied to intercommunication between the two .races. ]. Gray also stated that
Hindu colonists, besides, had settled on the lower 'Valleys of the Trr11 wadi and
Sittang rivers, and a religious struggle between Bra:hm~l)as and Buddhists resulted
in evolving the eruditlon of the learned PUI)r,ta·S. Their services were soon utilized
by the Burmese kings in furtherance of the cause of hterature, aod it was through
their invaluable assistance that the study of Sanskrit became a sine qua non in the
ro:Yal monasteries. Being familiar with the Magadhi language and the local
vernaculars they were of .great help to the Buddhist ra~an-s in the interpretation
of the Pitagat. J. Gray was further of the opinion that it was reasonable

suppose that when the great task was completed attention was paid· to· secular
literarture, the outcome of which was the compilation of the Lokaniti, Dhamma-
nlti and Ra:j.aniti.
80.5. It is most probable that these niti-works were prepared for a king's
i1ci2r:Va in order to enable him to discourse on·. ethics and polity, to pronounce
moral sayings and give advice. 1 J. Gray thought that since these treatises were
,.
(,
'
in use in the royal courts of India they could have been introduced in the Court
of Ava.
80.6. C. Temple who, independently o£ ]. Gray's research, studi,ed the
Lokaniti, could not find out much about the history of this book. although he
personally made enquiries from the Burmese Sayll.-s. He reported th~t a·ccording
to one acconnt it was written originally at an unknown date in Sanskrit (or Pa:li)
by the P6ngn(l (BrahmaQa) Sannekqyaw and paraphrased -into Burmese in1826 by
the Hp6ngyi U P6k of the M a ha Oung M ye B&ag San Ok Kyoung at Ava. This
U P6k's name as priest was Sek:-k~m-da-bi, to which the king· of Ava added the
titles of Thlri Thaddamma-da:z;a, Maha Dama-yaza Guru. According to· another
informant of C. Temple, the author was a priest. without very extraordinary
knowledge of P~li who either collected · the . wise sayings ·from old books or
collected some of them and added others of his own composition.
80.7. During my stay in Burma. in, 1961, I . also . made · unsuccessful
enquiries into the origin of the three niti-collections. I . contacted the Inter-
national Institute for Advanced Buddhistic Studies, Kaba Aye, Ra~goon and
several Burmese Saya-s in Rangoon, Mandalay~ Pegu and Pagan but -~o one. could
give me any information about these th.ree nzti~works; although rh~ny ot"t~em
knew about the existence of the Lokaniti, more by name than by its· contents ;
they only knew that it was a book of proverbs on common life.
to
80.8. It does not seem yet possible
know when these niti-works were
compiled. The date suggested by Gerini seems to be t.oo early~· since· the
analogies with Buddhagho!?a's Dhamma-padatthakatha 2 are more likely ·to. be
accidental and the moral sayings included in the Lokaniti are of a general and
common nature. Te!Jlple's date of 18~6 is .certainly .too late ; it probably. r~fers
one of the translations of the Pali Lokaniti into Burmese, while the Pali text
was known in Burma much earlier. Therefore, it ~s quite p~ssibl~ · that ·the

Lok:aniti was composed in the beginning of the fifteenth century 1 and that the
three other niti-collections were compiled not mu:b later.
Sl.t. The Pali L o k an I t i is known today in Burma more by its
name than by its contents. Two different independent transhtions into English
were made in 1886 from Pali by J. Gray 11 and from Burmese in 1875 (published in
1878) by R. C. Temple. 8 Gray's translation contains 167 wise sayings while
Temple's translation 164 wise sayings. This difference is due to the fact that C.
Temple combined sometimes two wise sayings into one. 4 The Lokaniti is divided
into seven distinct sections dealing with; (1) wise men (1-40); (2) good men
(41-67); (3) the evil-doer (68-78) ; (4) friendship (79-93) ; (5) women (94-111) ;
(6) kings (112-137) ; and (7) miscellanea (133-167) ; such n division of subject-
matters is very common to Sanskrit subha;~ita-samgraha-s.
81.2. The origin of a great part of Lokaniti wise sayings can be traced
to classical Sanskrit sources and, in particular. to the Mahabhl'lrata, the Hito-
padesa, the Pancatantra, the so-called C~l).akya's wise sayin~s, the Manava-
dharma.,.sastra, etc.
i-K. y
a n 5 is the Burmese translation
of the Pali Lokan1ti. In the Nlti-Z:yan many verses (gathez-s) are divided into
two or four parts and therefore the number of wise sa:yings of the N1ti-;Kyan is
211 instead of 167 found in the Lokaniti.
82.1. It was proved that the N I t
The Niti-I{yan was translated in 1858 by E. Fowle 11 who wrote
that this anthology was taught in the Burmese monasteries to the daily scholars
and residents-novices ; it was always in use and was generally known as being one
of the elementary books in Burma, since it contained moral teachings, popular in
India which could be applied in every day life.
82.2.
83. In addition to this collection of subhl1$ita- s of Sanskrit oiJgm,
there are three other subhll~ita-samgraha-s also greatly influenced by Sanskrit
subha$ita-s. These are the Pali Rajaniti, the Pali Dhammanlti and the Pa.li
Lokasara.

83.1. The P«li R! j an It i is a typical Indian subha~ita-samgraha,
dealing-as its title shows~with rajaniti ; it contains 136 wise saying.s. According
to J, Gray it was based on the Indian dharmasastra-s and was compiled by the
Br~hmal)a-s Anantanal)a and GaQamissaka. It does not seem to be correct to
state that the Pali Rajanil:i was based on Indian dharmasl'lstra-s : it was rather
based on sanskrit subha~ita-samgraha-s, and in particular on one version of
Cal}.akya's sayings, viz., the Cal)akya-sara-samgraha version. The first 20 wise
sayings dealing with king's officials, their duties and qualifications and the group
of wise 8ayings 48-55 were,. no doubt, borrowed, either .directly or indirectly,
from Ccll)akya's collections of wise sayings.: the latter group -follows almost word
for word the Oi:J.J.akya-sara-samgraha version. 1
83.2.1. The~Pa.li D h a m m a 11 I t i is also a typical Indian subhll~ita­
samgraha ; it contains 411 wise sayings (plus three introductory verses) and is
divided into 24 sections dealing with the preceptor, scholarship, wisdom,
knowledge, conversation, wealth, residence, dependence, friendship, the bad man,
the good man, the powerful, women, sons. servants, the wise man, what should be
done, what should be avoided, ornamentation, kings, ministration, two's, three's
etc., misce1lanea.2.
83.2.2. The Dhammaniti contains a great number of Sanskrit subhi!~ita-s,
of which many are identical with the Pali Lokaniti but, generally ,speaking, the
Dbammaniti is more losely connected with Sanskrit sources than the Pali Rajanlti
and, particularly, the Pali Lokan1ti. The wise sa:vings of .the Dbammaniti are
seldom straight translations of Sanskrit wise sayings : they are, rather paraphrases
of Sanskrit subhll§ita-s.
83.2.3. The Pali Dhammaniti is not as common in Burma as the
Lokanlti, but :is better known than the Pali Rajaniti; it never became a handbook
of study in Burma and, being much longer than the Lokaniti and R~janiti, was
not so willingly recopied by scribes : it also did not have the reputation of being
originated in India, though it is, at least in part, a translation or ·paraphrase of
Sanskrit subha~ita-s, particularly from the Hitopadesa, Pancatantra, other katha.

·87.1.1. The Sup'hasit of P'hrah Raang exists in several editions. 1
Gerini translated 158 subhl2#ta-s which sbow influence of Indian thinking,
but are rather composed in the form of proverbs than subhi:l. 5ita-s.
1
88. E. Lorgeou in Bulletin de 1' A the nee Oriental 2 translated in his
"Suphasit Siamois" a number of Silimese wise sayings ; some of them were
influenced by Indian thinking and are writ~en in tbe styte of Sanskrit subha~ita-s ;
however some of these Sia:mese wise sayings are quite different and are not of
Ind!an origin. According to Lorgeou their origin is obscure ; they were collected
in !the beginning of the nineteenth century by a monk who lived in a monastery
in Bangkok.
89. Gerini quoted also some other Si~mese sup'hasit-s, the most
important of which are the P u s o n L ~ n (The grandfather's teaching to his
grandchild) and the L :r n son P n (The grandchild's teaching to his grand-
.father) ; they are probaBly of Uro origin but wt>re well-known in Si11m. The
National Library in ~Bangkok has registered in its catalogue these two works in
T'ai verse and the Pu st'ln Lan also in "Sanskrit verse (sic 1). Unfortunately these
two works, despite long search, could not be found in the Library when I visit:ed
. Bangkok in 1961 and consequently .could not be a oalyzed by me. Since the Pa
son Urn was written in Sanskrit verse it may be surmised that it was also known
in India and be of Indian origin. Probably then the same applies to Lll:n son Pt:i.
One text of Pa son Lan in the National Library in Bangkok is a work of Xieng
Mai literature ; it is written on palm leaves.
90. L. Finot 8 mentioned also that two additional anthologies of
wise sayings existed in Siam, viz., the P i p' h e k s o n b 0 t and the Pali S .{) n
n 6 n. 4 however they contain teachings from the R:imliyai).a (Vibhi~ai).a 's to his
"family and Bali's to Sugriva). Particularly the latter one is well-known in Siam.
!hough undoubtedly of Indian origin, these teachings are not .mbhi'l~~ita-s par
excellance.
91. The Sia:mese proverbs 'and wise sayings which were collected by
Gerini and Giihler5 (Gerini collected 208 8 and GUhler 276) are, similarly as the
'P'hra];l Ruang's maxims, short sentences and were probably of local origin,

although some of the thoughts coincided with Western ideas. 1 Some of the wise
sayings were of Indian origin ; that can be seen from the fact that they often refer
to the Racnayar).a and the Mahabharata and heroes of these two epics, as Well as
mention of Indian gods, in particular Garuga; it seems also that they were.
influenced by the Pancataotra and the Hitopadesa tales, but most of them were
adapted to the local daily life.
9.2. In the twentieth century the Sanskrit Vyasa-subha~ita-sarhgraha
became also known in Siam as the V y a: k a: r a § a t k a. It was probably brought
from Ceylon during the reign of king Rama III and printed 2 in Siamese characters
with the help of a Bmhmal).a, Mukupusvami (?) and Luang Phirivanahorn and then
distributed at the cremation ceremony of Amrnart Trl P'hra Turuparkpichorn. 3
93. Also a collection of CaQakya's sayings the "Sanskrit C a n a k y a
s a t a k a" 1 is known in Siam ; it is registered in the catalogue of the National
Library in Bangkok, 6 but could not be traced when I visited Bangkok in 1961. 6
Also under the auspices of the Royal Institute a translation of the Cal).akya-
~ataka into Siamese was prepared by P hra];l P'binic hevarnakar and was published
in 1922 7 ; it is the text of the Caoakya-niti-sastra version.

It was impossible to ascertain whether any other

100. L. Finot referred further to the publication of a series of Lao adages
of Xieng Mai (S u p' h a s i t L 11 o X i e n) which however was not finished. 1
101. In addition, among others, fifteen La:o proverbs were recorded by
E. ·G. Gerini, 2 eleven by W. Gi.ihler", fifteen by P. Levy 4 and twenty by P. S.
N ginnll ; they are of peasant, earthy type of everyday wisdom and only seldom
show Indian influences. 8 However, the Laotian Lokanlci is certainly, as other
Lokanlti-s, of Indian origin.
102. My other endeavours in Cambodia, La:os and Vietnam in 1961 and
then in 1967 and 1968 ~to find there other sources of gnomic literature showing
Indian influences were unsuccessful, particularly due to the lack of interest in this
part of the world in older literatures. I am convinced, however, that many
other subha~ita-s of Sanskrit ongin exist also there.

103. The Hindu-s must have established political authority in Java by
the beginning of the second century A. D. In Java there were severa 1 Hindu
kingdoms ; two of these called Cbo-po and Ho-lo~tan by the Chinese, sent regular
embassi,es to China in the fifth century A.D. The names of the kings of both
these countries ended with •'-varman", showing Indian influence. Tbe first great
Hindu empire was founded by the Saileodra dynasty in the eighth century A. D.
With the Hindu acculturation came also the Sanskrit literature, including Sanskrit
subha~ita-savigraha-s. Partictilarly two subha?ita-sa.mgraha-s, viz. the Sara-
samuccaya and the Slokantara became very popular: both are well preserved. 7
104.1. The Old 1 Javanese S :r r a sa mu cc a y a was well known in
Java a.nd · Bali. as the book of moral precepts collected from different Sanskrit
three distinct treatises: (1) K 0 il S u p'h as it ; (2) A I}. a c n k T ha m mac a k, a
code of offences and punishment ; anb (3) Sat t a h lL r d h a m m a, duties of an official.
He gave five examples of these sayings, but none seems to be of Indian origin.

Juynboll who published' 117 of the wise sayings included in this anthology ; it
contains ·517 wise sayings ·and, as C. Hnoykaas remarked 1, is the "best source for
Old Javanese literature hitherto known". Almost all su.bhe~$ita-s included in this
subho~ita-samgraha could have·been·identified in Sanskrit sources 2 ;. out of 517 'wise
sayings quoted in this anthology 332 (or two-thirds) were borrowed from, or were
influenced by, the Maha:bharata, sixty· wise sayings occur in various collections
of· Ciit)akya~s sayings, 33 occur in the Pancatantra, 30 in the Gamc,la-purana. 20

104.2. The Sarasamuccaya was edited in the Sata:-"pitaka-Series, No. 24
in Delhi in 1962. Its collator is V a r a r u c i who in the introduction stated that he
collected "all'tbe essentials of the Mab.abharata, the composition of His reverence
Vyasa'' to whom he paid homage. In the explanation to the sixth verse Vararuci;
referring to himself wrote : "henceforth he will say what is best in this Bh1Irata
epic: It is designated Silirasamuccaya ; sZlra signifies essence and samuccaya is its
accumulation." Therefore Raghu Vira who translated the whole work and wrote
a preface to it remarked : "The Sarasamuccaya is the Giti!i of ·the BaHnese
Hindu-s. As designed by its author Vararuci, it contains the essence of the high
teachings and noble ideas set forth in the Mahabh:rrata.''
104.3. On the basis of the edition of the Sarasamuccaya in the Sata-
pitaka-Series and additional two lontars (which do not contain any important
variants) Tjokorda Rai Sudharta published in mirneographed form the first 255
verses of the Sarasamuccaya in Sanskrit and Old Javanese transcriptions as well as
the lridonesian translation of the Old Javanese text ; it appeared in tbe Parisada
Hindil Dharma Pusat in Denpasar (Bali) 1968. The whole Sa:rasamuccaya so
edited and translatedwas expected to appear in printed form in 1972, but did not
appear yet.

IOIUct.INTRODUCTION
eH a:
105.1. The existence of the Old Javanese · S l·o k! ·n· tar a was known
for· a very long time 1 : it was however brought to light in a-critical· edition only
in 1957; it was then published in the International Academy ofiridian Culture
and critically edited by Sharada Rani.2
105.2. The Slok5:ntara contains 83 sa-yings which ate followed b-y an
Old Jav-:mese prose-e)(planation which, as its editor stated, ''though usually dose
to tbe origianl stanza. is at time~ quite prolix. This style·of exposition is still to
be seen in India, where the religious preachers and purlltliC narrators explain the
Sanskrit ~loka·s and further elaborate ·them by their own exp1anations', 8 "
Slokantara verses, similarly as Ceylonese Pratyayasataka verses, contain often
paraphrases of known Subha~ita-s. 4
105,3. The Slolttintra does not correspond "to the niti-text of San.skrit lite-
rature", as Sharada Rani suggested: it is somewhat an unusual text of a subhll~ita­
sarhJ!ralw becallSe of the preponderance of purely dharmasllstra verses : .. such
verses are sometime~ included in subhil~ita-samgraha-s, but never occupy ·as much
as one-fourth of the whole subhc:!~ita-samgraha, as is the case of the Slokantara.
Otherwise; however, it can be considered as a subhll~ita-si!mgraha. If we do not
connt some twenty verses, which are dharmcdtlstra verses, half of the rest, i.e .. 27
verses are of Ca:t;1akya origin or were influenced by the so-called ·. C::toakya's
sayings .
. 105.4. The importance of the Slokantara, . similarly. as the importance
of the Sarasamuccaya, is enhanced by the ·preservation of "lost" .texts ; the
Sloka:ntara contains the same "lost'' Ma:nava-dharmasiistra verse which we find
in the Sarasamuccaya, 5 as well as an additional ''lost" Manava~dbarmasllstra
verse. o·

106.1. Less. popular, but also important is the Old Javenese N 1 t i:"'
~ a s t r a of NI t i s l!l r a, 1 composed, according to Dr. Poerbatjaraka the editor
of ·this Old Javanese subh~$ita-samgraha, in the last years of Mahapahit 11 ;
it contains 120 verses in fifteen chapters.
106.2. Dr. C. Hooy_kaas was of the opmton that the Old Javanese
Nitisastra gave the impression of being purely Indian in origin. The garb, how-
ever, in which the maxims have been clad, though also of Indian origin, did not
favour exact translation ; its metres must at times have driven the poet to some
abbreviations, at other times to enlargements and additions. He also very rightly
concluded that it was doubtful whether it would be possible to detect one definite
treatise as a source ;. the Javanese may only have rearranged the contents of the
work. but also may have omitted from or/and added to it ; the work may also
have been an anthology from the very beginning. U. N. Ghoshal characterised
it as "a coiiection of wise sa-yings, mora] precepts and so forth of the Ciit;takya-
niti-dass''. 8
1 06. 3. It Feerns that it would have been, better to characterise this work
as an OYd Javanese subha~ita-samgra.ha, since many o£ those sayings which could
be identified are found exclusively in some Sanskrit subhil~ita-samgraha-s and not
in primary . sources. This anthology might have been, as Dr. C. Hooykaas
suggested. a work rearranged by a Javanese compiler with omissions or additions ;
it rnmt be added. however, that it is far from a purely Sanskritized text ; the wise
~ayings are, generally sp~aking, not translations of the Sanskrit text into Old
Javanef.e but a paraphrase of the Sanskrit sayings written very often in corrupt

1 06.4. A great number of subhlt$ita-s included in this anthology are so·

dharrnasastra, the Rarnaya~a, the Pai'icatantra, the Mab~bharata, the Hitopadda
and other Sanskrit sources.
107.1. Also the Pai'icatantra with many of its $Ubhll§ita~s became very
popular in Java, Bali and Madura; it was known there as T a n t r i

Pai'icatentra :it seems to be nearest to the Paficatantra of Durgasirhha 1 • We find
in this part of the world at least twelve different rec:ensions of the Paiicatantra,
of which the oldest three are written in a sort of Old Javane3e, several in Middle
Javanese and Balinese, two in New Javanese and two otbers.in Madurese. 2
l 07.2. The best text of the Old Javanese Tantri K~mandaka was edited
and translated by C. Hooykaas 5 • The Old Javanese text, written in prose with
some added verses, which are mostly subha~ita-s, contains only 83 such verses'. not
all of which can be found in the different texts of the Pai'icatantra ; most of those
verses which could not be traced to the Sanskrit Pancatantra could be found in the
Maha:bharata, Bhartrhari's Sa.taka-s, or among wise sayings attributed to Ca:oakya.
108. Also the Ud'Yoga-Bbi$ma-parvan-s of the Mahiibharata which
contains a great number of wise sayings were known well in Old Javanese ; so also
was the Adi-parvan. 5
109.' It is well-known that many Indian fables-with hundreds of inser-
ted niti-sayings-were incorporated into the literatures not only to the East of
India but also to the West of India. The Pai'icatantra, for instance, became
known not only in the whole of South-East Asia, but was also translated into
Pehlevi by A.D. 570 ; this text was then translated into Old Syri3tc and old
Arabic, as the Kahlah wa-Dimna (later called also the fables of Bidjpai). The
text spread through Hebrew, Greek and other translations such as of Rabbi Joel,
Symeon Seth. Giulio Nutti, Jobannes di Capua, A. von Pforr, Abu'l Ma1li
Nushrallah ibn Mul:tarnmad ibn Abdul I:Iamid, Anw:11ri Suhaili, etc. to the West
of Indta. The Hitopadesa has been known in the West for a very long time; a
translation of this collection of fables was alread'Y made into English in 1787 and
from then into most European languages. The Sukasaptati served as the basis
for the 14th century Nakshabi version of the Persian Tati-nameh and the 17th
century version of MuiJammad Qadiri; it spread then to Turkey as the Turkish
~.rersion of the Tm;:I-nameh with additions from the Vetillapaiicavimsatika. Motifs
of the Sukasaptati are found in the 'Arabian Thousand and One Nights' and parti-

INTRODUCTION
'ct.dar]y in the Kit§b et=-Sindbiid and even in Gottfried's Tristan und lsotde, ·not to
mention many ·translations of Sukasaptati into European langua~~s. The
Vikramacarita was not only translated into Newiiri and as Sib-songlian~ into
Siamese but also in 1574 by order of the Emperor Akbar into Persian. By name
·.of. Arji--Borji Cban (Raja Bhoja) it was abso[hed into the Tibetan and the
Mongolian literatures. Also translations, though of a later date, were made into
European languages. Finally the VetalapancavirMatik1I was early translated into
Newari, Tibetan and Mongolian-Kalmuck, and through Braj-bb[l;l~. Hindi and
other modern Indian languages has greatly influenced under the name Bait!ll-
pacbis1, pat"ticularly in the nineteeth century, the English ·literature with Richard
Burton's Vikram and the Vampire, or Tales of Hindu Devilry. It also became
partly known in Turkey through the Turkish version~"of Nakshabi's Tatl Nameh,
where some stories of the Vetalapai:lcavimsatikrr were also incorporated. In this
way, that is through translations into foreign languages the Sanskrit katha-litera-
ture, which is full of niti-sayings, became widely known not only in the East but
also :in the West and were often quoted in Europe.
110. Some Sanskrit niti-sayin~Is were also included in the Old and New
Testament. For instance Mahabbilrata 's subhll$ita-s such as "You see the faults
of .others even if they are as small as a grain of mustard. but you do not want
to see you!" own fau1ts even if they are as big as the bilva-fruit' (MBh. 1.69.1) are
found in St. Mathews 7.3 and in the Talmud 'Arakhin 16 : or the Mahlibharata
subha~ita "Do not do to others what is disagreeable to yourself : that is dharma ;
the other proceeds from desire" (MBb. 5.39. 57) is found in St. Mathews 7.12, St.
Luke 6.31 and in the Rabbi Hillel's dictum ; or the sayjng ( nya_va) of the
Mahabharata "do not react evil with evil" (MBh. 3.198.43) and •'whatever one has
sown that one reaps" (MBb. 12.287.44) are also found respectively in the Epistle
of Paul, the Apostle to the Romans, (12.17) and in the Epistle o£ Paul. the
Appostle to the Galatians, (6.7); and in many others. It must, however, be
emphasised that the ascriptions of these maxims to Sanskrit texts should be made
'witb great care for they may belong to the floating mass of oral tradition being
the property of the whole of mankind. 1
111. Undoubtedly many more collections of niti-sayings bf Sanskrit
origin exist in 'Greater India' but with so many·works still hurried in the various
lands of South-East Asia and difficulties in getting the needed information. it is
:impossible to ascertain the existence of other treasures of Sanskrit niti-literature
which spread over 'Greater India'. It is certain that with the progress of Indian
studies in 'Greater India' this important branch of Sanskrit literature will become
better known in the nearest future.

of the world, playing on the (lute under
the wish-granting tree with deJtterous

with eyebrows slightly raised~ with lips

The soldiers of the King of the Anga-s
-were all shattered; the Kalinga-s found
sporting ground in impenetrable forest
regions; those of Trilinga (Andhra-s)
develdp~d a desire to plunge into the
waters of the heavenly Ganges; the
Variga-s (BengaHs) had their bodies
shattered; ·the La.ta-s (Gujedit) had
their fore-heads perspiring; the Cola-s
found solace in the quickness of their feet.
Thus did thy enemies, 0 Nizam of

Sickness springs from drinking excess
of water; equally harmful arc the effects
of drinking too little of it. Hence a
person should frequently drink small
quantities of water in order to increase
the fire (of digestive capacity).

I converted you (in my praise y into
the best of generous persons, full of humi'-
lity, though dose-fisted, the unhandsome
into one rich in beauty, a defeated one
into an all conquering hero, and an ill-
born into a nobly born, on account of
my hopes of reward; and if my hopes
turn out false, then indeed are all my
statements falsified. (A.A.R.)

A non-giver [close fisted person] is a
mendicant (in the next birth) and one
who is generous (in giving gifts) is always
a tyiigi [a noble person who performs
actions with no thought of reward].
Discriminating thus by one's own intelli~
gcnce, one should give again and again.

Love which has not for long gained
control of the girl's modesty swells only in
her heart and is born bewildered in her
body. She fears to 11urrender herself;
she desires her friend to expatiate on the
pleasure with her lover. Inexperienced
in conversation, she does not look him
in the face. Not sati!:fying her lover with
the flavours of the ripe mango-fruit oflove,
the girl, like the sP.lendour of summer,
torments him only (Miles Dillon's trans-
lation ). 1

Endless [far spreading] is the fame. of
the king, the patron or lilies in the form
of poets. How is ,this fame contained in

it? This apprehension is out of place;
for you can see how li ttlc the surface of
a mirror is and how the broad figure of
a lordly elephant is reflected in it (A.A.R.).

to his fame; for with tears of inward joy
he cloth not cover his eyes, being about

Between the two kinds of blind persons,
he who became blind with regard to
worldly concerns, is the really blind one;
the common blind cannot use his eyes
only, but he who is blind with regard to
worldly concerns cannot use any of his
organs. To me, 0 Lord, who am blind by the
loss of the great treasure of discrimination
and who am thrust into the deep well of
delusion by the powerful robbers called
the senses, 0 lord of Gods, give a helping
hand as deserving all pity (A. A. R. ).
