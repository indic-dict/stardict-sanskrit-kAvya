II I.PREFACE
Volume V of the Mahasubha~ita-Samgraha is being issued
under the most painful circumstances. Dr. Ludwik Sternbach, the
author of the Volume, passed away suddenly on March 25, 1981,
when the printing of the Volume was yet to commence. May be
that he was not in the best of health, but he seemed to have a
premonition of what was to come. For, he wrote in his letter from
Turin, dated 28. 12. 1980, addressed to Dr. K. V. Sarma, who was
to vet and edit the Volume : "The last wish of mine . is that Vol. V
of the Mahttsubh.ll$ita-Sarhgraha appears for the V World Sanskrit
Conference in Varanasi and that you work on it with full speed.
I beg you to do it." He added in the same letter, 1 do hope that
I shall be able to return to Paris, but I doubt that I shall survive
the operation to be. undertaken, probably some time in the second
half of January. So, reply to me as soon as possible." He said
further, 1 have also made arrangements that my fortune (with the
exception of other bequeaths to my family and friends which I
Dr. L. Sternbach
have made) be given, after my death, to the
Foundation'' to be administered by the Vishveshvaranand Vedic
Research Institute in Hoshiarpur for the continuation of the
Mahasubha~ita-Sarhgraha," being the fulfilment of a pious promise
which he had made to the Institute, as early as in 1973, while
persuading the Institute to accept his Mahasubha~ita-Sarhgraha,
for publication.

True to its academic tradition, the Institute immediately
wrote to Dr. Stern bach a most reassuring and comforting reply
wishing him full recovery and stating that the Institute would
undertake the responsibility of continuing his great work in the
lines that he had set out and that he would have the satisfaction of
seeing Vol. V of the work being issued on the occasion of the
V World Sanskrit Conference. It is a matter of great grief that
Dr. Sternbach is not alive to witness the publication of his work,viii
MA HA-SUBHA ~IT A-SAMGRAHA
though the V. V. R. Institute has seen to it that it was issued as
he had desired.
The timely issuance of this Volume is due also to another
fortituous circumstance.
Dr. K. V. Sarma whose scholarly advice
was available to the undersigned in vetting and editing the previous
four volumes of the work to the entire satisfaction of Dr. Sternbach,
retired on l. l. 1980 as the Director-Professor of the University
Wing of the Institute and the undersigned had to shoulder the
responsibilities of that Wing, with the result that work on the
MahasubhC1$ita-Samgraha came to a standstill. In the meanwhile,
Dr. Sarma had accepted the assignment as Academic Adviser to
the well-known firm of Indological publishers, Ms. Motilal Banarsidass.
Dr. Sternbach was, naturally, jnsistent upon his work being resumed
and, in the changed circumstances, preferred Dr. Sarma to take
up the editing of the work.
Therefore, the Institute invited
Dr. Sarma to rejojn it and it goes to the credit of Dr. Sanna that
he paid heed to that invitation, gave up his lucrative job and
assumed charge of Dr. Sternbach's work, as a labour of 1ove, on
account of his addiction to academk pursuits.
The present Volume of the Mahasu.bha~ita-Sarhgraha which is
issued as No. 75 of the Vishveshvaranand 1 ndological SeriesJ records
about 2000 wise sayings and entertaining verses in Sanskrit beginning
with the Devan~gari letters ~ and <fiT, numbered 8265 to 9979,
with a number of additional verses inserted between the regularly
The pattern of presentation is the same as in
numbered verses.
the previous volumes.
The verses as extracted from the extant
subha~ita works and poems in Sanskrit and from texts of Indian
origin preserved in Greater Indian literatures such as those of
Tibet, Ceylon, Indonesia, Cambodia and other countries, have
been carefully edited and presented with the documentation of
their primary, secondary and Greater Indian sources.
This
is followed by the textual variants found in the different sources.
A readable translation of the Sanskrit text into English follows,
enabling the non-Sanskritist reader to grasp the innate wisdomP~EFACE

and 'poetic -charm· of 'the ·verses.
Footnotes are added wherever
necessary to explain contexts, indicate references and point out
allusions.
Three Indexes ·are appended to the Volume, being : I. Index
of Authors and Sources, wherein brief details of the individual authors
and also of works from which the verses have been extracted are given
with the enumeration of the verses concerned ; 11. Index of- Sanskrit
Metres, wherein the verses in the different metres, have been listed;
and, IlL Subjec.t Index, .in which the innumerable topics dealt with
or referred to in the verses have been identified and indexed
alphabetically with cross-references. It is to be hoped that . thi~
Volume will receive from its cultured readers the same welcome as
was accorded to the earlier volumes.
The painstaking labour which Dr. Sternbach has put in
towards the compilation of this Volume is better visualised than
stated. Dr. K. V. Sarma, with his characteristic enthusiasm and
devotion to work, has edited the verses intensively, checking the entries
and the references, vetting translations and adding notes 1 when
required. He has also himself translated a large number of verses
and has prepared the three Indexes to the Volume. The credit of the
neat printing of the work in the course of a few months goes to the
workers of the V. V. R. I. Press.
Before I close, I desire to mention that, in accordance with
the wishes of Dr. Sternbach, this Institute has set up a Dr. Ludwik
Sternbach Foundation with the primary object of continuing the
compilation and publication of the 20-volume series of M ahllsubha~ita­
Samgraha, the completion of the unfinished writings of Dr. Sternbach
and pursuance of editing and research in the realm of Indian antho·
logical literature. We appeal to all lovers of Sanskrit and Indian
culture and also scholars in general to help in the activities of this
newly started Foundation. In fact, we would be thankful to our
readers for any constructive suggestion or academic and other
contribution that they could render in the above behalf and thus

MEMORIAM
PROF. DR. LUDWIK STERNBACH
( 1909'-1981 )
Perhaps next to the demise of its Founder-Director Acharya Dr. Vishva
Bandhu in 1973 and of its benign President Diwan An and Kumar in 1981, the V. V.
Research Institute has sustained the most severe blow in the sudden demise of
Dr. Ludwik Sternbach, a close associate, friend and benefactor of the Institute, on
March 25, 1981. He passed away as the result of a heart attack as he was returning
in a taxi after attending a meeting in Paris. He was a devoted researcher and an
indefatigable worker.
He bore a charming personality, affable, affectionate and
disarming, qualities which his close friends and fellow-workers, including the present
writer, can vouch for.
Dr. Sternbach's life and career were highly varied and eventful. He was
born in Cracow (Poland) on Dec. 12, 1909 as the son of an eminent lawyer and
studied law in the Jegellonian University at Cracow (1927-30). On passing out of the
University, he worked in a judicial court (1931-32}, then under a local lawyer (1932)
and commenced independent practice as a Member of the Bar at Cracow in 1937.
His interest in Indian culture and Jaw prodded him to study Sanskrit, which he did
under Prof. Mme. de Helena Willmann-Grabowska of the Department of Indian
Philology, combining his studies with his profession. He took his LL.D. in 1933 and
Ph.M. (Philosophy and Sanskritology) in 1936, his specialisation being Dharma.sastra
and Arthasastra. Since his Professor was the lone member of the staff of the Depart-
ment, he volunteered to assist in giving lectures and looking after the Library
(1933-37), when he was taken as a Reader in the Department (1937-38).
In the wake of the Nazi occupation of Western Poland and persecution of
Jews, Dr. Sternbach escaped penniless (1939) to Lwow in Eastern Poland, then under
Russian occupation. At Lwow he got an Assistant's job under Prof. Stefan Stasiak
in the Institute of Indian Philology and Culture of the University of Jan Casimir
(now Iwan Franko). When things began to hot up there, too, he left Lwow and
reached India via Turkey and Iraq, suffering manifold difficulties on the way.
In India, the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bombay gave asylum to this academic
pilgrim and he was accepted as Professor of Dharmas~stra and Indian Culture. In
this capacity he became assocj ated also with the Bombay Universit~. The seven yearsdi
MAHA..SUBHA~ITA-SAMGRAHA
(1940-46), which he spent in India, lecturing in the said two institutions, visiting
other University centres, and associating with Indian scholars, was the most forma tivc
period in the academic career of the ardent aspirer after learning that Dr. Stcrnbach
was. Thus, when the UNQ·was set up after the Second World War and Dr. Stcrnbach
was drafted to it, in 1947, as Deputy Director of Research in the Department of
Trusteeship on Non-Self-Governing Terrifories, he"left India not only as a Dhann.vlls-
tra-vidvan, but also as a Loka~kathll-vidvan (Master of.Indian folk-tales). Throughout
his tenure i~1 the above and senior capacitie~ in the UNO at Paris, Geneva and New
York, Dr. Sternbach continued, with zest, his Indianistic studies, which led him to
still another aJlied field, viz., the rich subhet.~ita literature in Sanskrit and developed
into a Subha[fita-vidvan too. His literary output and published writings during his
t,enure in the UNO from 1947 to 1970 is so prodigious that he seemed to have pursued
his academic studies with as much interest and ardour as his official duties.
When his term of Office at the UNO came to a close in 1970, he joined the
University of Sorbonne Nouvelle, Paris, as Professor of Indol.ogy, where he lectured
on Indian Culture for two years (1970-72) and later in the same capacity .in the
CoUegede Fra~ce for four years (1972-76).
During the last years of his life, he
maintained close, though informal, connection with the sa~d institutions nnd pursued
his academic studies and publication activities unremittingly. Throughout his life, he
suffered from poor health and impaired vision but that did not deter him from world
travel, frequent visits to India and lecturing at Universities and Institutes in the
countries that he visited.
While the subjects taken up for study by Dr. Sternbach were more of a
general than of a technical nature, what was lost in depth was amply made up in
,expanse. Thus, the published writings of Dr. Sternbach is, to say the least, stupcn~
dous both in bulk and in variety. More than thirty titles, in about ·fifty volumes,
some of them extending through a few hundred pagescach, besides a hundred and
fifty scholarly papers and over two hundred literary reviews is, indeed, an enviable
r·ecord even for an assiduous academician. His early writings centered round the
gnomic and didactic, and sociology, law and politics, in ancient India. While he
presented through the 6-volume Ca7Jakya-niti-text-tradition (Hoshiarpur, 1963), and
other similar text-editions, pithy Sanskrit texts prescribing the path of righteousness and
avoidance of pitfalls in life, in his exegetical works like the 2-volume Juridical studies
in ancient Indian law (1965, 1967), he correlated those texts with social customs
and legal tradition of the land according to the Dharmasastras and Smrtis. His
Bibliography of Kautilya's Arthasastra (l;loshiarpur, 1973) and Bibliography of
Dharma and Artha in Ancient India (Wiesbaden, 1973> ar~ ver~ useful referenc~
gooks on the sub:ject .·IN MEMORIAM

From amongst his works on Sanskrit subhiJ.sita, three deserve special
mention. First, his two substantial Supplements (Wiesbaden, 1965; Turin, 1974) to
the well-known .Tndische Spruche by 0. Boehtlingk. The second is his 2-volume
Descriptive catalogue of poets quoted in Sanskrit anthologies and inscriptions
(Wiesbaden, 1978, 1980), which forms the largest ever detailed documentation of
about 2000 authors, many of them known only through their stray verses.
The third is Mahasubha:jita-Samgraha, his magnum opus, a 20-volume "extensive
collection of wise sayings and entertaining verses in Sanskrit, with Introduction,
English translation, Critical notes and Indices." Four volumes of this work,
each containing five to six hundred pages, had already been issued by the
V.V. Research Institute, Hoshiarpur and further volumes were under preparation when
the hands of death snatched away Dr. Sternbach in the midst of his work. Possibly,
he had a premonition of his death, for he entrusted the continuation of the
compilation and publication of this priceless project to the V. V. Research Institute,
through a 'Dr. Ludwi!c Sternbach Foundation', which the Institute has since set up.
Dr. Sternbach was a member of several learned bodies and was the recepient
of several honours, but what he cherished most were the honorary doctorates which
the Sampuranand Sanskrit University, Varanasi and the Kameshwar Singh Sanskrit
University, Darbhanga, conferred in him, both in 1980, mainly in consideration
of his work on the Mahasubha.'jita-Sam.graha. It may be pertinent to name here
some of the Indological research institutions in India. with which Dr. Sternbach
had the closest academic association, viz., V. V. R. Institute, Hoshiarpur, All-India
Kashi Raj Trust, Varanasi, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bombay, the Bhandarkar
Oriental Research Institute, Poona, and Akhila Bharatiya Sanskrit Parishad, Lucknow.
Soft-spoken, pursuasive and unbelievably courteous, this Senior Officer of
the UNO who has achieved, in the literary field, perhaps, more than a well-placed
academician, has left a void in Indological scholarship. Indeed, his numerous friends
and admirers, both in India and in the West, will miss his benign presence in the
sessions of the World Sanskrit Conference, of which he was the Secretary-General and
the live force.

How can a person forego the sweet
company of the tender-hearted wife, as
also the dalliances and the charming
conversation that he holds with her ?
(How can a person being tightly bound
by the bonds of friendship relinquish the
company of his friends ?) What man
whose heart is captivated by lisping infants
can persuade his mind to be deprived of
such charming association of theirs ?
What being, remembering his sons,.
his beloved daughters absent at their
fathers-in-Jaw's place, his brothers, his
sisters, his poor parents, his house deco-
rated with handsome and valuable furni-
ture, his family profession, his servant
and the possession of domestic beasts that
he may have reared up, can ever renounce
them ? (J. M. Sanyal).2210 ]
How is it, beloved, that your eyes

In the very height of love's scorching
fever, she abhors, strangely enough, the
cooling unctuous sandal, the cool rays
of the moon and the cool breeze from
the lotus pond wafting the scent from
the neighboming flowery thickets; her
agony is indeed aggravated thousand-
fold by these cooling medicaments. More
strangely still; in the secret recesses of
her heart, she fondly dotes on the cool
delight that thy limbs alone can engender
through soft caresses ; and thus nouri-
shing herself with the feeble hope of[ 2235
clasping thy form again to her bosom,
she clings, though for a moment only,
fast to life. (S. Lakshminarasimha Sastri).

teeth of women of the KariJata country,
pierced by the sharp glances of the

arms of the women of the Uita country and
threatened by the index finger of the
Malaya women, the poet Ra:jasekhara
now seeks for Va:ral).asi. (SUryakanta).

On cushions scattered with flowers
and spread with a coverlet sprinkled with
camphor water and wet lotus leaves, the
two (Nala and Damayanti) were tossing
from one side to the other, in their
separate beds ; to Damayanti with eyes
devoid of delight (in anything) such was
the pitiable state ; to them both sandal
and moonlight, mass of campaka-flowers,
etc. were behaving like fire (in enhancing
the fever of love). (A. A. R.).

The rays of the cool-rayed moon

become camphor-dust on the ground, be-
come white lilies in lakes all of a sudden,
act as waves of the Ganges in the sky,

Knowledge without action is similar
to a lame person; nothing is secured by
this and nothing is accomplished.
Similarly, action without knowledge is
similar to a blind man ; neither the path
nor the aim of the action is discerned by
him.
When one acts concertedly through
body, mind and speech, the desired
result is produ.ced in all harmony.

One, even if born in a noble family,
is learned, has many a virtue, deserves
respect and is wise, will be lost, if caught
by passion. He does undesirable things,
comes under another's control, has no
sense of shame when moving among the
people, does not understand righteousness
and misconduct, leaves the teacher's place,
and serves low people. Hence leave off
that enemy, passion, who is clever
in giving misery ; and then live (happily).

Thus, one distressed by the ·results of

woods of worldly life just as a blind man

The action done :in a previous birth,
whether good or bad, is called Fate ; that
merely results in birth in a good family;
modesty, goodness and the state of
deserving from boyhood onwards are the
results of good deeds done now ; .hence one
should exert oneself (in good deeds), as a
good harvest is the combined result of
human action and luck in life. (A. A. R.).

being bahuloha, (the oven being made of
much iron and the words of poets brimming
with suggestions) ; it is like the dawn,
both being sumilita-cakra, (the oven being
held tight by rings round it and the dawn
with the encircling horizon, cakravala);
it is also like the body of Siva, both
being hasanti (the oven having the
appellation of hasanti and Siva rippling
with laughter). (K. V. Sarma).

Oh heroic Simhabhupa, when your
enemy kings ( who had been captured
and later released by you, rejoin their
queens), begin to draw, in private, designs
with musk on the cheeks (of their queens),
they also inscribe on their bosoms your
epithets on account of their familiarity
thereof ( during their captivity ) ; at
this inadvertence, the chief queens of
the harem feel embarassed with shyness
which appears in the guise of the feeling
of being eo-wives of your sovereignty.

abode on Vi~Qu's chest, saluting you, I
wish to make a query, if you will not be
offended : Is the lotus, in which you
were born, merely your resting place or
your place of instruction, as well ? For,
(like the lotus whose stalk goes down into
the mud), you seem to descend from a
low level to a still lower level (so far
as I am concerned). Is it an account of
the teaching ? . (K. V. Sarma).

Thrusting aside the cuckoo a crow
sits on a mango tree and enjoys its fruits ;.
an osprey, preventing a royal parrot,
sportively consumes the seeds of the pome-

sleeps comfortably on the tree top with
his wife ; alas ! everything is topsy turvy

If a crow, by the power of his wings,
takes hold of the food (intended for a
lion) in the king's palace, does it denote
any greatness in him ? Or does a slight
come to the I ion who attacks a mighty
elephant and tearing its temples sportively
obtains the best of food if it throws away
clusters of pearls as if they were (worth-

A crow, though fickle by nature, is
of nob1e conduct, for, when if gets an
oblation it calls its own kith and kin and
others, too ; but a dog, of mean nature,
when it gets the carcass even of an entire
elephant, its skin, bones and flesh, hates
others to share the food and attacks any
(who happens to come). (K. V. Sarma).

mity : While one was beset with mens-
trual impurity and had her moon-like face
bedimmed, thereby resembling the atmos·

of coming trouble), others devoid of all
splendour and their minds unsteady under
the fire of the pangs of separation resem-
bled the quarters, dull and amazing all

A female dove said to her mate in
sorrowful tones, 'My dear, our end is
now near, for under the tree there is a
hunter with arrow ready on the bow, and
above us wheels round a hawk.' Suddenly
a snake bit the hunter and the dis-
charged arrow, ( missing aim ), killed
the hawk. The two (enemies) went in a
trice to the abode of the God of Death ;
Strange is the way of destiny. (A. A. R.).

This son of Kusika, now in wrath, will
also do to you the same as did wrathful
Siva by his glance on seeing Cupid with
a drawn bow, -Siva whose face became
dreadful with a fierce frown appearing on
the playful break of mature meditation,
even though he could be full of love-
play with his beloved, and even though
he was dispassionate and tranquil on

who has been denied an embrace of his

created by Lord Brahmiii for that very
purpose ; but great is the pity that the

When the beloved was completely
engrossed in novel ways of love sports even
at a strange place (rendezvous), the deer-
eyed one was cooing in such a manner
in the ecstasy of the moment that flocks
of quails came round her couch and
began to coo in response [ mistaking her
coo to be from one of their own kind].
(A. A. R.).
When the errant lover now touched
her bodice, she craned her neck and
released a flood of cruel looks like the
arrows of Cupid who was red with anger;
then, significantly she laughed gently

As an errant husband approached
the (offended) sweetheart, she rebuked
him with hot words of anger, and
stared at him again and again with
side-glances, with eyebrows knit ; she
then tied him up with her girdle and
with the blue lotus, which she sported,
beat him hard on his forehead stained
with the red lac from the lotus-feet
of her eo-wife. (K. V. Sarma).

Betel stimulates love, sets off the
countenance, i·ugratiates, gives fragrance
to the mouth, is tonic, quells phlegmatic
diseases and is productive of yet other
advantages.
Used with a moderate dose of lime,
it gives colour ; with too excessive a dose
of areca-nut, it destroys colour ; with
too much lime, it gives a bad smell to
the mouth, but when the betel·leaf pre-
dominates, a pleasant smell.
At night a quid of betel is salutary,
if it consists chiefly of leaf, and at day-
time, if it is mixed with lime ; to apply
betel in any other fashion than those
__ a..._.[ 2467
here prescribed is a mere abuse of it.
When the fragrance of betel is enhanced
by kakkola, Areca, Averrhoa and Eny-
thrine, it awakens the joys of amorous
intoxication. (H. Kern).

supplies of elixir vitae, for flying on the

Those people, who perform motive-
oriented actions [such as sacrifices] which
give but limited results such as (the
temporary) heaven and which greatly
delude their inner spirits, do not under-
stand the bliss of the absolute that cannot
be known by any other means (than
through Vedanta) and which is never
circumscribed by limitations. Does the
seller of salt ever understand the great
value of camphor ? (A. A. R.).

Version A :
One having a false doctrine in his heart
will not realize the form of Lord Siva at
Ka~i.
That goddess who is dear to him
should be propitiated as though she were
Sri [wealth]. If you have your mind ,ever
delighting in him (Siva) it is the result of
abundant good deeds done formerly.
Hence when worshipping him your mind
is indifferent even to the bliss of oneness
with Brahman.
Version B :
Which young woman does not obtain
the pleasures of love when her mind is
set on lying on the breast of her husband ?
She is dear to him as Lak~mi is to Lord
Vi$QU, for she is superior to other wives.
Innumerable are your virtues in as much
as your mind is always on enjoyment with
her. When making love to her your
n1ind is indifferent even to the bliss of
oneness with Brahman. (A. A. R.).

Riddle.
The cave asks, 'Who am I ?' 'What is
the answer to this question ?' 'How do you
not grasp when it is already stated.
You trouble me, 0 friend ?' [ In kadar-
thayasi the syllables lea and thayas are to
be deleted : what remains is dari (cave)].
(A. A. R.).
About what should one think day and
night ? About the essence of the cycle of
existence, but not about woman. What
should one take as a beloved ? Compa-
ssion, kindness and good will.
