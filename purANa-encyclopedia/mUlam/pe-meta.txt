This file describes the coding conventions of the data files.
This file is encoded in utf-8 encoding.

The original digitization is file pe_orig.txt, which is
coded in the cp1252 (windows 1252) encoding,
and is best viewed in a text editor which supports this encoding.
For example, in Emacs, one may use the command
revert-buffer-with-coding-system
and then select cp1252 as the coding.
The internet reference http://www.cp1252.com/ describes this coding system.

The file pe_orig_utf8.txt is a conversion of pe_orig.txt to the
more common utf-8 encoding.
(April 2, 2015) The file pe_orig_utf8_slp1.txt contains the same data, but
  has Devanagari coded in SLP1 transliteration.  It is the basis of further
  corrections.
The file pe.txt is also in the utf-8 encoding, and incorporates various
editing changes, such as corrections of typographical errors.

There are several extended ascii codes occurring in pe.txt:
¤  (\u00a4)     1 := CURRENCY SIGN
½  (\u00bd)     1 := VULGAR FRACTION ONE HALF
×  (\u00d7)     4 := MULTIPLICATION SIGN
‘  (\u2018)   896 := LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
’  (\u2019)   892 := RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
“  (\u201c)  2046 := LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
”  (\u201d)  1951 := RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}   26 : {#X#} devanagari text, coded with HK (after some Letters)
             (April 2, 2015) X coded as SLP1
{@X@}    2 : bold text
{%X%} 3408 : italic text 
{??}    19 : unreadable text

The <> style of coding is used as follows:
<F>...</F>  101 : Footnote
<Poem>...</Poem> 118 : Poem
<>   96356 : Line break
<HI>  8805 : Headword
<NI> 10510 : Subsection
<H>     27 : Title (letter breaks)
<P>      8 : Paragraph
<C10>    6  :  Table Column marker
<C11>    1  :  Table Column marker
<C12>    1  :  Table Column marker
<C1>   635  :  Table Column marker
<C2>   563  :  Table Column marker
<C3>   245  :  Table Column marker
<C4>   101  :  Table Column marker
<C5>    63  :  Table Column marker
<C6>    29  :  Table Column marker
<C7>    19  :  Table Column marker
<C8>     7  :  Table Column marker
<C9>     7  :  Table Column marker



Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
There are two forms.
First form:
[PagePPP-C+ n] where PPP is page number from 001 to 900,
               and C is column (a or b)
Second form:
[PagePPP+ n]  PPP = 901 to 922 (single column material)
 

Headword coding is exemplified by: <HI>ABHAYAM.
Here is the regular expression used in python programs to recognize headwords:
reHeadword = r'<HI>([A-Z][A-Z1-9]*)'
 The first group is key1; it is coded with AS (and in all capital letters)

The headwords are ordered according to Sanskrit alphabet ordering.


Most Sanskrit in the text appears in the European Indological form, which is
coded in pe.txt with the the AS (Anglicized Sanskrit) coding.

The general AS scheme, as described in CDSL.pdf, uses Latin alphabetical
letters 'x (a-z,A-Z), possibly with suffixed numbers; the letter-number
combinations are, in the general scheme:
x1 = macron
x2 = dot below
x3 = dot above
x4 = accent aigu
x5 = tilde
x6 = dash below
x7 = umlaut
x10 = circonflex (hat)
x11 = accent grave

Here are the characters that occur in pe.txt in this coding,
with their approximate frequency:
