##this is a big update, and so kept in testing folder
##after resolving all issues (if any) , will mix back to normal.

UPDATE:
-----------------------------------------
1. All same things, which are in normal version,, till kannada headwords,, rutvaam patches, etc.

2. Now numeral appended lists will not come when you searched word even in devanagari. like
   aja 01 , aja 02 etc.. will not come in results, but only common entry will come.
   but display will contain that numeral as in previous version. that is preserved.

.. main thing is, till now we cannot view all words of a page number in one view.
   And hense we cannot get environment of word or, cannot replicate book, or 
   we cannot browse or navigate through book,pages.Only searching for a word is possible.

3. So to solve above problem, page number of every word added in their head words
   so,, if we search for a page number, we can get that page words at one place!!!.
   like  search for 'p198' and get words in that page. Remember,  append  'p' before
   page number.

4. But above soln again has problem, as golden dict sorts multiple results in alphabetical
   order, in this case sorts according hindi alphabetical order, but actual  words in that 
   page sorted in english like order.  even not  enlish  order,  due to iaSt  letters.
   to solve this, that word number in that page  appended beforee head word,  and now
   it just looks like in book.

5. At end of every last word of a page,, added links  to next  page and previous, and 
    hense  you  can just turn pages,, withh  out  searching.  Just check  it  , it is
   too conviniennt.

6. any of these features doesn't affect previous merits :),, for example check 'p33'.
