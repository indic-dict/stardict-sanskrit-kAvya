<u>'''1. Akṣa,'''</u> ‘axle,’ is a part of a chariot often referred to in the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_4/> and later. It was apparently<ref name=fx2_ve1_4/> fastened to the body of the chariot ('''[[कोश|Kośa]]''') by straps (''akṣā-nah,'' lit. ‘tied to the axle,’ though this word is also<ref name=fx3_ve1_4/> rendered ‘horse’). The heating of the axle and the danger of its breaking were known.<ref name=fx4_ve1_4/> The part of the axle round which the nave of the wheel revolved was called [[आणि|Āṇi]], ‘pin.’ <br>

<u>'''2. Akṣa.'''</u>--This word occurs frequently, from the Rigveda onwards, both in the singular and plural, meaning ‘die’ and ‘dice.’ Dicing, along with horse-racing, was one of the main amusements of the Vedic Indian; but, despite the frequent mention of the game in the literature, there is considerable difficulty in obtaining any clear picture of the mode in which it was played.<br><br>(1) ''The Material.''--The dice appear normally to have been made of Vibhīdaka nuts. Such dice are alluded to in both the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_5/> and the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx2_ve1_5/> hence being called ‘brown’ (''[[बभ्रु|babhru]]''), and ‘born on a windy spot.’<ref name=fx3_ve1_5/> In the ritual game of dice at the Agnyādheya and the [[राजसूय|Rājasūya]] ceremonies the material of the dice is not specified, but it is possible that occasionally gold imitations of Vibhīdaka nuts were used.<ref name=fx4_ve1_5/> There is no clear trace in the Vedic literature of the later use of cowries as dice.<ref name=fx5_ve1_5/><br><br>(2) ''The Number.''--In the Rigveda<ref name=fx6_ve1_5/> the dicer is described as ‘leader of a great horde’ (''senānīr mahato gaṇasya''), and in another passage<ref name=fx7_ve1_5/> the number is given as ''tri-pañcāśaḥ,'' an expression which has been variously interpreted. Ludwig,<ref name=fx8_ve1_5/> Weber,<ref name=fx9_ve1_5/> and Zimmer<ref name=fx10_ve1_5/> render it as fifteen, which is grammatically hardly possible. Roth<ref name=fx11_ve1_5/> and Grassmann<ref name=fx12_ve1_5/> render it as ‘consisting of fifty-three.’ Lüders<ref name=fx13_ve1_5/> takes it as ‘consisting of one hundred and fifty,’ but he points out that this may be merely a vague expression for a large number. For a small number Zimmer<ref name=fx14_ve1_5/> cites a reference in the Rigveda<ref name=fx15_ve1_5/> to one who fears ‘him who holds four’ (''caturaś cid dadamānāt''), but the sense of that passage is dependent on the view taken of the method of playing the game.<br><br>(3) ''The Method of Play.''--In several passages of the later  Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas lists are given of expressions connected with dicing. The names are [[कृत|Kṛta]], Tretā, [[द्वापर|Dvāpara]], Āskanda, and Abhibhū in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā.<ref name=fx16_ve1_5/> In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx17_ve1_5/> among the victims at the Puruṣamedha, the ''[[कितव|kitava]]'' is offered to the Akṣarāja, the ''ādinava-[[दर्श|darśa]]'' to the [[कृत|Kṛta]], the ''kalpin'' to the Tretā, the ''adhi-kalpin'' to the [[द्वापर|Dvāpara]], the ''[[सभा-स्थाणु|sabhā-sthāṇu]]'' to the Āskanda. The lists in the parallel version of the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] are ''[[कितव|kitava]], [[सभाविन्|sabhāvin]], ādinavadarśa, bahiḥ-sad,'' and ''[[सभा-स्थाणु|sabhā-sthāṇu]],''<ref name=fx18_ve1_5/> and Aksarāja, [[कृत|Kṛta]], Tretā, [[द्वापर|Dvāpara]], and Kali. From the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx19_ve1_5/> it appears that another name of Kali was Abhibhū, and the parallel lists in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās suggest that Abhibhū and Akṣarāja are identical, though both appear in the late [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] list. The names of some of these throws go back even to the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda. Kali occurs in the latter,<ref name=fx20_ve1_5/> and Lüders<ref name=fx21_ve1_5/> shows that in a considerable number of passages in the former [[कृत|Kṛta]] means a ‘throw’ (not ‘a stake’<ref name=fx22_ve1_5/> or ‘what is won’<ref name=fx23_ve1_5/> and this sense is clearly found in the Atharvaveda.<ref name=fx24_ve1_5/> Moreover, that there were more throws (''ayāḥ'') than one is proved by a passage in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx25_ve1_5/> when the gods are compared to throws as giving or destroying wealth.<br><br>The nature of the throws is obscure. The St. Petersburg Dictionary conjectures that the names given above were applied either to dice marked 4, 3, 2, or 1, or to the sides of the dice so marked, and the latter interpretation is supported by some late commentators.<ref name=fx26_ve1_5/> But there is no evidence for the former interpretation, and, as regards the latter, the shape of the Vibhīdaka nuts,<ref name=fx27_ve1_5/> used as dice, forbids any side being properly on the top. Light is thrown on the expressions by the descrip-  tion of a ritual game<ref name=fx28_ve1_5/> at the Agnyādheya and at the [[राजसूय|Rājasūya]] ceremonies. The details are not certain,<ref name=fx29_ve1_5/> but it is clear that the game consisted in securing even numbers of dice, usually a number divisible by four, the [[कृत|Kṛta]], the other three throws then being the Tretā, when three remained over after division by four; the [[द्वापर|Dvāpara]], when two was the remainder; and the Kali, when one remained. If five were the dividing number, then the throw which showed no remainder was Kali, the [[कृत|Kṛta]] was that when four was left, and so on. The dice had no numerals marked on them, the only question being what was the total number of the dice themselves.<br><br>There is no reason to doubt that the game as played in the Rigveda was based on the same principle, though the details must remain doubtful. The number of dice used was certainly large,<ref name=fx30_ve1_5/> and the reference to throwing fours,<ref name=fx31_ve1_5/> and losing by one, points to the use of the [[कृत|Kṛta]] as the winning throw. The Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx32_ve1_5/> on the other hand, possibly knew of the Kali as the winning throw. In one respect the ordinary game must have differed from the ritual game. In the latter the players merely pick out the number of dice required--no doubt to avoid ominous errors, such as must have happened if a real game had been played. In the secular game the dice were thrown,<ref name=fx33_ve1_5/> perhaps on the principle suggested by Lüders:<ref name=fx34_ve1_5/> the one throwing a certain number on the place of playing, and the other then throwing a number to make up with those already thrown a multiple of four or five. This theory, at any rate, accounts for the later stress laid on the power of computation in a player, as in the Nala.<br><br>No board appears to have been used, but a depression on which  the dice were thrown (''[[अधि-देवन|adhi-devana]], [[देवन|devana]],''<ref name=fx35_ve1_5/> ''[[इरिण|iriṇa]]''<ref name=fx36_ve1_5/> ), was made in the ground. No dice box was used, but reference is made to a case for keeping dice in (''[[अक्ष|akṣa]]-[[वपन|vapana]]''<ref name=fx37_ve1_5/> The throw was called ''[[ग्रह|graha]]''<ref name=fx38_ve1_5/> or earlier ''[[ग्राभ|grābha]].''<ref name=fx39_ve1_5/> The stake is called ''vij.''<ref name=fx40_ve1_5/> Serious losses could be made at dicing: in the Rigveda a dicer laments the loss of all his property, including his wife.<ref name=fx41_ve1_5/> Lüders<ref name=fx42_ve1_5/> finds a different form of the game referred to in the Chāndogya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]].<ref name=fx43_ve1_5/><br>

<u>'''3. Akṣa.'''</u>--In the Chāndogya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]] (vii. 3, 1) this word seems to denote the nut of the Vibhīdaka (''Terminalia bellerica'').<br>

अक्षत|akṣata|akShata|అక్షత|ಅಕ್ಷತ|axata|_vei1@7|_vei1_pn5
<u>'''Akṣata'''</u> or '''Akṣita.'''--In one passage of the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx1_ve1_7/> dealing with the '''[[जायान्य|Jāyānya]],''' mention is made of a remedy for sores designated both Akṣita and Sukṣata, or, according to the reading of the Kauṣika [[सूत्र|Sūtra]], [[अक्षत|Akṣata]] and Sukṣata, while Sāyaṇa has Akṣita and Sukṣita. Bloomfield<ref name=fx2_ve1_7/> renders ‘not caused by cutting’ and ‘caused by cutting.’ Formerly<ref name=fx3_ve1_7/> he suggested ‘tumour’ or ‘boil.’ Whitney<ref name=fx4_ve1_7/> thinks that two varieties of [[जायान्य|Jāyānya]] are meant. Ludwig<ref name=fx5_ve1_7/> reads with Sāyana ''akṣita,'' which he renders by ‘not firmly established’ in the invalid. Zimmer<ref name=fx6_ve1_7/> finds in it a disease [[क्षत|Kṣata]]. <br>

अक्षु|akṣu|akShu|అక్షు|ಅಕ್ಷು|axu|_vei1@9|_vei1_pn6
<u>'''Akṣu.'''</u>--The word occurs in two passages of the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_9/> and one of the Rigveda.<ref name=fx2_ve1_9/> Roth<ref name=fx3_ve1_9/> renders it by ‘net,’ while Bo7htlingk<ref name=fx4_ve1_9/> suggests ‘axle of a car.’ Geldner<ref name=fx5_ve1_9/> sees in it a stake or pole used with a fishermen's net ('''[[जाल|Jāla]]'''),<ref name=fx6_ve1_9/> the pole of a wagon,<ref name=fx7_ve1_9/> and the pole of a house, whether vertical or horizontal, he leaves uncertain (see '''[[वंश|Vaṃśa]]''').<ref name=fx8_ve1_9/> Bloomfield<ref name=fx9_ve1_9/> takes it as a covering of wickerwork stretched across a beam and sloping down to both sides--like a thatched roof, and this best explains the epithet ‘thousand-eyed’ (''i.e.,'' with countless holes) ascribed to it. In the other Atharvaveda passage<ref name=fx10_ve1_9/> he accepts the sense ‘net,’ and doubts if the word in the Rigveda is not an adjective (''a-kṣu'') as it is taken by Sāyaṇa.

अगस्त्य|agastya|అగస్త్య|ಅಗಸ್ತ್ಯ|_vei1@11|_vei1_pn6
<u>'''Agastya.'''</u>--This is the name of a sage, of mythical character, who plays a great part in the later literature. He was a '''[[मान|Māna]],'''<ref name=fx1_ve1_11/> and therefore is called '''[[मान्य|Mānya]]'''<ref name=fx2_ve1_11/> and son of [[मान|Māna]], and only once is there a reference<ref name=fx3_ve1_11/> to the legend prevalent in latter times that he was a son of [[मित्र|Mitra]] and Varuṇa.<br><br>His greatest feat was the reconciliation of Indra and the Maruts after Indra had been annoyed at his proposing to give the Maruts an offering to the exclusion of Indra. This feat is the subject of three hymns of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx4_ve1_11/> and is often referred  to in the Brāhmaṇas,<ref name=fx5_ve1_11/> though the exact details and significance of the legend are variously treated by Oldenberg,<ref name=fx6_ve1_11/> Sieg,<ref name=fx7_ve1_11/> Hertel,<ref name=fx8_ve1_11/> and von Schroeder.<ref name=fx9_ve1_11/><br><br>He also appears in a strange dialogue with [[लोपामुद्रा|Lopāmudrā]] in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx10_ve1_11/> which appears to show him as an ascetic who finally yields to temptation.

Sāyaṇa holds that be was the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] of '''[[खेल|Khela]],''' and Sieg<ref name=fx13_ve1_11/> accepts this view, while Pischel<ref name=fx14_ve1_11/> thinks that [[खेल|Khela]] is a deity, Vivasvant.<br><br>Geldner<ref name=fx15_ve1_11/> shows from the Rigveda<ref name=fx16_ve1_11/> that [[अगस्त्य|Agastya]], as brother of [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]]--both being miraculous sons of [[मित्र|Mitra]] and Varuṇa-introduces '''[[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]]''' to the '''Tṛtsus.''' There are two other references to [[अगस्त्य|Agastya]] in the Rigveda, the one<ref name=fx17_ve1_11/> including him in a long list of persons, the other alluding to his sister's sons (''nadbhyaḥ''),<ref name=fx18_ve1_11/> apparently '''[[बन्धु|Bandhu]],''' etc. In the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx19_ve1_11/> he appears as connected with witchcraft, and in a long list of sages.<ref name=fx20_ve1_11/> In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<ref name=fx21_ve1_11/> cows, with a peculiar mark on their ears (''viṣṭya-karṇyaḥ''), are associated with him.<br>

<u>'''Agni-dagdha.'''</u>--This epithet (‘burnt with fire’)<ref name=fx1_ve1_13/> applies to the dead who were burned on the funeral pyre. This is one of the two normal methods of disposing of the dead, the other being burial (''an-agnidagdhāḥ,'' ‘not burnt with fire’).<ref name=fx2_ve1_13/> The Atharvaveda<ref name=fx3_ve1_13/> adds two further modes of disposal to those-viz., casting out (''paroptāḥ''), and the exposure of the dead (''uddhitāḥ''). The exact sense of these expressions is doubtful. Zimmer<ref name=fx4_ve1_13/> considers that the former is a parallel to the Iranian practice of casting out the dead to be devoured by beasts, and that the latter refers to the old who are exposed when helpless.<ref name=fx5_ve1_13/> Whitney<ref name=fx6_ve1_13/> refers the latter expression to the exposure of the dead body on a raised platform of some sort.<br><br>Burial was clearly not rare in the Rigvedic period: a whole hymn<ref name=fx7_ve1_13/> describes the ritual attending it. The dead man was buried apparently in full attire, with his bow in his hand, and probably at one time his wife was immolated to accompany him, in accordance with a practice common among savage tribes. But in the Vedic period both customs appear in a modified form: the son takes the bow from the hand of the dead man, and the widow is led away from her dead husband by his brother or other nearest kinsman. A stone is set between the dead and the living to separate them. In the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx8_ve1_13/> but not in the Rigveda, a coffin (''[[वृक्ष|vṛkṣa]]'') is alluded to. In both Saṃhitās<ref name=fx9_ve1_13/> occur other allusions to the ‘house of earth’ (''[[भूमि|bhūmi]]-[[गृह|gṛha]]''). To remove the apparent discrepancy between burning and burial, by assuming that the references to burial are to the burial of the burned bones, as does Oldenberg,<ref name=fx10_ve1_13/> is unnecessary and improbable, as burning and burial subsisted side by side in Greece for many years.<br><br>Burning was, however, equally usual, and it grew steadily in frequency, for in the Chāndogya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]]<ref name=fx11_ve1_13/> the adornment  of the body of the dead with curd ('''[[आमिक्षा|Āmikṣā]]'''), clothes, and ornaments, in order to win the next world, is referred to as something erroneous and wrong, and in the funeral Mantras of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<ref name=fx12_ve1_13/> only burning seems to be contemplated; the verses which refer to burial here really alluding to the burial of the ashes in the burying-ground (''[[श्मशान|śmaśāna]]'').<ref name=fx13_ve1_13/> The body was wrapped in fat,<ref name=fx14_ve1_13/> as we learn from the funeral hymn in the Rigveda, a goat being apparently burned with it,<ref name=fx15_ve1_13/> to act as a guide on the way to the next world. According to the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx16_ve1_13/> a draft-ox was burned presumably for the dead to ride with in the next world. It was expected that the dead would revive with his whole body and all his limbs (''sarva-tanūḥ sāṅgaḥ''),<ref name=fx17_ve1_13/> although it is also said<ref name=fx18_ve1_13/> that the eye goes to the sun, the breath to the wind, and so forth.<br><br>Before burial or burning, the corpse was washed,<ref name=fx19_ve1_13/> a clog (''[[कूदी|kūdī]]'') being tied to the foot to prevent the deceased returning to earth.<ref name=fx20_ve1_13/><br>

<u>'''Agni-śāla.'''</u>--This term, which designates part of the sacrificial  apparatus,<ref name=fx1_ve1_15/> is applied in the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx2_ve1_15/> to a part of an ordinary house, presumably the central hall where the fireplace was.<br>

The Atharvaveda<ref name=fx2_ve1_16/> has the ordinary '''[[मघास्|Maghās]]''' instead. It is impossible to resist the conclusion that the reading of the Rigveda was deliberately altered because of the connection of the slaughter of kine with sin (''agha'')--possibly, too, with a further desire to emphasize the contrast with ''[[अघ्न्या|aghnyā]],'' a name for ‘cow.’ Moreover, in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx3_ve1_16/> occurs the formula ‘Svāhā to the [[मघास्|Maghās]], Svāhā to the Anaghās.’ See also '''[[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]].'''<br>

The meaning of these terms is quite obscure. The commentators refer them to the sides or wheels. Zimmer<ref name=fx3_ve1_19/> compares the Greek <ref name=fx4_ve1_19/> and thinks that the Aṅkau were the upper border of the body of the chariot (''[[कोश|kośa]], [[वन्धुर|vandhura]]''), and the Nyaṅkau the lower rims for greater security. Oldenberg<ref name=fx5_ve1_19/> confesses that the exact sense is impossible to make out, but considers that the terms at once refer to parts of the chariot and to divinities, while Bo7htlingk<ref name=fx6_ve1_19/> takes the term as referring to divinities alone. <br>

When [[वासिष्ठ|Vāsiṣṭha]] reminded him of his indebtedness, and claimed a great reward, the warrior replied irascibly that he intended to conquer the '''Uttara Kurus,''' and that [[वासिष्ठ|Vāsiṣṭha]] would then become King of the Earth, Atyarāti himself being his general (''[[सेना|senā]]-pati''). [[वासिष्ठ|Vāsiṣṭha]] replied that as no mortal man could conquer the Uttara Kurus he was cheated of his reward.

<u>'''Atharvāṅgirasaḥ.'''</u>--This is the collective name of the Atharvaveda in several passages<ref name=fx1_ve1_52/> of the later Brāhmaṇas. It occurs once in the Atharvaveda itself,<ref name=fx2_ve1_52/> while the term Atharvaveda is not found before the [[सूत्र|Sūtra]] period.<ref name=fx3_ve1_52/> The compound seems, according to Bloomfield,<ref name=fx4_ve1_52/> to denote the two elements which make up the Atharvaveda.

<u>'''Adhi-rāja.'''</u>--The word occurs fairly often throughout the early literature,<ref name=fx1_ve1_57/> denoting ‘overlord’ among kings or princes.  In no passage is it clear that a real over-king is meant, as the word ''[[राजन्|rājan]]'' may mean king or merely prince, a person of royal blood. On the whole it seems most probable that the word connotes no more than ‘king’ as opposed to ‘prince.’<br>

<u>'''Adhi-ṣavaṇa.'''</u>--The two Adhiṣavaṇas<ref name=fx1_ve1_58/> are usually understood, as by Roth<ref name=fx2_ve1_58/> and Zimmer,<ref name=fx3_ve1_58/> to designate the two boards between which the Soma was pressed. Hillebrandt,<ref name=fx4_ve1_58/> however, shows from the ritual that the boards were not placed one over the other, but were placed one behind the other, the two serving as a foundation upon which the Soma was pressed by a stone. This theory seems to account best for the etymological sense of the name ‘over-press,’ as well as for the use of the word as an adjective (‘used for pressing ''upon''’). But according to the procedure as witnessed by Haug<ref name=fx5_ve1_58/> in the Deccan, the shoots of the plant are first placed on the skin, one of the boards being then laid over them and pounded with a stone. The shoots are then taken out and placed upon the board, the second board being then laid over them.<br>

<u>'''Ayas.'''</u>--The exact metal denoted by this word when used by itself, as always in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx1_ve1_119/> is uncertain. As favouring the sense of ‘bronze’ rather than that of ‘iron’ may perhaps be cited with Zimmer<ref name=fx2_ve1_119/> the fact that Agni is called ''ayo-[[दंष्ट्र|daṃṣṭra]],'' ‘with teeth of Ayas,’<ref name=fx3_ve1_119/> with reference to the colour of his flames, and that the car-seat of [[मित्र|Mitra]] and Varuṇa is called ''ayaḥ-sthūṇa,''<ref name=fx4_ve1_119/> ‘with pillars of Ayas’ at the setting of the sun.<ref name=fx5_ve1_119/> Moreover, in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx6_ve1_119/> Ayas is enumerated in a list of six metals: gold (''[[हिरण्य|hiraṇya]]''), Ayas, [[श्याम|Śyāma]], Loha, lead (''[[सीस|sīsa]]''), tin (''[[त्रपु|trapu]]''). Here ''[[श्याम|śyāma]]'' (‘swarthy’) and ''loha'' (‘red’) must mean ‘iron’ and ‘copper’ respectively; ''ayas'' would therefore seem to mean ‘bronze.’ In many passages in the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx7_ve1_119/> and  other books, the Ayas is divided into two species--the ''[[श्याम|śyāma]]'' (‘iron’) and the ''[[लोहित|lohita]]'' (‘copper’ or ‘bronze’). In the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx8_ve1_119/> a distinction is drawn between Ayas and ''[[लोहायस|lohāyasa]],'' which may either be a distinction between iron and copper as understood by Eggeling,<ref name=fx9_ve1_119/> or between copper and bronze as held by Schrader.<ref name=fx10_ve1_119/> In one passage of the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx11_ve1_119/> the sense of iron seems certain.

Copper is '''[[लोहायस|Lohāyasa]]''' or '''[[लोहितायस|Lohitāyasa]].'''<br><br>The smelting (''dhmā'' ‘to blow’) of the metal is frequently referred to.

Geldner,<ref name=fx1_ve1_145/> indeed, contends that no other sense is anywhere needed; but Roth<ref name=fx2_ve1_145/> and Zimmer<ref name=fx3_ve1_145/> agree in thinking that in several passages of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<ref name=fx4_ve1_145/> the word has the same sense as '''[[आर्य|Ārya]],''' and this appears probable. Whether it is necessary to ascribe this sense to the word in the compound ''arya-[[पत्नी|patnī]]''<ref name=fx5_ve1_145/> applied to the waters set free by Indra, is more doubtful. The commentator, Mahīdhara,<ref name=fx6_ve1_145/> suggests that the word means a '''[[वैश्य|Vaiśya]],''' not an '''[[आर्य|Ārya]]''' generally.

<u>'''Aṣṭa-karṇī'''</u> is an expression which occurs in one passage of the Ṛigveda,<ref name=fx1_ve1_189/> and which Roth<ref name=fx2_ve1_189/> was at first inclined to interpret  as a proper name. There can, however, be no doubt that it means a cow, not a man, as suggested by Grassmann. The exact reason why a cow should be so described is uncertain. Roth<ref name=fx3_ve1_189/> was later inclined to see in it the sense ‘having pierced ears,’ similar epithets being at a later period known to Pāṇini<ref name=fx4_ve1_189/> (''bhinna-karṇa, chinna-karṇa''). Grassmann's more obvious rendering, ‘having the sign for (the number) 8 marked on the ear,’ is supported by the similar epithets, ‘having the mark of a lute on the ear’ (''[[कर्करि|karkari]]-karṇyaḥ''), ‘having the mark of a sickle on the ear’ (''[[दात्र|dātra]]-karṇyaḥ''), ‘having the mark of a stake on the ear’ (''sthūṇākarṇyaḥ''), ‘having the ears bored’ (''chidra-karṇyaḥ''), and ''viṣtyakarṇyaḥ,'' given in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.<ref name=fx5_ve1_189/> The simple meaning, ‘with marked ears,’ is, however, supported by the same passage of the Maitrāyaṇī, where the verb ''akṣ'' occurs in the sense ‘to mark.’ In the Atharvaveda the mark used is the Mithuna, no doubt as a magical device to secure fertility.<br><br>The marking of ears was apparently a regular practice. It is twice referred to in the Atharvaveda.<ref name=fx6_ve1_189/> The mark is termed ''[[लक्ष्मन्|lakṣman]],''<ref name=fx7_ve1_189/> and was made with a copper-knife<ref name=fx8_ve1_189/> (''[[लोहित|lohita]]''). The Maitrayaṇī Saṃhitā<ref name=fx9_ve1_189/> forbids the use of an arrow-shaft (''[[तेजन|tejana]]''), or of iron, but permits that of a stem of sugar-cane (''[[इक्षु|ikṣu]]-kāṇḍa'') or copper.<br>

In the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx5_ve1_200/> the same series appears with ‘early’ (''[[प्रातर्|prātar]]'') and ‘evening’ (''sāyāhna'') substituted for the first and last members, while a shorter list gives ''[[प्रातर्|prātar]], [[संगव|saṃgava]], sāyam.'' In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<ref name=fx6_ve1_200/> there is the series ‘dawn’ ''(uṣas), [[संगव|saṃgava]], [[मध्यंदिन|madhyaṃdina]],'' and ''aparāhṇa.''<br><br>The morning is also, according to Zimmer, called ''[[अपि-शर्वर|api-śarvara]],''<ref name=fx7_ve1_200/> as the time when the dark is just past. It is named ''[[स्वसर|svasara]],''<ref name=fx8_ve1_200/> as the time when the cows are feeding, before the first milking at the ''[[संगव|saṃgava]],'' or when the birds are awakening.<ref name=fx9_ve1_200/> It is also called ''[[प्र-पित्व|pra-pitva]],''<ref name=fx10_ve1_200/> according to Zimmer.<ref name=fx11_ve1_200/> But Geldner<ref name=fx12_ve1_200/> points out that that term refers to the late midday, which also is called ''[[अपि-शर्वर|api-śarvara]],'' as bordering on the coming night, being the time when day is hastening to its close, as in a race. From another point of view, evening is called ''[[अभि-पित्व|abhi-pitva]],''<ref name=fx13_ve1_200/> the time when all come to rest. Or again, morning and evening are denoted as the dawning of the sun (''uditā sūryasya''), or its setting (''[[नि-म्रुच्|ni-mruc]]''). The midday is regularly ''madhyam ahnām,''<ref name=fx14_ve1_200/> ''madhye,''<ref name=fx15_ve1_200/> or ''[[मध्यंदिन|madhyaṃdina]]. [[संगव|Saṃgava]]''<ref name=fx16_ve1_200/> is the forenoon, between the early morning (''[[प्रातर्|prātar]]'') and midday (''[[मध्यंदिन|madhyaṃdina]]'').<br><br>The divisions of time less than the day are seldom precisely given. In the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx17_ve1_200/> however, a day and  night make up 30 ''muhūrtas;'' 1 ''[[मुहूर्त|muhūrta]]'' = 15 ''kṣipra;'' 1 ''kṣipra'' = 15 ''etarhi;'' 1 ''etarhi'' = 15 ''idāni;'' 1 ''idāni'' = 15 breathings; 1 breathing = 1 spiration; 1 spiration = 1 twinkling (''nimeṣa''), etc. In the Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka<ref name=fx18_ve1_200/> the series is ''dhvaṃsayo, nimeṣāḥ, kāṣṭhāḥ, kalāḥ, kṣanā, muhūrtā, ahorātrāḥ.'' A thirtyfold division of day as well as of night is seen in one passage of the Rigveda<ref name=fx19_ve1_200/> by Zimmer, who compares the Babylonian sixtyfold division of the day and night. But the expression used-thirty Yojanas--is too vague and obscure--Bergaigne<ref name=fx20_ve1_200/> refers it to the firmament--to build any theory upon with safety.<br><br>The longer divisions of time are regularly ‘half month’ (''ardha-[[मास|māsa]]''), ‘month’ (''[[मास|māsa]]''), ‘season’ (''[[ऋतु|ṛtu]]''), and ‘year’ (''[[संवत्सर|saṃvatsara]]''), which often<ref name=fx21_ve1_200/> occur in this sequence after ''ahorātrāṇi'' (‘days and nights’).<br>

As the bow and arrow (''[[इषु|iṣu]], [[धन्वन्|dhanvan]]'') were essential as the main weapons of the Vedic fighter, they are probably meant when [[आयुध|Āyudha]] is used specifically of weapons, as often from the Rigveda<ref name=fx2_ve1_251/> onwards. The battle hymn in the Rigveda<ref name=fx3_ve1_251/> confirms this view, as it presents to us the warrior armed with bow and arrow on his chariot, and clad in armour ('''[[वर्मन्|Varman]]'''), with a guard ('''[[हस्तघ्न|Hastaghna]]''') on the left arm to avoid the friction of the bow-string. The corselet was not a single solid piece of metal, but consisted of many pieces fitted together (''syūta'');<ref name=fx4_ve1_251/> it may  have been made either of metal plates or, as is more likely, of some stiff material plated with metal.

Sometimes<ref name=fx4_ve1_265/> the expression is restricted to the [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] caste,  the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] and the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] receiving special designations; but this use is not common, and it is often uncertain also whether '''Arya''' is not meant. The phrase Śūdrāryau<ref name=fx5_ve1_265/> is especially ambiguous, but appears to have denoted originally the [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] and the Āryan, for in the Mahāvrata ceremony the fight between a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] and an [[आर्य|Ārya]] is represented in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] as one between a [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] and a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]], though the [[सूत्र|Sūtra]] treats it as a fight between a [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] and a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]].<br><br>The word [[आर्य|Ārya]] (fem. Āryā or Ārī) also occurs frequently used as an adjective to describe the Āryan classes (''viśaḥ''),<ref name=fx6_ve1_265/> or name (''[[नामन्|nāman]]''),<ref name=fx7_ve1_265/> or caste (''[[वर्ण|varṇa]]''),<ref name=fx8_ve1_265/> or dwellings (''[[धामन्|dhāman]]'');<ref name=fx9_ve1_265/> or again reference is made to the Āryan supremacy (''[[व्रत|vrata]]'')<ref name=fx10_ve1_265/> being extended over the land. Āryan foes (''vṛtra'')<ref name=fx11_ve1_265/> are referred to beside [[दास|Dāsa]] foes, and there are many<ref name=fx12_ve1_265/> references to war of Āryan versus Āryan, as well as to war of Āryan against [[दास|Dāsa]]. From this it can be fairly deduced that even by the time of the Rigveda the Āryan communities had advanced far beyond the stage of simple conquest of the aborigines. In the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas the wars alluded to seem mainly Āryan wars, no doubt in consequence of the fusion of [[आर्य|Ārya]] and [[दास|Dāsa]] into one community.<br><br>Weber<ref name=fx13_ve1_265/> considers that the five peoples known to the Rigveda were the Āryans and the four peoples of the quarters (''[[दिश्|diś]]'') of the earth, but this is doubtful.

Sāyaṇa, however, reads the accompanying word as ''[[शुशुक|śuśuka]],'' which he assumes to denote an animal. Bloomfield<ref name=fx3_ve1_279/> renders the two words ‘a swift (''[[आशुंग|āśuṃga]]'') foal (''[[शिशुक|śiśuka]]''),’ thus agreeing with one of Roth's suggestions in sense, though not in the explanation of Aśuṃga.<br>

<u>'''Ā-śrama'''</u> (‘resting-place’) does not occur in any [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]] which can be regarded as pre-Buddhistic. Its earliest use as denoting the stages of a Hindu's life is found in the Śvetāśvatara [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]].<ref name=fx1_ve1_280/> In one passage<ref name=fx2_ve1_280/> of the Chāndogya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]] reference is made only to the '''Brahmacārin''' and householder, to whom, as a reward for study, the procreation of children, the practice of Yoga, abstention from injury to living creatures, and sacrifices, freedom from transmigration are promised. In another place<ref name=fx3_ve1_280/> three states are contemplated, but not as consecutive. The Brahmacārin may either become a householder or become an anchorite, or remain in his teacher's house all his life. Similarly, reference<ref name=fx4_ve1_280/> is made to the death of the anchorite in the forest, or the sacrifice in the village. In contrast with all three<ref name=fx5_ve1_280/> is the man who stands fast in [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] (Brahmasaṃstha). In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]]<ref name=fx6_ve1_280/> the knower of the Ātman is contrasted with those who (1) study, or (2) sacrifice and give alms, or (3) are anchorites, and in another place<ref name=fx7_ve1_280/> with those who sacrifice and make benefactions, and those who practice asceticism. This position of superiority to, and distinction from, the Āśramas became later a fourth<ref name=fx8_ve1_280/> [[आश्रम|Āśrama]],  the '''Gṛhastha,''' or householder, who was in the second stage, being required to pass not only into the stage of '''Vānaprastha,''' but also that of the Sannyāsin ('''[[भिक्षु|Bhikṣu]], [[परिव्राजक|Parivrājaka]]'''). The first stage, that of the '''Brahmacārin,''' was still obligatory, but was no longer allowed to remain a permanent one, as was originally possible.<br><br>''Cf.''

In the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx3_ve1_293/> the settle brought for the '''[[व्रात्य|Vrātya]]''' is described at length. It had two feet, lengths wise and cross-pieces, forward and cross-cords, showing that it was made of wood and also cording. It was also covered with a cushion ('''[[आस्तरण|Āstaraṇa]]''') and a pillow ('''[[उपबर्हण|Upabarhaṇa]]'''), had a seat ('''[[आसाद|Āsāda]]''') and a support ('''Upaśraya'''). Similar seats are described in the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]]<ref name=fx4_ve1_293/> and the Jaiminīya [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx5_ve1_293/> The seat for the king at the royal consecration is described in very similar terms in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx6_ve1_293/> where the height of the feet is placed at a span, and the lengthwise and cross-pieces are each to be a cubit, while the interwoven part (''[[विवयन|vivayana]]'') is to be of [[मुञ्ज|Muñja]] grass, and the seat of [[उदुम्बर|Udumbara]] wood. In another passage of the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx7_ve1_293/> Lanman seems to take the seat meant as a ‘long reclining chair.’ There also a cushion ('''[[उपधान|Upadhāna]]''') and coverlet ('''Upavāsana''') are mentioned.

At the [[सौत्रामणी|Sautrāmaṇī]] rite<ref name=fx9_ve1_293/> (an Indra sacrifice) the seat is of [[उदुम्बर|Udumbara]] wood, is knee-high, and of unlimited width and depth, and is covered with plaited reed-work. The  imperial seat<ref name=fx10_ve1_293/> is to be shoulder-high, of [[उदुम्बर|Udumbara]] wood, and wound all over with cords of Balvaja grass (''Eleusina indica'').

The earliest reference to both occurs in the late fifteenth book of the Atharvaveda.<ref name=fx1_ve1_312/> [[इतिहास|Itihāsa]] then appears in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx2_ve1_312/> the Jaiminīya,<ref name=fx3_ve1_312/> Bṛhadāraṇyaka,<ref name=fx4_ve1_312/> and Chāndogya Upaniṣads.<ref name=fx5_ve1_312/> In the latter it is expressly declared with [[पुराण|Purāṇa]] to make up the fifth Veda, while the [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx6_ve1_312/> makes the [[इतिहास|Itihāsa]] a Veda and the [[पुराण|Purāṇa]] a Veda. The [[इतिहास|Itihāsa]]-veda and the [[पुराण|Purāṇa]]-veda appear also in the Gopatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx7_ve1_312/> while the Śatapatha<ref name=fx8_ve1_312/> identifies the [[इतिहास|Itihāsa]] as well as the [[पुराण|Purāṇa]] with the Veda. In one passage '''[[अन्वाख्यान|Anvākhyāna]]''' and [[इतिहास|Itihāsa]] are distinguished<ref name=fx9_ve1_312/> as different classes of works, but the exact point of distinction is obscure; probably the former was supplementary. The [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Āraṇyaka<ref name=fx10_ve1_312/> mentions Itihāsas and Purāṇas in the plural.<br><br>There is nothing to show in the older literature what distinction there was, if any, between [[इतिहास|Itihāsa]] and [[पुराण|Purāṇa]]; and the late literature,<ref name=fx11_ve1_312/> which has been elaborately examined by Sieg,<ref name=fx12_ve1_312/> yields no consistent result. Geldner<ref name=fx13_ve1_312/> has conjectured that there existed a single work, the [[इतिहास|Itihāsa]]-[[पुराण|purāṇa]], a collection  of the old legends of all sorts, heroic, cosmogonic, genealogical; but though a work called [[इतिहास|Itihāsa]], and another called [[पुराण|Purāṇa]], were probably known to Patañjali,<ref name=fx14_ve1_312/> the inaccuracy of Geldner's view is proved by the fact that [[यास्क|Yāska]] shows no sign of having known any such work. To him the [[इतिहास|Itihāsa]] may be a part of the [[मन्त्र|Mantra]] literature itself,<ref name=fx15_ve1_312/> Aitihāsikas being merely people who interpret the Rigveda by seeing in it legends where others see myths.<ref name=fx16_ve1_312/> The fact, however, that the use of the compound form is rare, and that [[यास्क|Yāska]] regularly has [[इतिहास|Itihāsa]],<ref name=fx17_ve1_312/> not [[इतिहास|Itihāsa]]-[[पुराण|purāṇa]], is against the theory of there ever having been one work.<br><br>The relation of [[इतिहास|Itihāsa]] to '''[[आख्यान|Ākhyāna]]''' is also uncertain. Sieg<ref name=fx18_ve1_312/> considers that the words [[इतिहास|Itihāsa]] and [[पुराण|Purāṇa]] referred to the great body of mythology, legendary history, and cosmogonic legend available to the Vedic poets, and roughly classed as a fifth Veda, though not definitely and finally fixed. Thus, Anvākhyānas, '''Anuvyākhyānas,''' and '''Vyākhyānas''' could arise, and separate Ākhyānas could still exist outside the cycle, while an [[आख्यान|Ākhyāna]] could also be a part of the [[इतिहास|Itihāsa]]-[[पुराण|purāṇa]]. He also suggests that the word [[आख्यान|Ākhyāna]] has special reference to the form of the narrative. Oldenberg,<ref name=fx19_ve1_312/> following Windisch,<ref name=fx20_ve1_312/> and followed by Geldner,<ref name=fx21_ve1_312/> Sieg, and others, has found in the [[आख्यान|Ākhyāna]] form a mixture of prose and verse, alternating as the narrative was concerned with the mere accessory parts of the tale, or with the chief points, at which the poetic form was naturally produced to correspond with the stress of the emotion. This theory has been severely criticized by Hertel<ref name=fx22_ve1_312/> and von Schroeder.<ref name=fx23_ve1_312/> These scholars, in accordance with older suggestions of Max Müller<ref name=fx24_ve1_312/> and Lévi,<ref name=fx25_ve1_312/> see in the  so-called [[आख्यान|Ākhyāna]] hymns of the Rigveda, in which Oldenberg finds actual specimens of the supposed literary genus, though the prose has been lost, actual remains of ritual dramas. Elsewhere<ref name=fx26_ve1_312/> it has been suggested that the hymns in question are merely literary dialogues.<br>

इभ|१। इभ|ibha|ఇభ|ಇಭ|_vei1@319|_vei1_pn79
<u>'''1. Ibha'''</u> is a word of somewhat doubtful sense and interpretation. It is found only in the Saṃhitās,<ref name=fx1_ve1_319/> and especially in the Rigveda.<ref name=fx2_ve1_319/> According to Roth<ref name=fx3_ve1_319/> and Ludwig<ref name=fx4_ve1_319/> the sense is ‘retainer,’ and Zimmer<ref name=fx5_ve1_319/> thinks that it includes not only dependants and servants, but also the royal family and the youthful cadets of the chief families. In the opinion of Pischel and Geldner<ref name=fx6_ve1_319/> it denotes ‘elephant.’ This view is supported by the authority of the commentators Sāyaṇa<ref name=fx7_ve1_319/> and Mahīdhara;<ref name=fx8_ve1_319/> the [[निरुक्त|Nirukta]],<ref name=fx9_ve1_319/> too, gives ‘elephant’ as one of the senses of the word. Megasthenes<ref name=fx10_ve1_319/> and Nearchos<ref name=fx11_ve1_319/> tell us that elephants were a royal prerogative, and the derivative word '''[[इभ्य|Ibhya]]''' may thus be naturally explained as denoting merely ‘rich’ (lit., ‘possessor of elephants’).<ref name=fx12_ve1_319/><br>

इभ|२। इभ|ibha|ఇభ|ಇಭ|_vei1@320|_vei1_pn79
<u>'''2. Ibha'''</u> in one passage of the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_320/> appears certainly to be intended as an abbreviation of the proper name '''[[स्मद्इभ|Smadibha]].''' <br>

इभ्य|ibhya|ఇభ్య|ಇಭ್ಯ|_vei1@321|_vei1_pn80
<u>'''Ibhya'''</u> occurs once in the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_321/> in the plural, when a king is said to devour his Ibhyas as the fire the forest; and twice in the Chāndogya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]],<ref name=fx2_ve1_321/> in one passage as the first member of a compound, and in the other as either a proper name or an adjective. Roth,<ref name=fx3_ve1_321/> Ludwig,<ref name=fx4_ve1_321/> and Zimmer<ref name=fx5_ve1_321/> interpret the word as ‘retainers’ in the Rigveda, but in the Chāndogya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]] Roth thinks it means ‘rich.’ Pischel and Geldner<ref name=fx6_ve1_321/> accept the sense in all passages. Bo7htlingk in his translation of the Chāndogya treats the word as simply a proper name, ‘Ibhya's village’ (''[[इभ्य|ibhya]]-[[ग्राम|grāma]]'') and ‘Ibhya.’<br>

इरिण|iriṇa|iriNa|ఇరిణ|ಇರಿಣ|_vei1@322|_vei1_pn80
<u>'''Iriṇa'''</u> (neut.) occurs not rarely in the later Saṃhitās<ref name=fx1_ve1_322/> and Brāhmaṇas<ref name=fx2_ve1_322/> in the sense of ‘a cleft in the ground,’ usually natural (''sva-[[कृत|kṛta]]''). The same meaning is also, as Pischel<ref name=fx3_ve1_322/> shows, to be ascribed to it in three passages of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx4_ve1_322/> in one<ref name=fx5_ve1_322/> of which the hole is referred to as ‘made by water’ (''apā kṛtam''). In another passage of the Rigveda<ref name=fx6_ve1_322/> the word refers to the place on which the dice are thrown. Hence Pischel<ref name=fx7_ve1_322/> concludes that the dicing-board must have been so called because it contained holes into which the dice had to be thrown if possible. Lüders,<ref name=fx8_ve1_322/> however, points out that this assumption is not necessary; the dice ('''[[अक्ष|Akṣa]]''') were merely thrown on a space dug out, which could be called '''[[इरिण|Iriṇa]],''' as being a hole in the ground, though not a natural one. This view is supported by the commentary of Sāyaṇa,<ref name=fx9_ve1_322/> as well as by [[दुर्ग|Durga]] in his note on the [[निरुक्त|Nirukta]].<ref name=fx10_ve1_322/> <br>

<u>'''Iṣa Śyāvāśvi'''</u> is mentioned in a [[वंश|Vaṃśa]] (‘list of teachers’) of the Jaiminīya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] (iv. 16, 1) as a pupil of [[अगस्त्य|Agastya]].<br>

इषीका|iṣīkā|iShiikaa|ఇషీకా|ಇಷೀಕಾ|iSheekaa|_vei1@324|_vei1_pn81
<u>'''Iṣīkā,'''</u> ‘a stalk of reed grass,’ occurs frequently from the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_324/> onwards, often as an emblem of fragility. In the [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Āraṇyaka<ref name=fx2_ve1_324/> it seems to denote the pin fixed in the bar of a pen to keep cattle in (''argaleṣīke,'' ‘bolt and pin’). A basket (''[[शूर्प|śūrpa]]'') of [[इषीका|Iṣīkā]] is referred to in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx3_ve1_324/><br>

इषु|iṣu|iShu|ఇషు|ಇಷು|_vei1@325|_vei1_pn81
<u>'''Iṣu'''</u> is the usual name for ‘arrow’ from the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_325/> onwards. Other names are '''[[शर्य|Śarya]], Śārī,''' and '''[[बाण|Bāṇa]].''' In the hymn of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx2_ve1_325/> which gives a catalogue of armour, two kinds of arrows are distinctly referred to: the one is poisoned (''ālāktā''), and has a head of horn (''ruru-śīrṣṇī''); the other is copper-, bronze-, or iron-headed (''ayo-mukham''). Poisoned (''digdhā'') arrows are also referred to in the Atharvaveda.<ref name=fx3_ve1_325/> The arrows were feathered.<ref name=fx4_ve1_325/> The parts of an arrow are enumerated in the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx5_ve1_325/> as the shaft (''[[शल्य|śalya]]''), the feather-socket (''[[पर्ण-धि|parṇa-dhi]]''), the point (''[[शृङ्ग|śṛṅga]]''), the neck of the point in which the shaft is fixed (''[[कुल्मल|kulmala]]''), and the '''[[अपस्कम्भ|Apaskambha]]''' and '''[[अपाष्ठ|Apāṣṭha]],''' which are of more doubtful significance. In the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx6_ve1_325/> the parts of an arrow are given as the point (''anīka''), the ''[[शल्य|śalya]], [[तेजन|tejana]],'' and the feathers (''parṇāni''), where ''[[शल्य|śalya]]'' and ''[[तेजन|tejana]]'' must apparently mean the upper and lower parts of the shaft, since it is reasonable to suppose that the arrow is described as a whole consecutively. So in the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx7_ve1_325/> the arrow of Kāma is described as having feathers, a shaft  (''[[शल्य|śalya]]''), and a firm fastening (''[[कुल्मल|kulmala]]'').<ref name=fx8_ve1_325/> The arrow was shot from the ear, and so is described in the Rigveda<ref name=fx9_ve1_325/> as ‘having the ear for its place of birth.’<br><br>As a measure of length, the [[इषु|Iṣu]] was five spans, say three feet.<ref name=fx10_ve1_325/> A regular profession of arrow-making existed (''[[इषु|iṣu]]-kṛt,''<ref name=fx11_ve1_325/> ''[[इषु|iṣu]]-kāra'').<ref name=fx12_ve1_325/><br>

<u>'''Iṣu-dhi'''</u> (‘arrow-holder’) is the name of the quiver which was carried by every bowman. The word is common from the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_327/> onwards.

In another passage,<ref name=fx2_ve1_338/> however, the country of the Uttara Kurus is stated by '''[[वासिष्ठ|Vāsiṣṭha]] [[सात्यहव्य|Sātyahavya]]''' to be a land of the gods (''deva-[[क्षेत्र|kṣetra]]''), but '''[[जानंतपि|Jānaṃtapi]] Atyarāti''' was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not wholly mythical. It is reasonable to accept Zimmer's view that the northern Kurus were settled in Kaśmīr, especially as '''[[कुरुक्षेत्र|Kurukṣetra]]''' is the region where tribes advancing from Kaśmīr might naturally be found.

He overcame in argument [[प्राचीनयोग्य|Prācīnayogya]] [[शौचेय|Śauceya]],<ref name=fx9_ve1_351/> and apparently also [[भद्रसेन आजातशत्रव|Bhadrasena Ājātaśatrava]],<ref name=fx10_ve1_351/> though the text here seems to read the name as Āraṇi. He was a [[गौतम|Gautama]],<ref name=fx11_ve1_351/> and is often alluded to as such. As an authority on questions of ritual and philosophy, he is repeatedly referred to by his patronymic name [[आरुणि|Āruṇi]] in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx12_ve1_351/> the Bṛhadāraṇyaka [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]],<ref name=fx13_ve1_351/> the Chāndogya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]],<ref name=fx14_ve1_351/> and occasionally in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]],<ref name=fx15_ve1_351/> the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]],<ref name=fx16_ve1_351/> and the Ṣaḍviṃśa<ref name=fx17_ve1_351/> Brāhmaṇas, as well as the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]].<ref name=fx18_ve1_351/> In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā he is not mentioned, according to Geldner,<ref name=fx19_ve1_351/> but only his father Aruṇa; his name does not occur, according to Weber,<ref name=fx20_ve1_351/> in the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]], but in the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx21_ve1_351/> he is, as [[आरुणि|Āruṇi]], known as a contemporary of '''[[दिवोदास भैमसेनि|Divodāsa Bhaimaseni]],''' and in the Jaiminīya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx22_ve1_351/> he is mentioned as serving '''[[वासिष्ठ|Vāsiṣṭha]] [[चैकितानेय|Caikitāneya]].''' In the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] tradition he seldom appears. There is an allusion in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx23_ve1_351/> to Kusurubinda [[औद्दालकि|Auddālaki]], and according to the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx24_ve1_351/> [[नचिकेतस्|Naciketas]] was a son of [[वाजश्रवस|Vājaśravasa]] [[गौतम|Gautama]], who  is made out to be Uddālaka by Sāyaṇa.<ref name=fx25_ve1_351/> But the episode of [[नचिकेतस्|Naciketas]], being somewhat unreal, cannot be regarded as of historical value in proving relationship. Aruṇa is known to the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā. A real son of Uddālaka was the famous '''[[श्वेतकेतु|Śvetaketu]],''' who is expressly reported by Āpastamba<ref name=fx26_ve1_351/> to have been in his time an Avara or later authority, a statement of importance for the date of [[आरुणि|Āruṇi]].<br>

<u>'''Upa-niṣad'''</u> in the Brāhmaṇas<ref name=fx1_ve1_363/> normally denotes the ‘secret sense’ of some word or text, sometimes the ‘secret rule’ of the mendicant. But in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]]<ref name=fx2_ve1_363/> it is already used in the plural as the designation of a class of writings, no doubt actually existing and similar to the Upaniṣads in the nature of their subject-matter and its treatment. Similarly the sections of the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]] end with the words ''ity [[उपनिषद्|upaniṣad]].''

The natural derivation, adopted by Max Müller<ref name=fx5_ve1_363/> and usual ever since, makes the word mean firstly a session of pupils, hence secret doctrine, and secondly the title of a work on secret doctrine. Oldenberg,<ref name=fx6_ve1_363/> however, traces the use of the word to the earlier  sense of ‘worship’ (''cf. upāsana''). Deussen<ref name=fx7_ve1_363/> considers the original sense to have been ‘secret word,’ next ‘secret text,’ and then ‘secret import,’ but this order of meaning is improbable. Hopkins<ref name=fx8_ve1_363/> suggests that [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]] denotes a subsidiary treatise, but this sense does not account naturally for the common use as ‘secret meaning,’ which is far more frequent than any other.<br>

Geldner,<ref name=fx5_ve1_368/> on the other hand, thinks that the poet, who was '''[[कवष|Kavaṣa]] [[ऐलूष|Ailūṣa]],''' was ill-treated by his patron's son, [[उपमश्रवस्|Upamaśravas]], and cast into a ditch or well, where he uttered his complaint and appeal for mercy. But of this there is no adequate evidence, and the tradition of the Bṛhaddevatā seems sound.<br>

The passages in the Rigveda leave little doubt that the word means an upright pillar. As it is, in the Atharvaveda, coupled with '''[[परिमित्|Parimit]]''' and '''[[प्रतिमित्|Pratimit]],''' the conclusion is natural that the latter word denotes the beams supporting the [[उपमित्|Upamit]], presumably by leaning against it at an angle, while '''[[परिमित्|Parimit]]''' denotes the beams connecting the Upamits horizontally.

[[यास्क|Yāska]]<ref name=fx2_ve1_371/> renders the word by ‘maker of groats’ (''[[सक्तु|saktu]]-kārikā''), and Roth,<ref name=fx3_ve1_371/> Grassmann,<ref name=fx4_ve1_371/> Zimmer,<ref name=fx5_ve1_371/> as well as others, connect it with the operation of grinding corn. Pischel,<ref name=fx6_ve1_371/> however, who points out that corn was not ground between two stones, but beaten on a stone with a pestle (''[[दृषद्|dṛṣad]]''), considers that [[उपल-प्रक्षिणी|Upala-prakṣiṇī]] denotes a woman that assisted at the crushing of Soma (''cf.'' '''[[उपर|Upara]]'''). Von Schroeder,<ref name=fx7_ve1_371/> who more correctly points out that there is no objection to regarding ''upala'' as the mortar in which the corn was placed and then beaten with the pestle, renders the word literally as ‘one who fills the (lower) stone (with corn).’<br>

In the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx3_ve1_376/> it seems to have the same meaning. Whitney,<ref name=fx4_ve1_376/> however, renders it ‘couch,’ though he translates<ref name=fx5_ve1_376/> the parallel word '''[[आस्तरण|Āstaraṇa]]''' in another passage<ref name=fx6_ve1_376/> by ‘cushion.’ <br>

<u>'''Upa-sti'''</u> denotes both in the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_377/> and the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx2_ve1_377/> a ‘dependent,’ just as later in the Epic<ref name=fx3_ve1_377/> the subordination of the [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] to the two superior castes is expressed by the verb ''upa-sthā,'' ‘stand under,’ ‘support.’ The word also appears, with the same sense, in the form of Sti, but only in the Rigveda.<ref name=fx4_ve1_377/> The exact nature of the dependence connoted by the term is quite uncertain. Zimmer<ref name=fx5_ve1_377/> conjectures that the ‘dependents’ were the members of defeated Aryan tribes who became clients of the king, as among the Greeks, Romans, and Germans, the term possibly including persons who had lost their freedom through dicing.<ref name=fx6_ve1_377/> The evidence of the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx7_ve1_377/> shows that among the Upastis were included the chariot-makers (''[[रथ-कार|ratha-kāra]]''), the smiths (''[[तक्षन्|takṣan]]''), and the charioteers (''[[सूत|sūta]]''), and troop-leaders (''[[ग्राम|grāma]]-ṇī''), while the Rigveda passages negative the possibility of the ‘subjects’ (''sti'') being the whole people. It is therefore fair to assume that they were the clients proper of the king, not servile, but attached in a special relation to him as opposed to the ordinary population. They may well have included among them not only the classes suggested by Zimmer, but also higher elements, such as refugees from other clans, as well as ambitious men who sought advancement in the royal service. Indeed, the [[सूत|Sūta]] and the Grāmaṇī were, as such, officers of the king's household--kingmakers, not themselves kings, as they are described in the Atharvaveda.<ref name=fx8_ve1_377/> The use of the word in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx9_ve1_377/> the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx10_ve1_377/> and the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]],<ref name=fx11_ve1_377/> is purely metaphorical, as well as in the one passage of the Rigveda in which it occurs. In the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx12_ve1_377/> [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]], [[शूद्र|Śūdra]], and [[आर्य|Ārya]] are referred to as Upastis, perhaps in the general sense of ‘subject.’ <br>

<u>'''Ubhayā-dant,'''</u> ‘having incisors in both jaws,’ is an expression employed to distinguish, among domestic animals, the horse,  the ass, etc., from the goat, the sheep, and cattle. The distinction occurs in a late hymn of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx1_ve1_384/> and is several times alluded to in the later Saṃhitās<ref name=fx2_ve1_384/> and the Brāhmaṇas.<ref name=fx3_ve1_384/> In one passage of the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx4_ve1_384/> man is classed with the horse as ''[[उभया-दन्त्|ubhayā-dant]].'' The opposite is ''anyato-dant,'' ‘having incisors in one jaw only,’ a term regularly applied to cattle,<ref name=fx5_ve1_384/> the eight incisors of which are, in fact, limited to the lower jaw. The ass is styled ''[[उभया-दन्त्|ubhayā-dant]]'' in the Atharvaveda.<ref name=fx6_ve1_384/> In one passage of the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx7_ve1_384/> however, the epithet is applied to a ram; but the sense here is that a marvel occurs, just as in the Rigveda<ref name=fx8_ve1_384/> a ram destroys a lioness. Bloomfield<ref name=fx9_ve1_384/> suggests in the Atharvaveda passage another reading which would mean ‘horse.’ A parallel division of animals is that of the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]]<ref name=fx10_ve1_384/> and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās<ref name=fx11_ve1_384/> into ‘whole-hoofed’ (''eka-[[शफ|śapha]]'') and ‘small’ (''kṣudra'').<br><br>Zimmer<ref name=fx12_ve1_384/> seeks to show from the Greek <ref name=fx13_ve1_384/> and the Latin ''ambidens''<ref name=fx14_ve1_384/> that the Indo-European was familiar with the division of the five sacrificial animals into the two classes of man and horse on the one hand, and cattle, sheep, and goats on the other.

<u>'''Urvarā'''</u> is with '''[[क्षेत्र|Kṣetra]]''' the regular expression, from the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_389/> onwards, denoting a piece of ‘ploughland’ (). Fertile (''apnasvatī'') fields<ref name=fx2_ve1_389/> are spoken of as well as waste fields (''ārtanā'').<ref name=fx3_ve1_389/> Intensive cultivation by means of irrigation is clearly referred to both in the Rigveda<ref name=fx4_ve1_389/> and in the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx5_ve1_389/> while allusion is also made to the use of manure.<ref name=fx6_ve1_389/> The fields (''[[क्षेत्र|kṣetra]]'') were carefully measured according to the Rigveda.<ref name=fx7_ve1_389/> This fact points clearly to individual ownership in land for the plough, a conclusion supported by the reference of Apālā, in a hymn of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx8_ve1_389/> to her father's field (''[[उर्वरा|urvarā]]''), which is put on the same level as his head of hair as a personal possession. Consistent with this are the epithets ‘winning fields’ (''[[उर्वरा|urvarā]]-sā, [[उर्वरा|urvarā]]-jit, [[क्षेत्र|kṣetra]]-sā''),<ref name=fx9_ve1_389/> while ‘lord of fields’ used of a god<ref name=fx10_ve1_389/> is presumably a transfer of a human epithet (''[[उर्वरा|urvarā]]-pati''). Moreover, fields are spoken of in the same  connexion as children,<ref name=fx11_ve1_389/> and the conquest of fields (''kṣetrāṇi saṃ-ji'') is often referred to in the Saṃhitās.<ref name=fx12_ve1_389/> Very probably, as suggested by Pischel,<ref name=fx13_ve1_389/> the ploughland was bounded by grass land (perhaps denoted by '''[[खिल|Khila]], Khilya''') which in all likelihood would be joint property on the analogy of property elsewhere. There is no trace in Vedic literature of communal property in the sense of ownership by a community of any sort,<ref name=fx14_ve1_389/> nor is there mention of communal cultivation. Individual property in land seems also presumed later on. In the Chāndogya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]]<ref name=fx15_ve1_389/> the things given as examples of wealth include fields and houses (''āyatanāni''). The Greek evidence<ref name=fx16_ve1_389/> also points to individual ownership. The precise nature of the ownership is of course not determined by the expression ‘individual ownership.’ The legal relationship of the head of a family and its members is nowhere explained, and can only be conjectured (see '''[[पितृ|Pitṛ]]'''). Very often a family may have lived together with undivided shares in the land.

Zimmer<ref name=fx5_ve1_402/> thinks that the Uśīnaras earlier lived farther to the north-west, but for this there is no clear evidence. His theory is based merely on the fact that the Anukramaṇī (Index) of the Rigveda ascribes one hymn<ref name=fx6_ve1_402/> to [[शिबि|Śibi]] Auśīnara, and that the Śibis were known to Alexander's followers as ,<ref name=fx7_ve1_402/> living between the Indus and the Akesines (Chenab).

A more usual<ref name=fx4_ve1_428/> division (not found in the Rigveda) is into five seasons,  ''[[वसन्त|vasanta]], [[ग्रीष्म|grīṣma]], varṣā, [[शरद्|śarad]], hemama-siśira,'' but occasionally the five are otherwise divided, ''varṣā-[[शरद्|śarad]]'' being made one season.<ref name=fx5_ve1_428/> Sometimes six<ref name=fx6_ve1_428/> seasons are reckoned, ''[[हेमन्त|hemanta]]'' and ''[[शिशिर|śiśira]]'' being divided, so that the six seasons can be made parallel to the twelve months of the year. A still more artificial arrangement<ref name=fx7_ve1_428/> makes the seasons seven, possibly by reckoning the intercalary month as a season, as Weber and Zimmer<ref name=fx8_ve1_428/> hold, or more probably because of the predilection for the number seven, as Roth<ref name=fx9_ve1_428/> suggests. Occasionally the word ''[[ऋतु|ṛtu]]'' is applied to the months.<ref name=fx10_ve1_428/> The last season, according to the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx11_ve1_428/> is ''[[हेमन्त|hemanta]].''<br><br>The growth of the division of the seasons from three to five is rightly explained by Zimmer<ref name=fx12_ve1_428/> as indicating the advance of the Vedic Indians towards the east. It is not Rigvedic, but dominates the later Saṃhitās. Traces of an earlier division of the year into winter and summer do not appear clearly in the Rigveda, where the appropriate words ''[[हिमा|himā]]'' and ''[[समा|samā]]'' are merely general appellations of the year, and where ''[[शरद्|śarad]]''<ref name=fx13_ve1_428/> is commoner than either as a designation of the year, because it denotes the harvest, a time of overwhelming importance to a young agricultural people. The division of the year in one passage of the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx14_ve1_428/> into two periods of six months is merely formal, and in no way an indication of old tradition. <br>

<u>'''Ṛtv-ij'''</u> is the regular term for ‘sacrificial priest,’ covering all the different kinds of priests employed at the sacrifice. It appears certain that all the priests were Brāhmaṇas.<ref name=fx1_ve1_430/> The number of priests officiating at a sacrifice with different functions was almost certainly seven. The oldest list, occurring in one passage of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx2_ve1_430/> enumerates their names as [[होतृ|Hotṛ]], [[पोतृ|Potṛ]], [[नेष्टृ|Neṣṭṛ]], Agnīdh, [[प्रशास्तृ|Praśāstṛ]], [[अध्वर्यु|Adhvaryu]], [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]], besides the institutor of the sacrifice. The number of seven probably explains the phrase ‘seven Hotṛs’ occurring so frequently in the Rigveda, and is most likely connected with that of the mythical ‘seven [[ऋषिस्|Ṛṣis]].’ It may be compared with the eight of Iran.<ref name=fx3_ve1_430/> The chief of the seven priests was the [[होतृ|Hotṛ]], who was the singer of the hymns, and in the early times their composer also. The [[अध्वर्यु|Adhvaryu]] performed the practical work of the sacrifice, and accompanied his performance with muttered formulas of prayer and deprecation of evil. His chief assistance was derived from the Agnīdh, the two performing the smaller sacrifices without other help in practical matters. The [[प्रशास्तृ|Praśāstṛ]], Upavaktṛ, or Maitrāvaruṇa, as he was variously called, appeared only in the greater sacrifices as giving instructions to the [[होतृ|Hotṛ]], and as entrusted with certain litanies. The [[पोतृ|Potṛ]], [[नेष्टृ|Neṣṭṛ]], and [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] belonged to the ritual of the Soma sacrifice, the latter being later styled [[ब्राह्मणाच्छंसिन्|Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin]] to distinguish him from the priest who in the later  ritual acted as supervisor. Other priests referred to in the Rigveda<ref name=fx4_ve1_430/> are the singers of Sāmans or chants, the Udgātṛ and his assistant the [[प्रस्तोतृ|Prastotṛ]], while the [[प्रतिहर्तृ|Pratihartṛ]], another assistant, though not mentioned, may quite well have been known. Their functions undoubtedly represent a later stage of the ritual, the development of the elaborate series of sacrificial calls on the one hand, and on the other the use of long hymns addressed to the Soma plant. Other priests, such as the Achāvāka,<ref name=fx5_ve1_430/> the Grāvastut, the Unnetṛ, and the [[सुब्रह्मण्य|Subrahmaṇya]], were known later in the developed ritual of the Brāhmaṇas, making in all sixteen priests, who were technically and artificially classed in four groups<ref name=fx6_ve1_430/> [[होतृ|Hotṛ]], Maitrāvaruṇa, Achāvāka, and Grāvastut; Udgātṛ, [[प्रस्तोतृ|Prastotṛ]], [[प्रतिहर्तृ|Pratihartṛ]], and [[सुब्रह्मण्य|Subrahmaṇya]]; [[अध्वर्यु|Adhvaryu]], Pratisthātṛ, [[नेष्टृ|Neṣṭṛ]], and Unnetṛ; [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]], [[ब्राह्मणाच्छंसिन्|Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin]], Agnīdhra, and Petṛ.<br><br>Apart from all these priests was the '''[[पुरोहित|Purohita]],''' who was the spiritual adviser of the king in all his religious duties. Geldner<ref name=fx7_ve1_430/> holds that, as a rule, when the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] actually took part in one of the great sacrifices he played the part of the [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]], in the sense of the priest who superintended the whole conduct of the ritual. He sees evidence for this view in a considerable number of passages of the Rigveda<ref name=fx8_ve1_430/> and the later literature,<ref name=fx9_ve1_430/> where [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] and [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] were combined or identified. Oldenberg,<ref name=fx10_ve1_430/> however, more correctly points out  that in the earlier period this was not the case: the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] was then normally the [[होतृ|Hotṛ]], the singer of the most important of the songs; it was only later that the [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]], who in the capacity of overseer of the rite is not known to the Rigveda, acquired the function of general supervision hitherto exercised by the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]], who was ''ex officio'' skilled in the use of magic and in guarding the king by spells which could also be applied to guarding the sacrifice from evil demons. With this agrees the fact that Agni, pre-eminently<ref name=fx11_ve1_430/> the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] of men, is also a [[होतृ|Hotṛ]], and that the two divine Hotṛs of the Āprī hymns are called<ref name=fx12_ve1_430/> the divine Purohitas. On the other hand, the rule is explicitly recognized in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx13_ve1_430/> that a [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] should have a [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] as a [[पुरोहित|Purohita]]; and in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx14_ve1_430/> the [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] family have a special claim to the office of [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]]-[[पुरोहित|Purohita]], perhaps an indication that it was they who first as Purohitas exchanged the function of Hotṛs for that of Brahmans in the sacrificial ritual.<br><br>The sacrifices were performed for an individual in the great majority of cases. The Sattra,<ref name=fx15_ve1_430/> or prolonged sacrificial session, was, however, performed for the common benefit of the priests taking part in it, though its advantageous results could only be secured if all the members actually engaged were consecrated (''dīkṣita''). Sacrifices for a people as such were unknown. The sacrifice for the king was, it is true, intended to bring about the prosperity of his people also; but it is characteristic that the prayer<ref name=fx16_ve1_430/> for welfare includes by name only the priest and the king, referring to the people indirectly in connexion with the prosperity of their cattle and agriculture. <br>

<u>'''Ṛṣi,'''</u> ‘seer,’ is primarily a composer of hymns to the gods. In the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_435/> reference is often made to previous singers and to contemporary poets.

The [[ऋषि|Ṛṣi]] was the most exalted of Brāhmaṇas,<ref name=fx6_ve1_435/> and his skill, which is often compared with that of a carpenter,<ref name=fx7_ve1_435/> was regarded as heaven-sent.<ref name=fx8_ve1_435/> The [[पुरोहित|Purohita]], whether as [[होतृ|Hotṛ]] or as [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] (see '''[[ऋत्व्इज्|Ṛtvij]]'''), was a singer.<ref name=fx9_ve1_435/> No doubt the [[ऋषिस्|Ṛṣis]] were normally<ref name=fx10_ve1_435/> attached to the houses of the great, the petty kings of Vedic times, or the nobles of the royal household.

The Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx2_ve1_602/> tells of '''[[धृतराष्ट्र|Dhṛtarāṣṭra]],''' king of [[काशि|Kāśi]], who was defeated by '''[[शतानीक सात्राजित|Śatānīka Sātrājita]],''' with the result that the Kāśis, down to the time of the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], gave up the kindling of the sacred fire. [[सात्राजित|Sātrājita]] was a '''[[भरत|Bharata]].''' We hear also of '''[[अजातशत्रु|Ajātaśatru]]''' as a king of [[काशि|Kāśi]];<ref name=fx3_ve1_602/> and no doubt '''Bhadrasena Ajātaśatrava,''' a contemporary of '''Uddālaka,''' was also a king of [[काशि|Kāśi]].<br><br>The Kāśis and '''Videhas''' were closely connected, as was natural in view of their geographical position. The compound name [[काशि|Kāśi]]-[[विदेह|Videha]] occurs in the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]];<ref name=fx4_ve1_602/> in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]]<ref name=fx5_ve1_602/> '''Gārgī''' describes [[अजातशत्रु|Ajātaśatru]] as either a [[काशि|Kāśi]] or a [[विदेह|Videha]] king.

It is a fair conclusion that between these two great groups of peoples there did exist some political conflict as well as probably a difference of culture in some degree. The Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx11_ve1_602/> in the story of the advance of Āryan civilization over [[कोसल|Kosala]] and [[विदेह|Videha]], preserves a clear tradition of this time, and a piece of evidence that in the Kuru-[[पञ्चाल|Pañcāla]] country lay the real centre of the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] culture (see also '''Kuru-[[पञ्चाल|Pañcāla]]'''). That the [[कोसल|Kosala]]-Videhas were originally settlers of older date than the Kuru-Pañcālas is reasonably obvious from their geographical position, but the true [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] culture appears to have been brought to them from the Kuru-Pañcala country. It is very probable that the East was less Āryan than the West, and that it was less completely reduced under Brahmin spiritual supremacy, as the movement of Buddhism was Eastern, and the Buddhist texts<ref name=fx12_ve1_602/> reveal a position in which the Kṣatriyas rank above Brāhmaṇas. With this agrees the fact that the later Vedic texts<ref name=fx13_ve1_602/> display  towards the people of [[मगध|Magadha]] a marked antipathy, which may be reasonably explained by that people's lack of orthodoxy, and which may perhaps be traced as far back as the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.<ref name=fx14_ve1_602/> It is, of course, possible that the [[कोसल|Kosala]]-Videhas and Kāśis actually were merely offshoots of the tribes later known as the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that they by reason of distance and less complete subjugation of the aborigines lost their Brahminical culture. This hypothesis, however, appears less likely, though it might be supported by a literal interpretation of the legend of the Aryan migration in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx15_ve1_602/><br>

None of these can be safely<ref name=fx6_ve1_611/> explained, though the last has usually<ref name=fx7_ve1_611/> been taken as a satirical name derived from the gambler's devotion to the dicing place ('''[[सभा|Sabhā]]'''), ‘pillar of the dicing hall.’ The first literally means ‘seeing ill-luck,’<ref name=fx8_ve1_611/> and may refer to the quickness of the dicer to note an error on the part of his antagonist, or to his eagerness to see the defeat of his rival.<br>

कुरु|kuru|కురు|ಕುರು|_vei1@645|_vei1_pn165

There is clear evidence that it was in the country of the Kurus, or the allied KuruPañcālas, that the great Brāhmaṇas were composed.<ref name=fx1_ve1_645/> The Kurus are comparatively seldom mentioned alone, their name being usually coupled with that of the Pañcālas on account of the intimate connexion of the two peoples.

In support of this view, Weber refers to the story in the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx10_ve1_645/> of a dispute between '''[[वक दाल्भ्य|Vaka Dālbhya]]''' and '''[[धृतराष्ट्र वैचित्रवीर्य|Dhṛtarāṣṭra Vaicitravīrya]],''' the former being held to be by origin a [[पञ्चाल|Pañcāla]], while the latter is held  to be a Kuru. But there is no trace of a quarrel between Kurus and Pañcālas in the passage in question, which merely preserves the record of a dispute on a ritual matter between a priest and a prince: the same passage refers to the Naimiṣīya sacrifice among the Kuru-Pañcālas, and emphasizes the close connexion of the two peoples.<ref name=fx11_ve1_645/> Secondly, Weber conjectures in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.<ref name=fx12_ve1_645/> that '''[[सुभद्रिका|Subhadrikā]]''' of '''Kāmpila''' was the chief queen of the king of a tribe living in the neighbourhood of the clan, for whose king the horse sacrifice described in the Saṃhitā was performed. But the interpretation of this passage by Weber is open to grave doubt;<ref name=fx13_ve1_645/> and in the [[काण्व|Kāṇva]] recension of the Saṃhitā<ref name=fx14_ve1_645/> a passage used at the [[राजसूय|Rājasūya]] shows that the Kuru-Pañcālas had actually one king. Moreover, there is the evidence of the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx15_ve1_645/> that the old name of the Pañcālas was '''[[क्रिवि|Krivi]].''' This word looks very like a variant of Kuru, and Zimmer<ref name=fx16_ve1_645/> plausibly conjectures that the Kurus and Krivis formed the '''[[वैकर्ण|Vaikarṇa]]'''<ref name=fx17_ve1_645/> of the Rigveda, especially as both peoples are found about the [[सिन्धु|Sindhu]] and the [[असिक्नी|Asiknī]].<ref name=fx18_ve1_645/><br><br>The Kurus alone are chiefly mentioned in connexion with the locality which they occupied, '''[[कुरुक्षेत्र|Kurukṣetra]],''' We are told, however, of a domestic priest ('''[[पुरोहित|Purohita]]''') in the service of both the Kurus and the '''Sṛñjayas,'''<ref name=fx19_ve1_645/> who must therefore at one time have been closely connected.<ref name=fx20_ve1_645/> In the Chāndogya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]] reference is made to the Kurus being saved by a mare (''aśvā''),<ref name=fx21_ve1_645/> and to some disaster which befel them owing to a hailstorm.<ref name=fx22_ve1_645/> In the Sūtras, again, a ceremony ([[वाजपेय|Vājapeya]]) of the Kurus is mentioned.<ref name=fx23_ve1_645/> There also a curse, which was pronounced on them and led to their being driven from [[कुरुक्षेत्र|Kurukṣetra]], is alluded to.<ref name=fx24_ve1_645/>  This possibly adumbrates the misfortunes of the Kauravas in the epic tradition.<br><br>In the Rigveda the Kurus do not appear under that name as a people. But mention is made of a prince, '''Kuruśravaṇa''' (‘Glory of the Kurus’),<ref name=fx25_ve1_645/> and of a '''[[पाकस्थामन् कौरयाण|Pākasthāman Kaurayāṇa]].'''<ref name=fx26_ve1_645/> In the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx27_ve1_645/> there occurs as a king of the Kurus '''[[परिक्षित्|Parikṣit]],''' whose son, '''[[जनम्एजय|Janamejaya]],''' is mentioned in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx28_ve1_645/> as one of the great performers of the horse sacrifice.<br><br>It is a probable conjecture of Oldenberg's<ref name=fx29_ve1_645/> that the Kuru people, as known later, included some of the tribes referred to by other names in the Rigveda. Kuruśravaṇa, shown by his name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the Rigveda called [[त्रासदस्यव|Trāsadasyava]], ‘descendant of '''[[त्रसदस्यु|Trasadasyu]],'''’ who is well known as a king of the '''Pūrus.''' Moreover, it is likely that the [[तृत्सु|Tṛtsu]]'''Bharatas,''' who appear in the Rigveda as enemies of the Pūtus, later coalesced with them to form the Kuru people.<ref name=fx30_ve1_645/> Since the Bharatas appear so prominently in the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] texts as a great people of the past, while the later literature ignores them in its list of nations, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that they became merged in some other tribe. Moreover, there is evidence that the Bharatas occupied the territory in which the Kurus were later found. Two of them are spoken of in a hymn of the Rigveda<ref name=fx31_ve1_645/> as having kindled fire on the '''[[दृषद्वती|Dṛṣadvatī]],''' the '''[[आपया|Āpayā]],''' and the '''[[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]]'''--that is to say, in the sacred places of the later [[कुरुक्षेत्र|Kurukṣetra]]. Similarly, the goddess Bhāratī (‘belonging to the Bharatas’) is constantly mentioned in the Āprī (‘propitiatory’) hymns together with [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]].<ref name=fx32_ve1_645/> Again, according to the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], one [[भरत|Bharata]] king was victorious over the Kāśis,<ref name=fx33_ve1_645/> and another made offerings to [[गङ्गा|Gaṅgā]] and [[यमुना|Yamunā]],<ref name=fx34_ve1_645/> while raids of the Bharatas against the '''Satvants''' are mentioned in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx35_ve1_645/> Nor is it  without importance that the Bharatas appear as a variant for the Kuru Pañcālas in a passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx36_ve1_645/> and that in the list of the great performers of the horse sacrifice the names of one Kuru and two [[भरत|Bharata]] princes are given without any mention of the people over which they ruled, while in other cases that information is specifically given.<ref name=fx37_ve1_645/><br><br>The territory of the Kuru-Pañcālas is declared in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] to be the middle country ('''[[मध्यदेश|Madhyadeśa]]''').<ref name=fx38_ve1_645/> A group of the Kuru people still remained further north--the '''Uttara Kurus''' beyond the Himālaya. It appears from a passage of the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] that the speech of the Northerners-that is, presumably, the Northern Kurus--and of the KuruPañcālas was similar, and regarded as specially pure.<ref name=fx39_ve1_645/> There seems little doubt that the Brahminical culture was developed in the country of the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that it spread thence east, south, and west. Traces of this are seen in the [[व्रात्य|Vrātya]] Stomas (sacrifices for the admission of non-Brahminical Āryans) of the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx40_ve1_645/> and in the fact that in the [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Āraṇyaka it is unusual for a Brahmin to dwell in the territory of '''[[मगध|Magadha]].'''<ref name=fx41_ve1_645/> The repeated mention of KuruPañcāla Brahmins is another indication of their missionary activity.<ref name=fx42_ve1_645/><br><br>The geographical position of the Kuru-Pañcālas renders it probable that they were later immigrants into India than the '''[[कोसल|Kosala]]-[[विदेह|Videha]]''' or the '''Kāśis,'''<ref name=fx43_ve1_645/> who must have been pushed  into their more eastward territories by a new wave of Āryan settlers from the west. But there is no evidence in Vedic literature to show in what relation of time the immigration of the latter peoples stood to that of their neighbours on the west. It has, however, been conjectured,<ref name=fx44_ve1_645/> mainly on the ground of later linguistic phenomena, which have no cogency for the Vedic period, that the Kurus were later immigrants, who, coming by a new route, thrust themselves between the original Āryan tribes which were already in occupation of the country from east to west.

The ripe grain was cut with a sickle ('''[[दात्र|Dātra]], Sṛṇi'''), bound into bundles<ref name=fx12_ve1_697/> ('''[[पर्ष|Parṣa]]'''), and beaten out on the floor of the granary ('''[[खल|Khala]]''').<ref name=fx13_ve1_697/> The grain was then separated from the straw and refuse either by a sieve ('''Titau''') or a winnowing fan ('''[[शूर्प|Śūrpa]]''').<ref name=fx14_ve1_697/> The winnower was called '''Dhānyākṛt,'''<ref name=fx15_ve1_697/> and the grain was measured in a vessel called '''Urdara.'''<ref name=fx16_ve1_697/><br><br>The Rigveda leaves us in doubt as to the kind of grain grown, for '''Yava''' is a word of doubtful signification, and '''[[धाना|Dhānā]]''' is also vague.

The haggling of the market was already familiar in the days of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx6_ve1_771/> and a characteristic hymn of the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx7_ve1_771/> is directed to procuring success in trade.

This unit seems not to be known in the Rigveda, where the meaning of the term '''[[मना|Manā]],''' which occurs once, is mysterious, and where necklets ('''[[निष्क|Niṣka]]''') seem to have been one of the more portable forms of wealth, like jewellery in modern India, and may perhaps have served as a means of exchange.<br>

क्षत्रिय|kṣatriya|kShatriya|క్షత్రియ|ಕ್ಷತ್ರಿಯ|xatriya|_vei1@796|_vei1_pn202
<u>'''Kṣatriya.'''</u>--As the origin of caste, the relation of the castes, intermarriage, and cognate matters may most conveniently be discussed under '''[[वर्ण|Varṇa]],''' this article will be confined to determining, as far as possible, the real character of the class called Kṣatriyas, or collectively '''[[क्षत्र|Kṣatra]].'''<br><br>The evidence of the Jātakas<ref name=fx1_ve1_796/> points to the word Khattiya  denoting the members of the old Āryan nobility who had led the tribes to conquest, '''as well''' as those families of the aborigines who had managed to maintain their princely status in spite of the conquest. In the epic<ref name=fx2_ve1_796/> also the term [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] seems to include these persons, but it has probably a wider signification than Khattiya, and would cover all the royal military vassals and feudal chiefs, expressing, in fact, pretty much the same as the ''barones'' of early English history. Neither in the Jātakas<ref name=fx3_ve1_796/> nor in the epic<ref name=fx4_ve1_796/> is the term co-extensive with all warriors; the army contains many besides the Kṣatriyas, who are the leaders or officers, rather than the rank and file.<br><br>In the later Saṃhitās<ref name=fx5_ve1_796/> and the Brāhmaṇas<ref name=fx6_ve1_796/> the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] stands as a definite member of the social body, distinct from the priest, the subject people, and the slaves, '''[[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]],''' and '''[[शूद्र|Śūdra]].''' It is significant that [[राजन्य|Rājanya]] is a variant to [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]], and an earlier one. Hence it is reasonable to suppose that the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] and [[राजन्य|Rājanya]] are both of similar origin, being princely or connected with royalty. Moreover, the early use of [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] in the Rigveda<ref name=fx7_ve1_796/> is exclusively connected with royal authority or divine authority.<br><br>It is impossible to say exactly what persons would be included in the term [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]]. That it covered the royal house and the various branches of the royal family may be regarded as certain. It, no doubt, also included the nobles and their families: this would explain the occasional opposition of [[राजन्य|Rājanya]] and [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]], as in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx8_ve1_796/> where a [[राजन्य|Rājanya]] asks a [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] for a place for sacrifice (''deva-yajana''). Thus, when strictly applied, [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] would have a wider denotation than [[राजन्य|Rājanya]]. As a rule, however, the two expressions are identical, and both are used as evidence in what follows. That [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] ever included the mere fighting  man has not been proved: in the Rigveda<ref name=fx9_ve1_796/> and later<ref name=fx10_ve1_796/> others than Kṣatriyas regularly fought; but possibly if the nobles had retinues as the kings had, [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] would embrace those retainers who had military functions. The term did not apply to all members of the royal entourage; for example, the '''Grāmaṇī''' was usually a [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]].<br><br>The connexion of the Kṣatriyas with the Brahmins was very close. The prosperity of the two is repeatedly asserted<ref name=fx11_ve1_796/> to be indissolubly associated, especially in the relation of king ('''[[राजन्|Rājan]]''') and domestic priest ('''[[पुरोहित|Purohita]]'''). Sometimes there was feud between [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] and Brahmin.<ref name=fx12_ve1_796/> His management of the sacrifice then gave the Brahmin power to ruin the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] by embroiling him with the people<ref name=fx13_ve1_796/> or with other Kṣatriyas.<ref name=fx14_ve1_796/><br><br>Towards the common people, on the other hand, the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] stood in a relation of well-nigh unquestioned superiority.<ref name=fx15_ve1_796/> There are, however, references to occasional feuds between  the people and the nobles,<ref name=fx16_ve1_796/> in which no doubt the inferior numbers of the latter were compensated by their superior arms and prowess. In the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx17_ve1_796/> the [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] is described as tributary to another (''anyasya bali-kṛt''), to be devoured by another (''anyasyādya''), and to be oppressed at will (''yathākāma-jyeya''). Probably these epithets apply most strictly to the relation of the king and his people, but the passage shows that the people were greatly at the mercy of the nobles. No doubt the king granted to them the right, which may have been hereditary, to be supported by the common people, whose feudal superiors they thus became. In return for these privileges the Kṣatriyas had probably duties of protection to perform, as well as some judicial functions, to judge from an obscure passage of the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā.<ref name=fx18_ve1_796/><br><br>The main duty of the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] in the small states<ref name=fx19_ve1_796/> of the Vedic period was readiness for war. The bow is thus his special attribute,<ref name=fx20_ve1_796/> just as the goad is that of the agriculturist; for the bow is the main weapon of the Veda. Whether the Kṣatriyas paid much attention to mental occupations is uncertain. In the latest stratum of the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] literature there are references to learned princes like '''[[जनक|Janaka]]''' of '''[[विदेह|Videha]],''' who is said to have become a Brahmin (''brahmā''), apparently in the sense that he had the full knowledge which a Brahmin possessed.<ref name=fx21_ve1_796/> Other learned Kṣatriyas of this period were  '''[[प्रवाहण जैवलि|Pravāhaṇa Jaivali]],'''<ref name=fx22_ve1_796/> '''[[अश्वपति|Aśvapati]] [[कैकेय|Kaikeya]],'''<ref name=fx23_ve1_796/> and [[अजातशत्रु|Ajātaśatru]].<ref name=fx24_ve1_796/> Garbe,<ref name=fx25_ve1_796/> Grierson,<ref name=fx26_ve1_796/> and others believe they are justified in holding the view that the Ksatriyas developed a special philosophy of their own as opposed to Brahminism, which appears later as Bhakti, or Faith. On the other hand, there is clear evidence<ref name=fx27_ve1_796/> that the opinion of Ksatriyas on such topics were held in little respect, and it must be remembered that to attribute wisdom to a king was a delicate and effective piece of flattery. There are earlier references to royal sages (''[[राजन्यर्षि|rājanyarṣi]]''),<ref name=fx28_ve1_796/> but it is very doubtful if much stress can be laid on them, and none can be laid on the later tradition of Sāyaṇa.<ref name=fx29_ve1_796/> Again, the [[निरुक्त|Nirukta]]<ref name=fx30_ve1_796/> gives a tradition relating how '''Devāpi,''' a king's son, became the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] of his younger brother '''[[शंतनु|Śaṃtanu]];''' but it is very doubtful if the story can really be traced with Sieg<ref name=fx31_ve1_796/> in the Rigveda<ref name=fx32_ve1_796/> itself. In any case, the stories refer only to a few selected Kṣatriyas of high rank, while there is no evidence that the average [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] was concerned with intellectual pursuits. Nor is there any reference to Kṣatriyas engaging in agriculture or in trade or commerce. It may be assumed that the duties of administration and war were adequate to absorb his attention. On the other hand, we do hear of a [[राजन्य|Rājanya]]  as a lute player and singer at the [[अश्वमेध|Aśvamedha]] or horse sacrifice.<ref name=fx33_ve1_796/><br><br>Of the training and education of a [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] we have no record; presumably, as in fact if not in theory later on, he was mainly instructed in the art of war, the science of the bow, and the rudimentary administrative functions which would devolve on him. At this early state of the development of the nobility which appears to be represented in the Rigveda, it was probably not unusual or impossible for a [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] to become a [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]]; at least, this assumption best explains the phrase<ref name=fx34_ve1_796/> ‘claiming falsely a Kṣatriya's rank’ (''kṣatriyaṃ mithuyā dhārayantam'').<br><br>The king and the Kṣatriyas must have stood in a particularly close relation. The former being the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] ''par excellence,'' it is to him rather than to the ordinary [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] that we must refer passages like that in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx35_ve1_796/> where it is said that the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]], with the consent of the clansmen, gives a settlement to a man: clearly a parallel to the rule found among many peoples that the chief, but only with the consent of the people, can make a grant of unoccupied land. In the same [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx36_ve1_796/> it is said that a [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] consecrates a [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]], a clear reference, as the commentator explains, to the practice of the old king consecrating the prince (''kumāra'') who is to succeed him; and again,<ref name=fx37_ve1_796/> the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] and the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] are regarded as alone complete in contrast with other people, the parallel with the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] here suggesting that the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] ''par excellence'' is meant. On the other hand, the king is sometimes contrasted with the [[राजन्य|Rājanya]].<ref name=fx38_ve1_796/><br><br>The [[सूत्र|Sūtra]] literature contains elaborate rules<ref name=fx39_ve1_796/> for the educa-  tion and occupations of Kṣatriyas, but their contents cannot always be traced in the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] literature, and their value is questionable.<br>

क्षुर|kṣura|kShura|క్షుర|ಕ್ಷುರ|xura|_vei1@805|_vei1_pn209

In the third passage<ref name=fx4_ve1_805/> there seems to be a reference to the sharpening of a razor on a grindstone<ref name=fx5_ve1_805/> (''bhurijos,'' the dual denoting precisely, as Pischel<ref name=fx6_ve1_805/> points out, the two sides of the apparatus, between which the stone revolved like the modern grindstone). But Muir,<ref name=fx7_ve1_805/> following another view of Roth,<ref name=fx8_ve1_805/> adopts the sense ‘the edge of scissors,’ which, however, hardly suits the other passage, one in the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx9_ve1_805/> where a [[क्षुर|Kṣura]] is described as moving about on the ''bhurijos,''<ref name=fx10_ve1_805/> as the tongue on the lip. The meaning ‘razor’ is perfectly clear in the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx11_ve1_805/> where shaving by means of it is mentioned; in many other passages<ref name=fx12_ve1_805/> either sense is adequate. A ''kṣuro bhṛjvān'' occurs in the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]]:<ref name=fx13_ve1_805/> it seems to denote, as Bloomfield<ref name=fx14_ve1_805/> suggests, a razor with a strop (in the shape of a small grinding apparatus).

Oldenberg,<ref name=fx6_ve1_831/> however, points out that the sense is rather the land which lay between cultivated fields, but which need not be deemed to have been unfertile, as Roth thought.

This view is consistent with the fact that the phrase '''[[यज्ञ-गाथा|Yajña-gāthā]],''' meaning a verse summarizing a sacrificial usage, is not rare. The Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx10_ve1_866/> preserves several Gāthās, which generally accord with this description as epitomizing the sacrifices of famous kings, and the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<ref name=fx11_ve1_866/> states that a [[गाथा|Gāthā]] is sung at a wedding.

The cows were milked thrice a day, early (''[[प्रातर्|prātar]]-doha''), in the forenoon ('''[[संगव|Saṃgava]]'''), and in the evening (''sāyaṃ-doha'').<ref name=fx3_ve1_891/> Thrice a day they were driven out to graze, according to the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx4_ve1_891/> (''prātaḥ, saṃgave, sāyam''). The first milking was productive, the last two scanty.<ref name=fx3_ve1_891/> According to the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx5_ve1_891/> among the Bharatas the herds in the evening are in the '''[[गोष्ठ|Goṣṭha]],''' at midday in the '''Saṃgavīnī.''' This passage Sāyaṇa expands by saying that the herds go home to the [[शाला|Śālā]], or house for animals, at night so far as they consist of animals giving milk, while the others stayed out in the [[गोष्ठ|Goṣṭha]], or open pasturage; but both were together in the cattle-shed during the heat of the day.

The marking of the ears of cattle was repeatedly adopted, no doubt, to indicate ownership.<ref name=fx11_ve1_891/><br><br>Large herds of cattle were well-known, as is shown by the Dānastutis, or ‘praises of gifts,’ in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx12_ve1_891/> even when allowances are made for the exaggeration of priestly gratitude. The importance attached to the possession of cattle is shown<ref name=fx13_ve1_891/> by the numerous passages in which the gods are asked to prosper them, and by the repeated prayers<ref name=fx14_ve1_891/> for wealth in kine. Hence, too, forays for cattle ('''[[गव्इष्टि|Gaviṣṭi]]''') were well known; the [[भरत|Bharata]] host is called the ‘horde desiring cows’ (''gavyan grāmaḥ'') in the Rigveda;<ref name=fx15_ve1_891/> and a verbal root ''gup,''<ref name=fx16_ve1_891/> ‘to protect,’ was evolved as early as the Rigveda from the denominative ''go-pāya,'' ‘to guard cows.’ The Vedic poets<ref name=fx17_ve1_891/> do not hesitate to compare their songs with the lowing of cows, or to liken the choir of the singing Apsarases to cows.<ref name=fx18_ve1_891/><br><br>The cattle of the Vedic period were of many colours: red (''[[रोहित|rohita]]''), light (''[[शुक्र|śukra]]''), dappled (''pṛśni''), even black (''[[कृष्ण|kṛṣṇa]]'').<ref name=fx19_ve1_891/> Zimmer<ref name=fx20_ve1_891/> sees a reference to cows with blazes on the face in one passage of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx21_ve1_891/> but this is uncertain.<br><br>Oxen were regularly used for ploughing or for drawing wagons (''[[अनड्वाह्|anaḍvāh]]''), in which case they were, it seems, usually castrated.<ref name=fx22_ve1_891/> Cows were not properly used for drawing carts, hough they at times did so.<ref name=fx23_ve1_891/> The flesh of both cows and bulls was sometimes eaten ('''Māmsa''').

Roth<ref name=fx2_ve1_896/> interprets the word as ‘cowstall,’ while Geldner<ref name=fx3_ve1_896/> thinks ‘herd’ is meant. The latter sense seems to explain best the employment which the term shows in the later literature as denoting the ‘family’ or ‘clan,’ and which is found in the Chāndogya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]].<ref name=fx4_ve1_896/><br><br>In the [[गृह्य|Gṛhya]] Sūtras<ref name=fx5_ve1_896/> stress is laid on the prohibition of  marriage within a [[गोत्र|Gotra]], or with a Sapiṇḍa of the mother of the bridegroom--that is to say, roughly, with agnates and cognates. Senart<ref name=fx6_ve1_896/> has emphasized this fact as a basis of caste, on the ground that marriage within a ''curia, phratria,'' or caste ('''[[वर्ण|Varṇa]]''') was Indo-European, as was marriage outside the circle of agnates and cognates. But there is no evidence at all<ref name=fx7_ve1_896/> to prove that this practice was Indo-European, while in India the Śatapatha<ref name=fx8_ve1_896/> expressly recognizes marriage within the third or fourth degree on either side. According to Sāyaṇa, the Kāṇvas accepted marriage in the third degree, the Saurāṣṭras only in the fourth, while the scholiast on the Vajrasūcī<ref name=fx9_ve1_896/> adḍs to the Kāṇvas the Andhras and the Dākṣiṇātyas, and remarks that the Vājasaneyins forbade marriage with the daughter of the mother's brother. All apparently allowed marriage with the daughter of a paternal uncle, which later was quite excluded. Change of [[गोत्र|Gotra]] was quite possible, as in the case of '''[[शुनःशेप|Śunaḥśepa]]''' and '''[[गृत्समद|Gṛtsamada]],''' who, once an Aṅgirasa, became a [[भार्गव|Bhārgava]].<ref name=fx10_ve1_896/><br>

<u>'''Graha'''</u> (‘seizing’) is a term applied to the sun in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx1_ve1_927/> most probably not in the later sense of ‘planet,’ but to denote a power exercising magical influence.<ref name=fx2_ve1_927/> The sense of ‘planet’ seems first to occur in the later literature, as in the Maitrāyaṇī [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]].<ref name=fx3_ve1_927/> The question whether the planets were known to the Vedic Indians is involved in obscurity. Oldenberg<ref name=fx4_ve1_927/> recognizes them in the Ādityas, whose number is, he believes, seven; sun, moon, and the five planets. But this view, though it cannot be said to be impossible or even unlikely, is not susceptible of proof, and has been rejected by Hillebrandt,<ref name=fx5_ve1_927/> Pischel,<ref name=fx6_ve1_927/> von Schroeder,<ref name=fx7_ve1_927/> Macdonell,<ref name=fx8_ve1_927/> and Bloomfield,<ref name=fx9_ve1_927/> among others. Hillebrandt<ref name=fx10_ve1_927/> sees the planets in the five Adhvaryus mentioned in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx11_ve1_927/> but this is a mere conjecture. The five bulls (''ukṣāṇaḥ'') in another passage of the Rigveda<ref name=fx12_ve1_927/> have received a similar interpretation with equal uncertainty,<ref name=fx13_ve1_927/> and [[दुर्ग|Durga]], in his commentary on the [[निरुक्त|Nirukta]],<ref name=fx14_ve1_927/> even explains the term ''bhūmija,'' ‘earth-born,’ which is only mentioned by [[यास्क|Yāska]], as meaning the planet Mars.<ref name=fx15_ve1_927/> Thibaut,<ref name=fx16_ve1_927/> who is generally sceptical as to the mention of planets in the Veda, thinks that [[बृहस्पति|Bṛhaspati]] there refers to Jupiter; but this is extremely improbable, though in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx17_ve1_927/> [[बृहस्पति|Bṛhaspati]] is made the regent of [[तिष्य|Tiṣya]].

ग्राम|grāma|graama|గ్రామ|ಗ್ರಾಮ|_vei1@929|_vei1_pn244
<u>'''Grāma.'''</u>--The primitive sense of this word, which occurs frequently from the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_929/> onwards, appears to have been ‘village.’ The Vedic Indians must have dwelt in villages which were scattered over the country, some close together,<ref name=fx2_ve1_929/> some far apart, and were connected by roads.<ref name=fx3_ve1_929/> The village is regularly contrasted with the forest (''[[अरण्य|araṇya]]''), and its animals and plants with those that lived or grew wild in the woods.<ref name=fx4_ve1_929/> The villages contained cattle, horses, and other domestic animals, as well as men.<ref name=fx5_ve1_929/> Grain was also stored in them.<ref name=fx6_ve1_929/> In the evening the cattle regularly returned thither from the forest.<ref name=fx7_ve1_929/> The villages were probably open, though perhaps a fort ('''Pur''') might on  occasion be built inside.<ref name=fx8_ve1_929/> Presumably they consisted of detached houses with enclosures, but no details are to be found in Vedic literature. Large villages (''mahāgrāmāḥ'') were known.<ref name=fx9_ve1_929/><br><br>The relation of the villagers is difficult to ascertain with precision. In several passages<ref name=fx10_ve1_929/> the word occurs with what appears to be the derivative sense of ‘body of men.’ This sense presumably started from the use of the word to denote the ‘village folk,’ as when '''[[शर्यात|Śaryāta]] [[मानव|Mānava]]''' is said in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx11_ve1_929/> to have wandered about with his ‘village’ (''grāmeṇa''); but, as Zimmer<ref name=fx12_ve1_929/> observes, this restricted sense nowhere appears clearly in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx13_ve1_929/> where indeed the ‘folk’ (''jana'')<ref name=fx14_ve1_929/> of the Bharatas is in one passage<ref name=fx15_ve1_929/> called the ‘horde seeking cows’ (''gavyan grāmaḥ''). Zimmer<ref name=fx16_ve1_929/> tends to regard the [[ग्राम|Grāma]] as a clan, and as standing midway between the family and the tribe ('''[[विश्|Viś]]'''). The [[ग्राम|Grāma]] may, however, perhaps be regarded more correctly<ref name=fx17_ve1_929/> as an aggregate of several families, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan ('''[[विश्|Viś]]'''), as is often the case at the present day.<ref name=fx18_ve1_929/><br><br>Vedic literature tells us very little about the social economy of the village. There is nothing to show that the community as such held land. What little evidence there is indicates that individual tenure of land was known (see '''[[उर्वरा|Urvarā]], [[क्षेत्र|Kṣetra]]'''), but this, in effect though not in law, presumably meant tenure by a family rather than by an individual person. The expression  ‘desirous of a village’ (''[[ग्राम|grāma]]-kāma''), which occurs frequently in the later Saṃhitās,<ref name=fx19_ve1_929/> points, however, to the practice of the king's granting to his favourites his royal prerogatives over villages so far as fiscal matters were concerned. Later<ref name=fx20_ve1_929/> the idea developed that the king was owner of all the land, and parallel with that idea the view that the holders of such grants were landlords. But of either idea there is no vestige in Vedic literature beyond the word ''[[ग्राम|grāma]]-kāma,'' which much more probably refers to the grant of regalia than to the grant of land, as Teutonic parallels show.<ref name=fx21_ve1_929/> Such grants probably tended to depress the position of the actual cultivators, and to turn them into tenants, but they can hardly have had this effect to any appreciable extent in early times.<br><br>The village does not appear to have been a unit for legal purposes in early days,<ref name=fx22_ve1_929/> and it can hardly be said to have been a political unit. The village no doubt, as later, included in its members various menials, besides the cultivating owners, and also the Brāhmaṇas and Kṣatriyas who might hold interest in it by royal grant or usage without actually cultivating land, such as chariot-makers ('''[[रथ-कार|Ratha-kāra]]'''), carpenters ('''[[तक्षन्|Takṣan]]'''), smiths ('''[[कर्मार|Karmāra]]'''), and others, but they did not presumably, in any sense, form part of the brotherhood.<ref name=fx23_ve1_929/> All alike were politically subject to the king, and bound to render him food or service or other tribute, unless he had transferred his rights to  others of the royal family or household, as was no doubt often the case, either in whole or part. The king's share in a village is referred to as early as the Atharvaveda.<ref name=fx24_ve1_929/><br><br>At the head of the village was the [[ग्राम|Grāma]]-ṇī, or ‘leader of the village,’ who is referred to in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx25_ve1_929/> and often in the later Saṃhitās and in the Brāhmaṇas.<ref name=fx26_ve1_929/> The exact meaning of the title is not certain. By Zimmer<ref name=fx27_ve1_929/> the Grāmaṇī is regarded as having had military functions only, and he is certainly often connected with the '''[[सेनानी|Senānī]],''' or ‘leader of an army.’ But there is no reason so to restrict the sense: presumably the Grāmaṇī was the head of the village both for civil purposes and for military operations. He is ranked in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx28_ve1_929/> as inferior to the '''[[सूत|Sūta]],''' or ‘charioteer,’ with whom, however, he is associated<ref name=fx29_ve1_929/> as one of the '''Ratnins,''' the ‘jewels’ of the royal establishment. The post was especially valuable to a [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]], who, if he attained it, was at the summit of prosperity (''gataśrī'').<ref name=fx30_ve1_929/> The Grāmaṇī's connexion with the royal person seems to point to his having been a nominee of the king rather than a popularly elected officer. But the post may have been sometimes hereditary, and sometimes nominated or elective: there is no decisive evidence available. The use of the singular presents difficulties: possibly the Grāmaṇī of the village or city where the royal residence was situated was specially honoured and influential.<ref name=fx31_ve1_929/> <br>

These astronomical conditions, he believes, existed in the time of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx11_ve1_969/> and prevailed in the fourth millennium B.C.

At the same time it must be remembered that the date was necessarily artificial, inasmuch as the year was divided into three seasons, each of four months, and the Indian year does not in fact consist of three equal seasons. The variations of the other datings would then not be unnatural if any school wished to defer its spring festival, the Vaiśvadeva, to the time when spring had really manifested itself.

The Rigveda<ref name=fx3_ve1_993/> represents him as an old decrepit man, to whom the Aśvins restored youth and strength, making him acceptable to his wife, and a husband of maidens.  The legend is given in another form in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx4_ve1_993/> where [[च्यवन|Cyavana]] is described as wedding [[सुकन्या|Sukanyā]], the daughter of '''[[शर्यात|Śaryāta]].''' He is there called a [[भृगु|Bhṛgu]] or [[आङ्गिरस|Āṅgirasa]], and is represented as having been rejuvenated by immersion in a pond--the first occurrence of a motive, later very common in Oriental literature.

This explanation of the hymn, suggested by Pischel,<ref name=fx6_ve1_993/> is corroborated by the Jaiminīya [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx7_ve1_993/> which relates that '''Vidanvant,''' another son of [[भृगु|Bhṛgu]], supported [[च्यवन|Cyavana]] against Indra, who was angry with him for sacrificing to the Aśvins; it is also noteworthy that the Aśvins appear in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx8_ve1_993/> as obtaining a share in the sacrifice on the suggestion of [[सुकन्या|Sukanyā]]. But a reconciliation of Indra and [[च्यवन|Cyavana]] must have taken place, because the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx9_ve1_993/> relates the inauguration of '''[[शार्यात|Śāryāta]]''' by [[च्यवन|Cyavana]] with the great Indra consecration (''aindreṇa mahābhiṣekeṇa'').

<u>'''1.

In a very late hymn of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx3_ve1_996/> as well as in one of the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx4_ve1_996/> the word is mentioned in the plural (''chandāṃsi''), beside Ṛc (''ṛcaḥ''), Sāman (''sāmāni''), and [[यजुस्|Yajus]], and seems to retain its original meaning, not improbably with reference to the magical subject-matter of the Atharvaveda. From denoting a (metrical) hymn it comes to mean ‘metre’ in a very late verse of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx5_ve1_996/> in which the ‘Gāyatrī, the Triṣṭubh, and all (''sarvā'') the metres (''chandāṃsi'') are mentioned.

जन|jana|జన|ಜನ|_vei1@1004|_vei1_pn269
<u>'''Jana,'''</u> besides meaning ‘man’ as an individual, with a tendency to the collective sense, commonly denotes a ‘people’ or ‘tribe’ in the Rigveda and later. Thus, the ‘five tribes’ ('''Panca Janāḥ''' or '''Janāsaḥ''') are frequently referred to, and in one hymn of the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_1004/> the ‘people of Yadu’ (''[[याद्व|yādva]] jana'') and the '''Yadus''' (''yādvāḥ'') are synonymous. Again, the king (''[[राजन्|rājan]]'') is described as ‘protector (''[[गोपा|gopā]]'') of the people (''janasya''),’<ref name=fx2_ve1_1004/> and there are other references to king and Jana.<ref name=fx3_ve1_1004/> The people of the '''Bharatas''' (''[[भारत|bhārata]] jana'') is also mentioned;<ref name=fx4_ve1_1004/> there is no ground to assume with Hopkins<ref name=fx5_ve1_1004/> that Jana in this case means a clan or horde ('''[[ग्राम|Grāma]]'''), as distinguished from a people.<br><br>It is difficult to say exactly how a people was divided. Zimmer<ref name=fx6_ve1_1004/> argues from a passage in the Rigveda<ref name=fx7_ve1_1004/> that a people was divided into cantons ('''[[विश्|Viś]]'''), cantons into joint families or clans, or village communities ('''[[ग्राम|Grāma]], [[वृजन|Vṛjana]]'''), and these again into single families. He thinks that the four divisions are reflected in the passage in question. by Jana, [[विश्|Viś]], [[जन्मन्|Janman]], and Putrāḥ, or sons, and argues that each village community was originally founded on relationship. But it is very doubtful whether this precise division of the people can be pressed. The division of the Jana into several [[विश्|Viś]] may be regarded as probable, for it is supported by the evidence of another passage of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx8_ve1_1004/> which mentions the [[विश्|Viś]] as a unit of the fighting men, and thus shows that, as in Homeric times and in ancient Germany, relationship was deemed a good principle of military arrangement. But the subdivision of the [[विश्|Viś]] into several Grāmas is very doubtful. Zimmer<ref name=fx9_ve1_1004/> admits that neither [[ग्राम|Grāma]]<ref name=fx10_ve1_1004/>  nor '''[[वृजन|Vṛjana]]'''<ref name=fx11_ve1_1004/> has the special sense of a subdivision of the [[विश्|Viś]] when used for war, for both words only denote generally an armed host. He finds other designations of the village host in '''Vrā'''<ref name=fx12_ve1_1004/> and in '''Vrāja,'''<ref name=fx13_ve1_1004/> but it is sufficient to say that the former passage is of extremely doubtful import,<ref name=fx14_ve1_1004/> and that the latter has no reference to war at all. It is therefore impossible to state in what exact relation the [[ग्राम|Grāma]] in Vedic times stood to the [[विश्|Viś]] or to the family (Kula or [[गोत्र|Gotra]]). The confusion is increased by the vagueness of the sense of both [[ग्राम|Grāma]] and [[विश्|Viś]]. If the latter be regarded as a local division, then no doubt the [[ग्राम|Grāma]] must have been a part of a district; but if a [[विश्|Viś]] was a unit of relationship, then a [[ग्राम|Grāma]] may have contained families of different Viśes, or may have sometimes coincided with a [[विश्|Viś]], or have contained only a part of a [[विश्|Viś]]. But in any case the original state of affairs must have been greatly modified by the rise of the system of caste, and the substitution of a hierarchical for a political point of view. The elements of the people were represented by the family--either as an individual family inhabiting one home ('''Kula'''), and consisting often, no doubt, of a joint family of brothers, or as a patriarchal family of sons who still lived with their father--and by the clan, the later '''[[गोत्र|Gotra]],''' which included all those who claimed a common ancestor. The [[गोत्र|Gotra]] may be regarded as roughly corresponding to the Latin ''gens'' and the Greek , and possibly the [[विश्|Viś]] may be the equivalent of the ''curia'' and, and the Jana of the ''tribus'' and  or .<ref name=fx15_ve1_1004/> These three divisions may also be seen in the [[विश्|Viś]], Zantu, and Daqyu of the Iranian world, where the use of [[विश्|Viś]] suggests that in the Indian [[विश्|Viś]] a relationship based on blood rather than locality is meant--and perhaps even in the ''vicus, pagus,'' and ''civitas'' of the old German polity described in the Germania<ref name=fx16_ve1_1004/> of Tacitus. The family in some form appears as the third element of the Jana in a passage of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx17_ve1_1004/> where the house (''[[गृह|gṛha]]'') is  contrasted with the Jana and the [[विश्|Viś]]. Possibly, too, another passage<ref name=fx18_ve1_1004/> contrasts the ''adhvara,'' or family sacrifice, with that of the Jana or [[विश्|Viś]], rather than, as Zimmer<ref name=fx19_ve1_1004/> thinks, the village with the two larger units. But it is significant of the particularism of the Vedic Indians that while the king maintained a fire which might be regarded as the sacred fire of the tribe, there is no sure trace<ref name=fx20_ve1_1004/> of any intermediate cult between that of the king and that of the individual householder. The real elements in the state are the [[गोत्र|Gotra]] and the Jana, just as ultimately the ''gens'' and ''tribus,'' the  and  are alone important. It may be that [[विश्|Viś]] sometimes represents in the older texts what later was known as the [[गोत्र|Gotra]]. See '''[[विश्|Viś]].'''<br><br>This appears clearly when the constitution of society in the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] period is considered. The tribe or people still exists, and is presupposed, but the division into [[विश्|Viś]] disappears. The real division is now the separate castes ('''[[वर्ण|Varṇa]]'''), but the numerous sections into which each of them is divided appear to be based in part on the ancient [[गोत्र|Gotra]].<br>

<u>'''Janaka,'''</u> king of [[विदेह|Videha]], plays a considerable part in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx1_ve1_1006/> and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]],<ref name=fx2_ve1_1006/> as well as in the Jaiminīya [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx3_ve1_1006/> and the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]].<ref name=fx4_ve1_1006/> He was a contemporary of '''[[याज्ञवल्क्य|Yājñavalkya]] [[वाज|Vāja]]-  saneya,'''<ref name=fx5_ve1_1006/> of '''[[श्वेतकेतु|Śvetaketu]] [[आरुणेय|Āruṇeya]],''' and of other sages.<ref name=fx6_ve1_1006/> He had become famous for his generosity and his interest in the discussion of the nature of [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]], as ultimate basis of reality, in the life-time of '''[[अजातशत्रु|Ajātaśatru]]''' of [[काशि|Kāśi]].<ref name=fx7_ve1_1006/> It is significant that he maintained a close intercourse with the Brahmins of the Kuru-Pañcālas, such as [[याज्ञवल्क्य|Yājñavalkya]] and [[श्वेतकेतु|Śvetaketu]]; for this indicates that the home of the philosophy of the Upaniṣads was in the Kuru-[[पञ्चाल|Pañcāla]] country rather than in the east. There is a statement in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx8_ve1_1006/> that he became a Brahmin (''brahmā''). This does not, however, signify a change of caste, but merely that in knowledge he became a Brahmin (see '''[[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]]'''). [[जनक|Janaka]] is occasionally mentioned in later texts: in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx9_ve1_1006/> he has already become quite mythical; in the [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx10_ve1_1006/> a ''sapta-rātra'' or seven nights' rite is ascribed to him.<br><br>It is natural to attempt to date [[जनक|Janaka]] by his being a contemporary of [[अजातशत्रु|Ajātaśatru]], and by identifying the latter with the Ajātasattu of the Pāli texts:<ref name=fx11_ve1_1006/> this would make the end of the sixth century B.C. the approximate date of [[जनक|Janaka]].<ref name=fx12_ve1_1006/> But it is very doubtful whether this identification can be supported: [[अजातशत्रु|Ajātaśatru]] was king of [[काशि|Kāśi]], whereas Ajātasattu was king of [[मगध|Magadha]], and his only connexion with [[काशि|Kāśi]] was through his marriage with the daughter of Pasenadi of [[कोसल|Kosala]].<ref name=fx13_ve1_1006/> Moreover, the acceptance of this chronology would be difficult to reconcile with the history of the development of thought; for it would make the rise of Buddhism contemporaneous with the Upaniṣads, whereas it is reasonably certain that the older Upaniṣads preceded Buddhism.<ref name=fx14_ve1_1006/> Nor do the Vedic texts know anything of Bimbisāra or Pasenadi, or any of the other princes famed in Buddhist records. <br><br>The identification<ref name=fx15_ve1_1006/> of [[जनक|Janaka]] of [[विदेह|Videha]] and the father of [[सीता|Sītā]] is less open to objection, but it cannot be proved, and is somewhat doubtful.

तक्मन्|takman|తక్మన్|ತಕ್ಮನ್|_vei1@1095|_vei1_pn294
<u>'''Takman'''</u> is a disease repeatedly mentioned in the Atharvaveda, but later not known under this name. It is the subject of five hymns<ref name=fx1_ve1_1095/> of the Atharvaveda, and is often mentioned elsewhere.<ref name=fx2_ve1_1095/> Weber<ref name=fx3_ve1_1095/> first identified it with ‘fever,’ and Grohmann<ref name=fx4_ve1_1095/> showed that all the symptoms pointed to that ailment.<ref name=fx5_ve1_1095/> Reference is made to the alternate hot and shivering fits of the patient,<ref name=fx6_ve1_1095/> to the yellow colour of the jaundice which accompanies the fever,<ref name=fx7_ve1_1095/> and to its peculiar periodicity. The words used to describe its varieties are ''anye-dyuḥ,''<ref name=fx8_ve1_1095/> ''ubhaya-dyuḥ,''<ref name=fx9_ve1_1095/> ''[[तृतीयक|tṛtīyaka]],''<ref name=fx10_ve1_1095/> ''vi-tṛtīya,''<ref name=fx11_ve1_1095/> and ''sadaṃ-di,''<ref name=fx12_ve1_1095/> the exact sense of most of which terms is somewhat uncertain. It is agreed<ref name=fx13_ve1_1095/> that the first epithet designates the fever known as ''quotidianus,'' which recurs each day at the same hour, though the word is curious (lit.  ‘on the other--''i.e.,'' next, day’). The ''ubhaya-dyuḥ'' (‘on both days’) variety appears to mean a disease recurring for two successive days, the third being free; this corresponds to the ''rhythmus quartanus complicatus.''<ref name=fx14_ve1_1095/> But Sāyaṇa considers that it means a fever recurring on the third day, the ‘tertian.’ The ''[[तृतीयक|tṛtīyaka]],'' however, must be the ‘tertian’ fever,<ref name=fx15_ve1_1095/> though Zimmer<ref name=fx16_ve1_1095/> suggests that it may mean a fever which is fatal at the third paroxysm. Grohmann<ref name=fx17_ve1_1095/> regards the ''vi-[[तृतीयक|tṛtīyaka]]'' as equivalent to the ''tertiana duplicata,'' a common form in southern countries, in which the fever occurs daily, but with a correspondence in point of time or severity of attack on alternate days. Bloomfield<ref name=fx18_ve1_1095/> suggests that it is identical with the ''ubhaya-dyuḥ'' variety. The ''sadaṃ-di''<ref name=fx19_ve1_1095/> type appears to be the kind later known as ''saṃtata-jvara'' (‘continuous fever’), in which there are attacks of several days’ duration, with an interval followed by a fresh period of attack. Fever occurred at different seasons, in the autumn (''[[शारद|śārada]]''), in the hot weather (''graiṣma''), in the rains (''vārṣika''),<ref name=fx20_ve1_1095/> but was especially prevalent in the first, as is indicated by the epithet ''viśva-[[शारद|śārada]],'' ‘occurring every autumn.’<ref name=fx21_ve1_1095/><br><br>The disease is said to arise when Agni enters the waters.<ref name=fx22_ve1_1095/> From this Weber<ref name=fx23_ve1_1095/> deduced that it was considered to be the result of a chill supervening on heat, or the influence of heat on marshy land. Grohmann<ref name=fx24_ve1_1095/> preferred to see in this connexion of the origin of the disease with Agni's entering the waters<ref name=fx25_ve1_1095/> an allusion to the fact that fever arises in the rainy season, the time when Agni, as lightning, descends to earth with the rain. Zimmer.<ref name=fx26_ve1_1095/> who accepts this view, further refers to the prevalence  of fever in the Terai, and interprets ''vanya,'' an epithet of fever found in the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx27_ve1_1095/> as meaning ‘sprung from the forest,’ pointing out that fever is mentioned as prevalent among the '''Mūjavants''' and '''Mahāvṛṣas,''' two mountain tribes of the western Himālaya.<ref name=fx28_ve1_1095/> There is no trace of fever having been observed to be caused by the bite of the ''anopheles'' mosquito, which breeds in stagnant water: this theory has without reason been held to be known to classical Indian medicine.<ref name=fx29_ve1_1095/><br><br>Among the symptoms of [[तक्मन्|Takman]], or among complications accompanying it, are mentioned ‘itch’ ('''[[पामन्|Pāman]]'''), ‘headache’ (''śīrṣa-śoka''),<ref name=fx30_ve1_1095/> ‘cough’ ('''Kāsikā'''), and ‘consumption,’ or perhaps some form of itch ('''[[बलास|Balāsa]]''').<br><br>It is perhaps significant that the [[तक्मन्|Takman]] does not appear until the Atharvaveda. It is quite possible that the Vedic Āryans, when first settled in India, did not know the disease, which would take some generations to become endemic and recognized as dangerous. What remedies they used against it is quite uncertain, for the Atharvaveda mentions only spells and the '''[[कुष्ठ|Kuṣṭha]],''' which can hardly have been an effective remedy, though still used in later times. Fever must, even in the [[अथर्वन्|Atharvan]] period, have claimed many victims, or it would not be mentioned so prominently.<br>

In another passage of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx6_ve1_1124/> however, the dog is told to bark at the [[तस्कर|Taskara]] or the [[स्तेन|Stena]], which clearly points to an attempt at house-breaking.

<u>'''Tirindira'''</u> is mentioned in a Dānastuti, or ‘Praise of Gifts,’ in the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_1154/> as having, along with '''[[पर्शु|Parśu]],''' bestowed gifts on the singer. In the [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx2_ve1_1154/> this statement is represented by a tale that the [[कण्व|Kaṇva]] [[वत्स|Vatsa]] obtained a gift from [[तिरिन्दिर|Tirindira]] [[पारशव्य|Pāraśavya]], [[तिरिन्दिर|Tirindira]] and [[पर्शु|Parśu]] being in this version thus treated as one and the same man. Ludwig<ref name=fx3_ve1_1154/> sees in the Rigvedic passage a proof that the Yadus had gained a victory over [[तिरिन्दिर|Tirindira]], and gave a part of the booty to the singers; but there is no proof whatever of the correctness of this interpretation, which Zimmer<ref name=fx4_ve1_1154/> shows to be most unlikely. Yadu princes must be meant by [[तिरिन्दिर|Tirindira]] and  [[पर्शु|Parśu]], though Weber<ref name=fx5_ve1_1154/> thinks that the singers were Yadus, not the princes. The latter he holds to have been Iranian (''cf.'', and see '''[[पर्शु|Parśu]]'''), and he thinks that in this there is evidence of continual close relations between India and Iran. This is perfectly possible, but the evidence for it is rather slight.(**  6 For the recent controversy as to Iranian names found at Boghaz-kio7i, ''cf.'' Jacobi, ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,'' 1909, 721 ''et seq.;'' Oldenberg, ''ibid.,'' 1095-1100; Keith, ''ibid.,'' 1100-1106; Sayce, ''ibid.,'' 1106, 1107; Kennedy, ''ibid.,'' 1107-1119. Hillebrandt, ''Vedische Mythologie,'' 1, 94 ''et seq.,'' argues in favour of an early connexion of Iranians and Indians in Arachosia, where he places part of the action of the Rigveda. Hopkins, ''Journal of the American Oriental Society,'' 17, 16, 277, holds that traces of Iranian connexion are signs of late date; Arnold, ''ibid.,'' 18, 205 ''et seq.,'' opposes this view.<br>

<u>'''Turvaśa'''</u> occurs frequently in the Rigveda as the name of a man or of a people, usually in connexion with '''Yadu.''' The two words usually occur in the singular without any connecting particle, ''[[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] Yadu'' or ''Yadu [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]].''<ref name=fx2_ve1_1171/> In a plural form the name [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] occurs once with the Yadus,<ref name=fx3_ve1_1171/> and once alone<ref name=fx4_ve1_1171/> in a hymn in which the singular has already been used. In one passage<ref name=fx5_ve1_1171/> the dual ''Turvaśā-Yadū'' actually occurs, and in another<ref name=fx6_ve1_1171/> ''Yadus Turvaś ca,'' ‘Yadu and [[तुर्व|Turva]].’ In other passages<ref name=fx7_ve1_1171/> [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] appears alone, while in one<ref name=fx8_ve1_1171/> [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] and [[याद्व|Yādva]] occur.<br><br>From these facts Hopkins<ref name=fx9_ve1_1171/> deduces the erroneousness of the ordinary view,<ref name=fx10_ve1_1171/> according to which [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] is the name of a tribe, the singular denoting the king, and regards [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] as the name of the Yadu king. But the evidence for this is not conclusive. Without laying any stress on the argument based on the theory<ref name=fx11_ve1_1171/> that the ‘five peoples’ of the Rigveda are the '''Anus, Druhyus,''' Turvaśas, Yadus, and '''Pūrus,''' it is perfectly reasonable to hold that the Turvaśas and Yadus were two distinct though closely allied tribes. Such they evidently were to the seers of the hymns which mention in the dual the ''Turvaśā-Yadū'' and speak of ''Yadus Turvaś ca.'' This explanation also suits best the use of the plural of [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] in two Rigvedic hymns.<br><br>In the Rigveda the chief exploit of [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] was his participation in the war against '''[[सुदास्|Sudās]],''' by whom he was defeated.<ref name=fx12_ve1_1171/> Hopkins<ref name=fx13_ve1_1171/> suggests that he may have been named [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] because of his fleet (''tura'') escape from the battle.

In vii. 18, 6, [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] is joined with [[यक्षु|Yakṣu]], apparently a contemptuous variant of Yadu (Hopkins, ''Journal of the American Oriental Society,'' 15, 261). ''Cf.'' '''[[तृत्सु|Tṛtsu]].'''  may have been assisted by Indra, for in some passages<ref name=fx14_ve1_1171/> Indra's aid to [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] (and) Yadu is referred to; it is also significant that the Anu, and apparently the [[द्रुह्यु|Druhyu]], kings are mentioned as having been drowned in the defeat, but not the [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] and Yadu kings, and that [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] appears in the eighth book of the Rigveda as a worshipper of Indra with the Anu prince, the successor, presumably, of the one who was drowned.<ref name=fx15_ve1_1171/> Griffith,<ref name=fx16_ve1_1171/> however, proposes to refer these passages to a defeat by [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] and Yadu of Arṇa and [[चित्ररथ|Citraratha]] on the '''[[सरयु|Sarayu]];'''<ref name=fx17_ve1_1171/> but the evidence for this is quite inadequate.<br><br>Two passages of the Rigveda<ref name=fx18_ve1_1171/> seem to refer to an attack by [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] and Yadu on '''Divodāsa,''' the father of [[सुदास्|Sudās]].

But as this evidence for the identification of the Turvaśas with the Vṛcīvants is not clear, it seems sufficient<ref name=fx22_ve1_1171/> to assume that they were allies.<br><br>Later, in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx23_ve1_1171/> the Turvaśas appear as allies of the Pañcālas, [[तौर्वश|Taurvaśa]] horses, thirty-three in number, and armed men, to the number of 6,000, being mentioned.<ref name=fx24_ve1_1171/> But otherwise the name disappears: this lends  probability to Oldenberge's conjecture<ref name=fx25_ve1_1171/> that the Turvaśas became merged in the '''[[पञ्चाल|Pañcāla]]''' people. Hopkins<ref name=fx26_ve1_1171/> considers that in the Śatapatha passage the horses were merely named from the family of [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]]; but this view is less likely, since it ignores the difficulty involved in the reference to the men.<br><br>It is impossible to be certain regarding the home of the Turvaśas at the time of their conflict with [[सुदास्|Sudās]].

<u>'''Tṛtsu'''</u> occurs in the Rigveda, once in the singular<ref name=fx1_ve1_1187/> and several times in the plural,<ref name=fx2_ve1_1187/> as a proper name. The Tṛtsus were clearly helpers of '''[[सुदास्|Sudās]]''' in the great battle against the ten kings, '''[[शिम्यु|Śimyu]],''' the '''[[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]],''' the '''[[द्रुह्यु|Druhyu]], [[कवष|Kavaṣa]],''' the '''[[पूरु|Pūru]],''' the '''Anu, [[भेद|Bheda]], [[शम्बर|Śambara]],''' the two '''Vaikarṇas,''' and perhaps the '''Yadu,''' who led with them as allies<ref name=fx3_ve1_1187/> the '''Matsyas, Pakthas, [[भलानस्|Bhalānas]], Alinas, Viṣāṇins, Śivas, Ajas, Śigrus,''' and perhaps Yakṣus.<ref name=fx4_ve1_1187/> The defeat of the ten kings is celebrated in one  hymn of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx5_ve1_1187/> and is evidently alluded to in two others.<ref name=fx6_ve1_1187/> The great battle took place on the '''[[परुष्णी|Paruṣṇī]],''' but there was also a fight on the '''[[यमुना|Yamunā]]''' with [[भेद|Bheda]], the Ajas, Śigrus, and Yakṣus. As the [[यमुना|Yamunā]] and the Parusṇī represent opposite ends of the territory of the Tṛtsus (for we cannot with Hopkins<ref name=fx7_ve1_1187/> safely identify the streams), it is difficult to see exactly how the ten kings could be confederated, but it should be noted that the references to the ten kings occur in the two later hymns,<ref name=fx6_ve1_1187/> and not in the hymn<ref name=fx5_ve1_1187/> describing the battle itself; besides, absolute numerical accuracy cannot be insisted upon.<br><br>It is difficult exactly to determine the character of the Tṛtsus; especially in their relation to the Bharatas, who under Viśvāmitra's guidance are represented as prospering and as advancing to the '''[[विपाश्|Vipāś]]''' and '''[[शुतुद्री|Śutudrī]].'''<ref name=fx8_ve1_1187/> Roth ingeniously brought this into connexion with the defeat of his enemies by [[सुदास्|Sudās]], which is celebrated in the seventh book of the Rigveda--a book attributed to the [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] family--and thought that there was a reference in one verse<ref name=fx9_ve1_1187/> to the defeat of the Bharatas by [[सुदास्|Sudās]]. But it seems certain that the verse is mistranslated, and that the Bharatas are really represented as victors with [[सुदास्|Sudās]].<ref name=fx10_ve1_1187/> Ludwig<ref name=fx11_ve1_1187/> accordingly identifies the Tṛtsus and the Bharatas. Oldenberg,<ref name=fx12_ve1_1187/> after accepting this view at first,<ref name=fx13_ve1_1187/> later expressed the opinion that the Tṛtsus were the priests of the [[भरत|Bharata]] people, and therefore identical with the Vasiṣṭhas. This view is supported by the fact that in one passage<ref name=fx14_ve1_1187/> the Tṛtsus are clearly described as wearing their hair in the peculiar manner affected by the Vasiṣṭhas,<ref name=fx15_ve1_1187/> and would in that passage thus seem to represent the Vasiṣṭhas.  But Geldner<ref name=fx16_ve1_1187/> has suggested with great probability that [[तृत्सु|Tṛtsu]], who is once mentioned in the singular,<ref name=fx17_ve1_1187/> means the [[तृत्सु|Tṛtsu]] king--that is, [[सुदास्|Sudās]].<ref name=fx18_ve1_1187/> This explanation alone justifies the description<ref name=fx19_ve1_1187/> of the Bharatas as ''Tṛtsūnāṃ viśaḥ,''<ref name=fx20_ve1_1187/> ‘subjects of the Tṛtsus,’ meaning the [[तृत्सु|Tṛtsu]] [[गोत्र|Gotra]] or family, for the people could not be said to be subjects of a body of priests. The Vasiṣṭhas might be called Tṛtsus because of their close connexion with the royal house of that people. The reverse process is also quite possible, but is rendered improbable by the fact that the '''Pratṛdaḥ''' are referred to as receiving [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]].<ref name=fx21_ve1_1187/> This name of the [[तृत्सु|Tṛtsu]] dynasty is probably older than its connexion with [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] in the time of [[सुदास्|Sudās]], a conclusion supported by the name of '''[[प्रतर्दन|Pratardana]],''' who is mentioned later as a descendant of Divodāsa,<ref name=fx22_ve1_1187/> an ancestor of [[सुदास्|Sudās]]. The [[तृत्सु|Tṛtsu]] dynasty could therefore hardly have been referred to as Vasiṣṭhas. For the further history of the dynasty and its relation with [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] and [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]], see '''[[सुदास्|Sudās]].'''<br><br>If the Tṛtsus and their subjects, the Bharatas, were in the Rigvedic period at war with the tribes on either side of the territory between the [[परुष्णी|Paruṣṇī]] and the [[यमुना|Yamunā]], it is clear<ref name=fx23_ve1_1187/> that later on they coalesced with the Pūrus and probably others of those tribes to form the '''Kuru''' people. Already in the Rigveda<ref name=fx24_ve1_1187/> the Tṛtsus are allied with the '''Sṛñjayas,''' and in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx25_ve1_1187/> one [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] serves both Kurus and Sṛñjayas. <br><br>Hillebrandt<ref name=fx26_ve1_1187/> considers that the Tṛtsus cannot be identified with the Bharatas, but that [[सुदास्|Sudās]] and the Bharatas represent an invading body, which, however, became allied with the Tṛtsus and the [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] priests. He also thinks that the Rigveda reveals a time when '''Divodāsa,''' the grandfather or ancestor of [[सुदास्|Sudās]], was living in Arachosia, on the '''[[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]],''' and warring against the '''Paṇis,''' whom he identifies with the Parnians. But this conjecture<ref name=fx27_ve1_1187/> cannot be regarded as probable. In the [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]]<ref name=fx28_ve1_1187/> it is not necessary to see any other river than the later [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]], in the middle country, which flowed within the boundaries of the Tṛtsus: it is also significant that there are references<ref name=fx29_ve1_1187/> to contests between '''[[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]] Yadu''' and [[अतिथिग्व|Atithigva]] or Divodāsa. Thus there is no reason to doubt that Divodāsa and the Bharatas were in the middle country, and not in Iran.<br>

Trasadasyu's chronological position is determined by the fact that his father, [[पुरुकुत्स|Purukutsa]], was a contemporary of [[सुदास्|Sudās]], either as an opponent<ref name=fx7_ve1_1206/> or as a friend.<ref name=fx8_ve1_1206/> That [[पुरुकुत्स|Purukutsa]] was an enemy of [[सुदास्|Sudās]] is more probable, because the latter's predecessor, Divodāsa, was apparently<ref name=fx9_ve1_1206/> at enmity with the Pūrus, and in the battle of the ten kings Pūrus were ranged against [[सुदास्|Sudās]] and the Tṛtsus.

<u>'''Tri-yuga,'''</u> neut., is an expression occurring in the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_1217/> where it is said that the plants (''[[ओषधि|oṣadhi]]'') were born ‘three ages’ before the gods (''devebhyas triyugaṃ purā''). The commentator on the [[निरुक्त|Nirukta]]<ref name=fx2_ve1_1217/> thinks that the ages here meant are the Yugas of the later Indian chronology, the sense of the passage being that the plants were born in the first Yuga. The author of the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx3_ve1_1217/> understands three seasons--spring, the rains, and autumn--to be meant in the verse, taking the two words ''triyugaṃ purā'' separately as ‘formerly, in the three seasons.’ The vague sense ‘three ages’ is quite adequate: the use of ‘three’ in such cases is a favourite feature in folklore.

He was out in his chariot with his [[पुरोहित|Purohita]], or domestic priest, '''[[वृश जान|Vṛśa Jāna]],''' and by excessive speed in driving killed a Brahmin boy. This sin was atoned for by the Purohita's using his Vārśa Sāman (chant). The [[शाट्यायन|Śāṭyāyana]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], cited by Sāyaṇa,<ref name=fx3_ve1_1229/> elaborates the tale. As Vṛśa had held the reins, king and priest accused each other of the murder. The Ikṣvākus being consulted threw the responsibility for the crime on Vṛśa, who thereupon revived the boy by the Vārśa Sāman. In consequence of this unfairness of theirs--being Kṣatriyas they were partial to a [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]]--Agni's glow ceased to burn in their houses. In response to their appeal to restore it, Vṛśa came to them, saw the Piśācī (demoness), who, in the form of Trasadasyu's wife, had stolen the glow, and succeeded in restoring it to Agni. This version with some variations occurs also in the Bṛhaddevatā,<ref name=fx4_ve1_1229/> which connects the story with a hymn of the Rigveda.<ref name=fx5_ve1_1229/> Sieg's attempt<ref name=fx6_ve1_1229/> to show that the hymn really refers to this tale is not at all successful.<ref name=fx7_ve1_1229/> <br><br>It is clear that [[त्रसदस्यु|Trasadasyu]] must here mean ‘descendant of [[त्रसदस्यु|Trasadasyu]],’ and not King [[त्रसदस्यु|Trasadasyu]] himself. The difference of the patronymics, [[त्रैवृष्ण|Traivṛṣṇa]] and [[त्रैधात्व|Traidhātva]], by which he is referred to can best be explained by assuming that there were two kings, Trivṛṣan and Tridhātu (or possibly Tridhanvan), from whom Tryaruṇa was descended.<ref name=fx8_ve1_1229/> The connexion with the Ikṣvākus is important (see '''[[इक्ष्वाकु|Ikṣvāku]]''').<br>

दशन्|daśan|dashan|దశన్|ದಶನ್|_vei1@1266|_vei1_pn342
<u>'''Daśan,'''</u> ‘ten,’ forms the basis of the numerical system of the Vedic Indians, as it does of the Āryan people generally. But it is characteristic of India<ref name=fx1_ve1_1266/> that there should be found at a very early period long series of names for very high numerals, whereas the Āryan knowledge did not go beyond 1,000. In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<ref name=fx2_ve1_1266/> the list is 1; 10; 100; 1,000; 10,000 (''ayuta''); 100,000 (''niyuta''); 1,000,000 (''prayuta''); 10,000,000 (''[[अर्बुद|arbuda]]''); 100,000,000 (''nyarbuda''); 1,000,000,000 (''[[सम्उद्र|samudra]]''); 10,000,000,000 (''madhya''); 100,000,000,000 (''anta''); 1,000,000,000,000 (''parārdha''). In the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx3_ve1_1266/> the list is the same, but ''niyuta'' and ''prayuta'' exchange places, and after ''nyarbuda'' a new figure (''badva'') intervenes, thus increasing ''[[सम्उद्र|samudra]]'' to 10,000,000,000, and so on. The [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā has in two places<ref name=fx4_ve1_1266/> exactly the same list as the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. The Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<ref name=fx5_ve1_1266/> has the list ''ayuta, prayuta,'' then ''ayuta'' again, ''[[अर्बुद|arbuda]], nyarbuda, [[सम्उद्र|samudra]], madhya, anta, parārdha.'' The [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx6_ve1_1266/> has the Vājasaneyi list up to ''nyarbuda'' inclusive, then follow ''nikharvaka, badva, akṣita,'' and apparently ''go'' = 1,000,000,000,000. The Jaiminīya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx7_ve1_1266/> list  replaces ''nikharvaka'' by ''nikharva, badva'' by ''padma,'' and ends with ''akṣitir vyomāntaḥ.'' The [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx8_ve1_1266/> continues the series after ''nyarbuda'' with ''nikharvāda, [[सम्उद्र|samudra]], salila, antya, ananta'' (= 10 billions).<br><br>But beyond ''ayuta''<ref name=fx9_ve1_1266/> none of these numbers has any vitality. ''Badva,'' indeed, occurs in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx10_ve1_1266/> but it cannot there have any precise numerical sense;<ref name=fx11_ve1_1266/> and later on the names of these high numerals are very much confused.<br><br>An arithmetical progression of some interest is found in the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx12_ve1_1266/> where occurs a list of sacrificial gifts in which each successive figure doubles the amount of the preceding one. It begins with ''[[द्वादश|dvādaśa]]-mānaṃ hiraṇyam,'' ‘gold to the value of 12’ (the unit being uncertain, but probably the '''[[कृष्णल|Kṛṣṇala]]'''),<ref name=fx13_ve1_1266/> followed by ‘to the value of 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, 768, 1,536, 3072,’ then ''dve aṣṭāviṃśati-śata-māne,'' which must mean 2×128×24 (the last unit being not a single ''[[मान|māna]],'' but a number of 24 ''mānas'') = 6,144, then 12,288, 24,576, 49,152, 98,304, 196,608, 393, 216. With these large numbers may be compared the minute theoretical subdivision of time found in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx14_ve1_1266/> where a day is divided into 15 ''muhūrtas''--1 ''[[मुहूर्त|muhūrta]]'' = 15 ''kṣipras,'' 1 ''kṣipra'' = 15 ''etarhis,'' 1 ''etarhi'' = 15 ''idānis,'' 1 ''idāni'' = 15 ''prāṇas.'' The [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx15_ve1_1266/> has a decimal division of the day into 15 ''muhūrtas''-1 ''[[मुहूर्त|muhūrta]]'' = 10 ''nimeṣas,'' 1 ''nimeṣa'' = 10 ''dhvaṃsis.''<br><br>Few fractions are mentioned in Vedic literature. ''Ardha, [[पाद|pāda]], [[शफ|śapha]],'' and ''[[कला|kalā]]'' denote (1/2), (1/4), (1/8), (1/16) respectively, but only  the first two are common. ''Tṛtīya'' denotes the third part.<ref name=fx16_ve1_1266/> In the Rigveda<ref name=fx17_ve1_1266/> Indra and Viṣṇu are said to have divided 1,000 by 3, though how they did so is uncertain.

The word may have originally meant ‘ravaged land’<ref name=fx16_ve1_1279/> as a result of invasion; hence ‘enemies’ country,' then ‘hostile people,’ who as human foes were more usually called by the cognate name of '''[[दास|Dāsa]].'''<br><br>Individual Dasyus are '''[[चुमुरि|Cumuri]], [[शम्बर|Śambara]], Śuṣṇa,''' etc.<br><br>In the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx17_ve1_1279/> the word has, as later,<ref name=fx18_ve1_1279/> the sense of uncivilized peoples generally.<br>

The passages all negative the idea that the property of the family was legally family property: it is clear that it was the property of the head of the house, usually the father, and that the other members of the family only had moral claims upon it which the father could ignore, though he might be coerced by his sons if they were physically stronger.<br><br>Thus '''Manu''' is said in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx2_ve1_1289/> to have divided his property among his sons. He omitted '''[[नाभानेदिष्ठ|Nābhānediṣṭha]],'''  whom he afterwards taught how to appease the Aṅgirases, and to procure cows. This is a significant indication that the property he divided was movable property, rather than land ('''[[उर्वरा|Urvarā]]'''). In the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx3_ve1_1289/> the division is said to have been made during Manu's lifetime by his sons, who left only their aged father to [[नाभानेदिष्ठ|Nābhānediṣṭha]].

The [[दास|Dāsa]] colour ('''[[वर्ण|Varṇa]]''')<ref name=fx6_ve1_1305/> is probably an allusion to the black skin of the aborigines, which is also directly mentioned.<ref name=fx7_ve1_1305/> The aborigines (as Dasyus) are called ''[[अनास्|anās]],'' ‘noseless’(?),<ref name=fx8_ve1_1305/> and ''[[मृध्र-वाच्|mṛdhra-vāc]],'' ‘of hostile speech,’<ref name=fx9_ve1_1305/> and are probably meant by the phallus-worshippers (''śiśna-devāḥ,'' ‘whose deity is a phallus’) of the Rigveda.<ref name=fx10_ve1_1305/> It is significant that constant  reference is made to the differences in religion between Ārva and [[दास|Dāsa]] or [[दस्यु|Dasyu]].<ref name=fx11_ve1_1305/><br><br>Since the Dāsas were in many cases reduced to slavery, the word [[दास|Dāsa]] has the sense of ‘slave’ in several passages of the Rigveda.<ref name=fx12_ve1_1305/> Dāsī, the feminine, always has this sense from the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx13_ve1_1305/> onwards. Aboriginal women were, no doubt, the usual slaves, for on their husbands being slain in battle they would naturally have been taken as servants. They would sometimes also become concubines; thus '''[[कवष|Kavaṣa]]''' was taunted with being the son of a female slave (''dāsyāḥ putraḥ'') in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx14_ve1_1305/><br><br>Ludwig<ref name=fx15_ve1_1305/> considers that in some passages<ref name=fx16_ve1_1305/> [[दास|Dāsa]] is applied, in the sense of ‘enemy,’ to Āryan foes, but this is uncertain. Zimmer<ref name=fx17_ve1_1305/> and Meyer<ref name=fx18_ve1_1305/> think that [[दास|Dāsa]]<ref name=fx19_ve1_1305/> originally meant ‘enemy’ in general, later developing in Iran into the name of the Dahae<ref name=fx20_ve1_1305/> of the Caspian steppes, and in India into a designation of the aborigines. On the other hand, Hillebrandt<ref name=fx21_ve1_1305/> argues that, as the Dāsas and the Paṇis are mentioned together,<ref name=fx22_ve1_1305/> they must be deemed to be closely related tribes, identifying  the Paṇis with the Parnians and the Dāsas of the Rigveda with the Dahae. This view, of course, necessitates a transfer of the scenes of the Rigveda, where Dāsas are prominent, and especially those in which Divodāsa--‘the heavenly Dāsa’--plays an important part,<ref name=fx23_ve1_1305/> to the far west. Hillebrandt justifies this by regarding the scene of the sixth book of the Rigveda as quite different from that of the seventh and third, in which [[सुदास्|Sudās]], the Bharatas, [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]], and [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]] appear. The [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]] of the sixth book he locates in Arachosia, that of the seventh in the ‘Middle Country.’ It is, however, extremely doubtful whether this theory can be upheld. That Divodāsa should have been a [[दास|Dāsa]], and yet have fought against other Dāsas, is not in itself likely, especially when his son [[सुदास्|Sudās]] appears as a protagonist of Āryan civilization. It also seems unreasonable to seek in Arachosia for the river '''Sarasvati,''' which it is natural to locate in the ‘Middle Country.’<br><br>The wealth of the Dāsas was no doubt considerable,<ref name=fx24_ve1_1305/> but in civilization there is no reason to suppose that they were ever equal to the invaders.<ref name=fx25_ve1_1305/> Leading Dāsas were '''Ilībiśa, [[चुमुरि|Cumuri]]''' and '''[[धुनि|Dhuni]], [[पिप्रु|Pipru]], [[वर्चिन्|Varcin]], [[शम्बर|Śambara]].'''

The traditional rendering<ref name=fx6_ve1_1311/> is ‘husband of a woman married a second time’; Manu<ref name=fx7_ve1_1311/> seems to apply the term to the brother-in-law who is ‘married’ to his sister-in-law after his brother's death for the purpose of begetting a child, if he displays conjugal affection to her (''anurajyate kāmataḥ'').<ref name=fx8_ve1_1311/> This sense would be possible, since '''[[दिधिषु|Didhiṣu]]''' denotes a ‘wooer,’ and a widow could be regarded as a ‘wooer’ when able to control her own choice of a spouse. But another tradition<ref name=fx9_ve1_1311/> holds that Didhiṣū means the elder sister whose younger sister has married before her. This view is supported by a passage in the [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] [[धर्म|Dharma]] [[सूत्र|Sūtra]],<ref name=fx10_ve1_1311/> and by the use of the word ''agredidhiṣū-pati,''<ref name=fx11_ve1_1311/> which must mean the ‘husband of a younger sister married before the elder.’ In this case also Didhiṣū would mean ‘wooer,’ the elder sister being so called because, if her parents do not arrange a marriage for her, she is, according to Viṣṇu,<ref name=fx12_ve1_1311/> to make her own choice of a husband (''kuryāt svayaṃvaram'').

<u>'''Div,'''</u> ‘sky.’ The world as a whole is regarded as divided into the three domains of ‘earth,’ ‘air’ or ‘atmosphere,’ and ‘heaven’ or ‘sky’ (''div''),<ref name=fx1_ve1_1312/> or alternatively into ‘heaven and earth’ (''dyāvā-[[पृथिवी|pṛthivī]]''),<ref name=fx2_ve1_1312/> which two are then considered as comprising the universe, the atmosphere being included in the sky. Lightning, wind, and rain belong to the atmosphere, solar and  similar phenomena to the sky. In some passages<ref name=fx3_ve1_1312/> the vault (''[[नाक|nāka]]'') of the sky is added after the usual triad, and before the celestial light (''svar, jyotis'').<br><br>The threefold division of the universe is reflected in a threefold division of the three elements--earth, air, and sky. Thus a highest (''uttama,''<ref name=fx4_ve1_1312/> ''uttara,''<ref name=fx5_ve1_1312/> ''pārya''<ref name=fx6_ve1_1312/> ), a middle, and a lowest heaven are specified.<ref name=fx4_ve1_1312/> In the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx7_ve1_1312/> the three heavens are distinguished as ‘rich in water’ (''udanvatī''), as ''[[पीलुमती|pīlumatī]]'' (of uncertain meaning), and as the ''pradyaus,'' where the Fathers sit. Heaven is frequently called ''vyoman'' as well as ''rocana''<ref name=fx8_ve1_1312/> (properly the ‘luminous space’ of heaven), and the dividing firmament which separates the visible upper world from the highest heaven is called, besides ''[[नाक|nāka]],'' ‘vault,’ ''sānu,'' ‘summit,’ ''viṣṭap,'' ‘surface,’ and ''pṛṣṭha,'' ‘ridge,’ and even ‘ridge of the vault,’<ref name=fx9_ve1_1312/> or ‘summit of the vault.’<ref name=fx10_ve1_1312/><br><br>Similarly three atmospheres (''[[रजस्|rajas]]''), or oftener two, are alluded to,<ref name=fx11_ve1_1312/> but the division here is merely artificial. In one passage<ref name=fx12_ve1_1312/> six ''rajāṃsi,'' ‘regions,’ are referred to, the heavens and the earths no doubt being meant. The usual name for the atmosphere is ''antarikṣa.''<br><br>The three earths are equally artificial, the origin of the triad being probably the use of ''[[पृथिवी|pṛthivī]]'' in the plural<ref name=fx13_ve1_1312/> to denote the three divisions of the universe (just as ''pitarau,'' ‘two fathers,’ denotes ‘father and mother’).<ref name=fx14_ve1_1312/> The earth is called ''kṣam, kṣā, gmā,'' or designated by the epithets ''mahī,'' ‘the great,’ ''[[पृथिवी|pṛthivī]]'' or ''urvī,'' ‘the broad,’ ''uttānā,'' ‘the extended,’ and is regularly contrasted as ''idam,'' ‘this world here,’ with the upper sphere.<ref name=fx15_ve1_1312/>  The shape of the earth is compared with a wheel in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx16_ve1_1312/> and is expressly called ‘circular’ (''pari-maṇḍala'') in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx17_ve1_1312/> When earth is conjoined with heaven, the two are conceived as great bowls (''camvā'') turned towards each other.<ref name=fx18_ve1_1312/> In the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] Āraṇyaka<ref name=fx19_ve1_1312/> the two are regarded as halves of an egg.

The evidence,<ref name=fx24_ve1_1312/> however, for the latter assumption is quite insufficient.<ref name=fx25_ve1_1312/> The theory of the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx26_ve1_1312/> is that the sun merely reverses its bright side at night, turning its light on the stars and the moon while it retraverses its course to the east; and it has been shown<ref name=fx25_ve1_1312/> that this is probably the doctrine of the Rigveda also.<ref name=fx27_ve1_1312/> literature.

The drought being attributed by the Brahmins to his having superseded his elder brother, Śantanu offered the kingdom to Devāpi. The latter, however, refused, but acting as [[पुरोहित|Purohita]], or domestic priest, for his brother, obtained rain. The Bṛhaddevatā<ref name=fx3_ve1_1375/> tells much the same tale, but adds that the reason for Devāpi's exclusion from the throne was the fact that he suffered from a skin disease. The Epic and later legends further  develop the story, presenting two somewhat discrepant accounts. According to the one version,<ref name=fx4_ve1_1375/> the ground of Devāpi's being passed over was leprosy, while in the other his devoting himself to asceticism in his youth was the cause of his brother's taking his place.

On the other hand, the [[धर्म|Dharma]] Sūtras<ref name=fx3_ve1_1432/> contain full particulars.<br><br>(1) ''Criminal Law.''--The crimes recognized in Vedic literature vary greatly in importance, while there is no distinction adopted in principle between real crimes and what now are regarded as fanciful bodily defects or infringements of merely  conventional practices.<ref name=fx4_ve1_1432/> The crimes enumerated include the slaying of an embryo (''bhrūṇa''),<ref name=fx5_ve1_1432/> the slaying of a man (''[[वीर|vīra]]''),<ref name=fx6_ve1_1432/> and  the slaying of a Brahmin,<ref name=fx7_ve1_1432/> a much more serious crime. Treachery is mentioned in the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx8_ve1_1432/> as being punishable by death, as it was punished later.<ref name=fx9_ve1_1432/> But there is no trace of an organized criminal justice vested either in the king or in the people. There still seems to have prevailed the system of wergeld ('''[[वैर|Vaira]]'''), which indicates that criminal justice remained in the hands of those who were wronged. In the Sūtras,<ref name=fx10_ve1_1432/> on the other hand, the king's peace is recognized as infringed by crimes, a penalty being paid to him, or, according to the Brahminical textbooks, to the Brahmins. It may there-  fore reasonably be conjectured that the royal power of jurisdiction steadily increased; the references in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] to the king as wielding punishment ('''[[दण्ड|Daṇḍa]]''') confirm this supposition. Whether, as the analogy of other systems suggests, the king was assisted in his judicial duties, as he undoubtedly was later, by assessors, presumably of the Brahmin caste, cannot be made out clearly.<ref name=fx11_ve1_1432/><br><br>The procedure adopted in deciding cases is quite uncertain. In the Chāndogya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]]<ref name=fx12_ve1_1432/> the ordeal of the red-hot axe is mentioned as applied in an accusation of theft. It must apparently be understood to have been inflicted by the direction of the king. But no other judicial ordeal is known to Vedic literature (see '''[[दिव्य|Divya]]'''). The punishment of theft was in some cases at least death, probably when the thief was taken redhanded;<ref name=fx13_ve1_1432/> in other cases binding to posts was the penalty,<ref name=fx14_ve1_1432/> presumably accompanied by the return of the stolen goods. In the Chāndogya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]]<ref name=fx15_ve1_1432/> the list of sins given as apparently equal in wickedness is stealing gold, drinking spirits, defiling a Guru's bed, and the murder of a Brahmin.<br><br>(2) ''Civil Law.''--There is little recorded as to civil law in Vedic literature. The relations of the family and the question of family property are dealt with under '''[[उर्वरा|Urvarā]], [[क्षेत्र|Kṣetra]], Pati;''' succession and partition of property are treated under '''[[दाय|Dāya]].''' As regards the transfer of chattels--for land as transferable ''inter vivos'' is hardly yet recognized, save exceptionally as a sacrificial fee ('''[[दक्षिणा|Dakṣiṇā]]'''), and then disapproved<ref name=fx16_ve1_1432/> --the recognized modes are gift ('''[[दान|Dāna]]''') and barter or sale ('''[[क्रय|Kraya]]'''), which includes exchange. Original acquisition of land was no doubt brought  about by occupation and apportionment among the tribesmen,<ref name=fx17_ve1_1432/> while chattels were acquired by taking possession of them, provided that they were found on one's own land or on unoccupied land, and did not belong to any other person originally. The Sūtras<ref name=fx18_ve1_1432/> contain rules for the disposal of lost property, which tend to give it to the king, with the deduction of a percentage for the finder, unless the latter is a Brahmin, who keeps it all. As for contract, save in regard to moneylending (for which see '''[[ऋण|Ṛṇa]]'''), practically nothing is to be gathered from Vedic literature, doubtless because of the primitive conditions prevailing in that early period. Much of the labour, which would in a more developed society have been done by workers for hire, would be performed by slaves (''cf.'' '''[[दास|Dāsa]], [[शूद्र|Śūdra]]'''), while the technical workers of the village--of whom long lists are given in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<ref name=fx19_ve1_1432/> and the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx20_ve1_1432/> --may have been recompensed not by any sum based on each piece of work done, but by fixed allowances, much as the village servants are in modern times.<ref name=fx21_ve1_1432/> But this must remain a matter of conjecture, and it is uncertain what exact status the carpenter or smith held in the village. Similarly it is impossible to trace in the early literature any legal theory or practice as to torts, but rules as to penalties for insults appear in the Sūtras.<ref name=fx22_ve1_1432/><br><br>Very little is recorded as to procedure. The list<ref name=fx23_ve1_1432/> of victims at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ includes a ''praśnin,'' an ''[[अभि-प्रश्निन्|abhi-praśnin]],'' and a ''[[प्रश्न|praśna]]-vivāka,'' in whom it is not unreasonable to see the plaintiff, the defendant, and the arbitrator or judge: the terms may refer to what is probably an early  form of judicial procedure, a voluntary arbitration. The same idea may be conveyed by the word ''[[मध्यम-शी|madhyama-śī]],'' ‘lying in the midst,’ which occurs in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx24_ve1_1432/> and which Roth,<ref name=fx25_ve1_1432/> followed by Zimmer,<ref name=fx26_ve1_1432/> understood to mean an arbitrator or judge, the expression being derived from the judge acting with other judicial persons,<ref name=fx27_ve1_1432/> and being surrounded by the assembly of the people. But this interpretation is uncertain; Whitney<ref name=fx28_ve1_1432/> thinks that the word merely alludes to a chief round whom his men encamp. The king is later the chief civil judge, and may presumably have been so earlier, no doubt in conjunction with the elders of the tribe, but for this we are reduced to conjecture.<ref name=fx29_ve1_1432/><br><br>The use of witnesses as evidence is uncertain (see '''[[ज्ञातृ|Jñātṛ]]'''), and the ordeal is not recorded as deciding any civil matter except the dispute between '''[[वत्स|Vatsa]]''' and his rival as to the true Brahminical descent of the former, which was settled by his walking unharmed through the flame of a fire.<ref name=fx30_ve1_1432/> But it is probable on analogy that the ordeal may have been used for the purpose of deciding disputes. Whether the oath was so used cannot be certainly shown. It appears, however, that a Brahmin was preferred in legal matters to a non-Brahmin.<ref name=fx31_ve1_1432/><br><br>There are very few references to police officials: no doubt the king employed some of his dependents to execute sentences and arrest offenders (see '''Ugra, [[जीवगृभ्|Jīvagṛbh]]''').<br><br>(3) ''Morality.''--It is convenient to notice under this head  several points bearing on the moral condition of the people: (''a'') the exposure of children; (''b'') the exposure of the aged; (''c'') prostitution; (''d'') adultery; (''e'') incest.<br><br>(''a'') The exposure of girl infants is asserted by Zimmer<ref name=fx32_ve1_1432/> on the strength of a passage in the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx33_ve1_1432/> but it seems clear that the passage has been misunderstood,<ref name=fx34_ve1_1432/> and that it refers merely to laying the child aside, not exposing it, while a boy was lifted up. It is, however, true that the birth of a girl was not at all popular, not an unnatural sentiment in an early society, and paralleled among other Āryan peoples.<ref name=fx35_ve1_1432/><br><br>(''b'') The exposure of the aged is also inferred by Zimmer<ref name=fx36_ve1_1432/> from a passage of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx37_ve1_1432/> and from the mention of persons exposed (''ud-hitāḥ'') in the Atharvaveda.<ref name=fx38_ve1_1432/> The latter passage may well refer merely to the bodies being exposed after death to the elements (as is done by the Parsis). The former passage merely refers to the individual case of some person who may have been cast out, and proves absolutely nothing as to a habitual or recognized custom, nor can such a custom be inferred from, ''e.g.,'' the legend of '''Cyavāna.'''<br><br>(''c'') That prostitution existed in Rigvedic times is certain, but its extent is disputed. Brotherless girls were frequently reduced to becoming prostitutes;<ref name=fx39_ve1_1432/> the putting away of an illegitimate child is referred to in the Rigveda;<ref name=fx40_ve1_1432/> besides the  terms ''[[पुंश्चली|puṃścalī]]''<ref name=fx41_ve1_1432/> and ''[[महानग्नी|mahānagnī]],''<ref name=fx42_ve1_1432/> which undoubtedly mean ‘harlot,’ there are other clear references to prostitution;<ref name=fx43_ve1_1432/> and expressions like ''kumārī-[[पुत्र|putra]],'' ‘son of a maiden,’<ref name=fx44_ve1_1432/> and the ‘son of an unmarried girl’ (''agrū''), spoken of in the Rigveda<ref name=fx45_ve1_1432/> as exposed and attacked by animals, point in the same direction. The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<ref name=fx46_ve1_1432/> seems to recognize prostitution as a profession. Pischel<ref name=fx47_ve1_1432/> sees many references to Hetairai in the Rigveda, which as Geldner<ref name=fx48_ve1_1432/> insists reflects in its imagery the court life of Indian princes. But the correctness of the view of these two scholars on this point is not by any means certain.<ref name=fx49_ve1_1432/><br><br>(''d'') Adultery was generally regarded among Āryan peoples as a serious offence against the husband of the woman affected. We accordingly find in the legal literature of India traces of the rule that an adulterer can be slain with impunity if taken in the act.<ref name=fx50_ve1_1432/> Weber,<ref name=fx51_ve1_1432/> however, has adduced some material indicating an indifference to these matters in Vedic times, and Ludwig<ref name=fx52_ve1_1432/> has adopted the same view. But, as Delbrück<ref name=fx53_ve1_1432/> has clearly shown, the evidence is not convincing; the cited prescriptions<ref name=fx54_ve1_1432/> forbidding connexion with another man's wife during a certain rite do not imply that such connexion would otherwise be allowed: the ritual of the Varuṇa-praghāsas,<ref name=fx55_ve1_1432/> when a wife names her lover or lovers, seems originally to have been a solemn means of banishing the evil brought on a family by a wife's fall; '''Yājñavalkya's''' famous saying<ref name=fx56_ve1_1432/> that no one  cares whether a wife is ‘unchaste’ (''paraḥ-puṃsā'') or not is a mere mistranslation,<ref name=fx57_ve1_1432/> the expression ''paraḥ-puṃsā'' really meaning ‘removed from the male persons.’ And the uncertainty asserted in some passages<ref name=fx58_ve1_1432/> as to origin from a [[ऋषि|Ṛṣi]] is not a sign of doubtful descent, but is due to the fact that Ṛṣihood was a difficult matter to ascertain. None the less woman's position was lowered by the prevalence of polygamy, and such stories as that of Ahalyā and Indra<ref name=fx59_ve1_1432/> are not compatible with a very high standard of morality. A similar conclusion is pointed to by references in the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]]<ref name=fx60_ve1_1432/> to relations between the [[आर्य|Ārya]] man and the [[शूद्रा|Śūdrā]] woman, and by a spell given in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]]<ref name=fx61_ve1_1432/> to expiate relations with the wife of a [[श्रोत्रिय|Śrotriya]] (Brahmin theologian).<br><br>(''e'') Incest was recognized in the marriage of brother and sister as appears from the legend of Yama and Yamī in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx62_ve1_1432/> which clearly shows that such a marriage was not approved by the feeling of the Vedic age. There is also another hymn<ref name=fx63_ve1_1432/> in which reference to such intercourse appears to be made. Mention is further made in the Rigveda<ref name=fx64_ve1_1432/> to the wedlock of Prajāpati and his daughter, which is, however, interpreted mythologically in the Brāhmaṇas,<ref name=fx65_ve1_1432/> an interpretation which may be correct. That incest, however, actually did take place is clear from the Atharvaveda;<ref name=fx66_ve1_1432/> but even though the mythological interpretation of the passage were not justified, no conclusion could be drawn from the hymn as to the normal occurrence of such relations.<br>

These two, being kings, could not<ref name=fx2_ve1_1469/> properly accept gifts which Brāhmaṇas alone could accept, but by becoming authors of a verse of the Rigveda<ref name=fx3_ve1_1469/> they qualified themselves to accept them. The verse mentions the names in the dual as ''Dhvasrayoḥ Puruṣantyoḥ,'' ‘from the two, [[ध्वस्र|Dhvasra]] and [[पुरुषन्ति|Puruṣanti]].’<ref name=fx4_ve1_1469/> In the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx5_ve1_1469/> the names occur in the dual as ''Dhvasre Puruṣantī,'' a reading which is confirmed by the [[निदान|Nidāna]] [[सूत्र|Sūtra]].<ref name=fx6_ve1_1469/> The former is necessarily a feminine form, though Sāyaṇa, in his comment on the passage, explains it as really an irregular masculine. According to Roth,<ref name=fx7_ve1_1469/> the feminine is a corruption based on the dual form in the verse of the Rigveda mentioned above; but the names may be those of women,<ref name=fx8_ve1_1469/> as Benfey<ref name=fx9_ve1_1469/>  inclines to believe. Weber<ref name=fx10_ve1_1469/> suggests that the two were demons, but this is, as Sieg<ref name=fx11_ve1_1469/> shows, quite unnecessary.

नक्षत्र|nakṣatra|nakShatra|నక్షత్ర|ನಕ್ಷತ್ರ|naxatra|_vei1@1474|_vei1_pn409
<u>'''Nakṣatra'''</u> is a word of obscure origin and derivation. The Indian interpreters already show a great divergence of opinion as to its primary meaning. The Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx1_ve1_1474/> resolves it into ''na-[[क्षत्र|kṣatra]]'' (‘no power’), explaining it by a legend. The [[निरुक्त|Nirukta]]<ref name=fx2_ve1_1474/> refers it to the root ''nakṣ,'' ‘obtain,’ following the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx3_ve1_1474/> Aufrecht<ref name=fx4_ve1_1474/> and Weber<ref name=fx5_ve1_1474/> derived it from ''[[नक्त|nakta]]-tra,'' ‘guardian of night,’ and more recently<ref name=fx6_ve1_1474/> the derivation from ''nak-[[क्षत्र|kṣatra]],'' ‘having rule over night,’ seems to be gaining acceptance. The generic meaning of the word therefore seems to be ‘star.’<br><br>''The Nakṣatras as Stars in the Rigveda and Later.''--The sense of ‘star’ appears to be adequate for all or nearly all the passages in which [[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]] occurs in the Rigveda.<ref name=fx7_ve1_1474/> The same sense occurs in the later Saṃhitās also: the sun and the Nakṣatras are mentioned together,<ref name=fx8_ve1_1474/> or the sun, the moon, and the Nakṣatras,<ref name=fx9_ve1_1474/> or the moon and the Nakṣatras,<ref name=fx10_ve1_1474/> or the Nakṣatras alone;<ref name=fx11_ve1_1474/>  but there is no necessity to attribute to the word the sense of ‘lunar mansion’ in these passages.<br><br>On the other hand, the names of at least three of the Nakṣatras in the later sense occur in the Rigveda. [[तिष्य|Tiṣya]],<ref name=fx12_ve1_1474/> however, does not seem to be mentioned as a lunar mansion. With '''Aghās''' (plur.) and '''[[अर्जुनी|Arjunī]]''' (dual)<ref name=fx13_ve1_1474/> the case is different: it seems probable that they are the later lunar mansions called [[मघास्|Maghās]] (plur.) and [[फल्गुनी|Phalgunī]] (dual). The names appear to have been deliberately changed in the Rigveda, and it must be remembered that the hymn in which they occur, the wedding hymn of Sūryā, has no claim to great age.<ref name=fx14_ve1_1474/> Ludwig<ref name=fx15_ve1_1474/> and Zimmer<ref name=fx16_ve1_1474/> have seen other references to the Nakṣatras as 27 in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx17_ve1_1474/> but these seem most improbable. Nor do the adjectives ''[[रेवती|revatī]]'' (‘rich’) and ''punarvasā'' (‘bringing wealth again’) in another hymn<ref name=fx18_ve1_1474/> appear to refer to the Nakṣatras.<br><br>''The Nakṣatras as Lunar Mansions.''--In several passages of the later Saṃhitās the connexion of the moon and the Nakṣatras is conceived of as a marriage union. Thus in the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]]<ref name=fx19_ve1_1474/> and [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitās<ref name=fx20_ve1_1474/> it is expressly stated that Soma was wedded to the mansions, but dwelt only with [[रोहिणी|Rohiṇī]]; the others being angry, he had ultimately to undertake to live with them all equally. Weber<ref name=fx21_ve1_1474/> hence deduced that the Nakṣatras were regarded as of equal extent, but this is to press the texts unduly, except in the sense of approximate equality. The number of the mansions is not stated as 27 in the story told in the two Saṃhitās: the Taittīriya has 33, and the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] no  number; but 27 appears as their number in the list which is found in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx22_ve1_1474/> and elsewhere.<ref name=fx23_ve1_1474/> The number 28 is much less well attested: in one passage of the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx24_ve1_1474/> [[अभिजित्|Abhijit]] is practically marked as a new comer, though in a later book,<ref name=fx25_ve1_1474/> in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx26_ve1_1474/> and in the Atharvaveda list,<ref name=fx27_ve1_1474/> it has found acceptance. It is perfectly possible that 28 is the earlier number, and that [[अभिजित्|Abhijit]] dropped out because it was faint, or too far north, or because 27 was a more mystic (3×3×3) number: it is significant that the Chinese Sieou and the Arabic Manāzil are 28 in number.<ref name=fx28_ve1_1474/> Weber,<ref name=fx29_ve1_1474/> however, believes that 27 is the older number in India.<br><br>The meaning of the number is easily explained when it is remembered that a periodic month occupies something between 27 and 28 days, more nearly the former number. Such a month is in fact recognized in the Lāṭyāyana<ref name=fx30_ve1_1474/> and [[निदान|Nidāna]] Sūtras<ref name=fx31_ve1_1474/> as consisting of 27 days, 12 months making a year of 324 days, a [[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]] year, or with an intercalary month, a year of 351 days. The [[निदान|Nidāna]] [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx32_ve1_1474/> makes an attempt to introduce the [[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]] reckoning into the civil or solar (''sāvana'') year of 360 days, for it holds that the sun spends 13(1/3) days in each [[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]] (13(1/3)×27 = 360). But the month of 27 or 28 days plays no part in the chronological calculations of the Veda.<ref name=fx33_ve1_1474/><br><br>''The Names of the Nakṣatras.''--In addition to the two mentioned in the Rigveda, the earlier Atharvaveda<ref name=fx34_ve1_1474/> gives the  names of [[ज्येष्ठघ्नी|Jyeṣṭhaghnī]]<ref name=fx35_ve1_1474/> (the later [[ज्येष्ठा|Jyeṣṭhā]]) and [[विचृतौ|Vicṛtau]],<ref name=fx36_ve1_1474/> which are mentioned as in close connexion, and of Revatīs (plural) and [[कृत्तिकास्|Kṛttikās]].<ref name=fx37_ve1_1474/> With reference to possible times for the ceremony of the Agnyādhāna, or ‘laying of the sacred fires,’ the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx38_ve1_1474/> the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx39_ve1_1474/> and the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx40_ve1_1474/> mention the Nakṣatras called [[कृत्तिकास्|Kṛttikās]], [[रोहिणी|Rohiṇī]], Phalgunyas, [[हस्त|Hasta]]; the latter [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] adds [[पुनर्वसू|Punarvasū]], and in an additional remark<ref name=fx41_ve1_1474/> excludes Pūrve [[फल्गुनी|Phalgunī]] in favour of Uttare [[फल्गुनी|Phalgunī]]. The Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx42_ve1_1474/> adds [[मृगशीर्ष|Mṛgaśīrṣa]] and [[चित्रा|Citrā]] as possibilities. On the other hand, [[पुनर्वसू|Punarvasū]] is recommended by all authorities<ref name=fx43_ve1_1474/> as suitable for the Punarādheya, ‘relaying of the sacred fires,’ which takes place if the first fire has failed to effect the aim of its existence, the prosperity of the sacrificer.<ref name=fx44_ve1_1474/> The [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx45_ve1_1474/> however, allows Anurādhās also.<br><br>In the ceremony of the Agnicayana, or ‘piling of the firealtar,’ the bricks are assumed to be equal in number to the Nakṣatras. The bricks number 756, and they are equated to 27 Nakṣatras multiplied by 27 secondary Nakṣatras, reckoned as 720 (instead of 729), with the addition of 36 days, the length of an intercalary month. Nothing can be usefully derived from this piece of priestly nonsense.<ref name=fx46_ve1_1474/> But in connexion with this ceremony the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]] Saṃhitās<ref name=fx47_ve1_1474/> enumerate the 27  Nakṣatras, and these lists<ref name=fx48_ve1_1474/> may be given ''in extenso'' as follows:<C1>''[[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā.'' <C2>''Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhita.'' <C3>''[[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā.''<C1>1.

In a later book,<ref name=fx50_ve1_1474/> however, the list grows to 28,  and the full moon is inserted after number 14, and the new moon after number 28, as an attempt to bring the Nākṣatra (lunar) month into accordance with the Sāvana (solar) month of 30 days.

The seven stars of the [[कृत्तिकास्|Kṛttikās]] are named as Ambā, [[दुला|Dulā]], [[नितत्नी|Nitatnī]], Abhrayantī, Meghayantī, Varṣayantī, Cupuṇīkā, names found also in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]]<ref name=fx51_ve1_1474/> and [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitās.<ref name=fx52_ve1_1474/> Beside [[मृगशीर्ष|Mṛgaśīrṣa]], Invakās are also mentioned.<ref name=fx53_ve1_1474/> Then come [[आर्द्रा|Ārdrā]], [[पुनर्वसू|Punarvasū]], [[तिष्य|Tiṣya]], [[आश्रेषास्|Āśreṣās]], [[मघास्|Maghās]] (beside which Anaghās, Agadās, and Arundhatīs are also mentioned), Phalgunyas (but elsewhere in the dual, Phalgunyau),<ref name=fx54_ve1_1474/> Phalgunyas, [[हस्त|Hasta]], [[चित्रा|Citrā]], Niṣṭyā, [[विशाखे|Viśākhe]], [[अनूराधास्|Anūrādhās]], [[ज्येष्ठा|Jyeṣṭhā]], [[मूल|Mūla]], Aṣāḍhās, Aṣāḍhās, [[अभिजित्|Abhijit]], Śronā, [[श्रविष्ठास्|Śraviṣṭhās]], [[शतभिषज्|Śatabhiṣaj]], Proṣṭhapadās, Proṣṭhapadās, [[रेवती|Revatī]], [[अश्वयुजौ|Aśvayujau]], Bharaṇyas, but also [[अपभरणीस्|Apabharaṇīs]].<ref name=fx55_ve1_1474/> [[अभिजित्|Abhijit]], which occurs also in an earlier part of the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx56_ve1_1474/> is perhaps interpolated.

This division corresponds with one in the third book of the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx60_ve1_1474/> where the days of the light half of the month and those of the dark half are equated with the Nakṣatras. The [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] treats the former series as south, the latter as north; but this has no relation to facts, and can only be regarded as a ritual absurdity.<br><br>The late nineteenth book of the Atharvaveda contains a list<ref name=fx61_ve1_1474/> of the Nakṣatras, including [[अभिजित्|Abhijit]].

<u>'''2. Rohiṇī,'''</u> ‘ruddy,’ is the name of the conspicuously reddish star, ''a'' Tauri or Aldebaran, and denotes the group of the Hyades,  Tauri. Its identification seems absolutely assured by the legend of Prajāpati in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx69_ve1_1476/> He is there represented as pursuing his daughter with incestuous intention, and as having been shot with an arrow ('''[[इषु त्रिकाण्डा|Iṣu Trikāṇḍā]],''' ‘the belt of Orion’) by the ‘huntsman’ ('''[[मृगव्याध|Mṛgavyādha]],''' ‘Sirius’).

The [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx84_ve1_1485/> however, constructs an asterismal Prajāpati, giving him [[चित्रा|Citrā]] (''a'' Virginis) for head, [[हस्त|Hasta]] (Corvus) for hand, the [[विशाखे|Viśākhe]] (''a'' and  Libræ) for thighs, and the Anurādhās (, and  Scorpionis) for standing place, with Niṣṭyā for heart. But Arcturus, being 30º out, spoils this figure, while, on the other hand, the Arabic and Chinese systems have respectively, instead of Arcturus, , and  Virginis and  Virginis, which would well fit into the Prajāpati figure. But in spite of the force of this argument of Weber's,<ref name=fx85_ve1_1485/> Whitney<ref name=fx86_ve1_1485/> is not certain that Niṣṭyā here must mean a star in Virgo, pointing out that the name Niṣṭyā, ‘outcast,’ suggests the separation of this [[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]] from the others in question.<br>

This mansion is later called Rādhā according to the Amarakośa, and it is curious that in the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx87_ve1_1486/> the expression ''rādho [[विशाखे|Viśākhe]],'' ‘the [[विशाखे|Viśākhe]] are prosperity,’ should occur. But probably Rādhā is merely an invention due to the name of the next [[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]], [[अनुराधा|Anurādhā]], wrongly conceived as meaning ‘that which is after or follows Rādhā.’<ref name=fx88_ve1_1486/><br>

<u>'''20. Abhijit'''</u> is the brilliant star  Lyræ with its two companions  and . Its location in 60º north latitude is completely discordant with the position of the corresponding Arabian and Chinese asterisms. This fact is considered by Oldenberg<ref name=fx90_ve1_1490/> to support the view that it was a later addition to the system; its occurrence, however, as early as the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx91_ve1_1490/> which he does not note, somewhat invalidates<ref name=fx92_ve1_1490/> that view. In the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx93_ve1_1490/> [[अभिजित्|Abhijit]] is said to be ‘over Aṣāḍhās, under [[श्रोणा|Śroṇā]],’ which Weber<ref name=fx94_ve1_1490/> held to refer to its position in space, inferring thence that its Vedic position corresponded to that of the Arab Manāzil and the Chinese Sieou--viz., , Capricorni. But Whitney<ref name=fx95_ve1_1490/> argues effectively that the words ‘over’ and ‘under’ really refer to the place of [[अभिजित्|Abhijit]] in the list, ‘after’ Aṣāḍhās and ‘before’ [[श्रोणा|Śroṇā]].<br>

Weber<ref name=fx96_ve1_1491/> very need-  lessly thinks that the name [[श्रवण|Śravaṇa]] suggested two ears and the head between.

This is done in two ways. The name, if not already a feminine, may be turned into a feminine and compounded with ''[[पूर्ण-मास|pūrṇa-māsa]],'' ‘the full moon,’ as in ''Tiṣyā-[[पूर्णमास|pūrṇamāsa]],'' ‘the full moon in the [[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]] [[तिष्य|Tiṣya]].’<ref name=fx103_ve1_1496/> Much more often, however, it is turned into a derivative adjective, used with ''[[पौर्णमासी|paurṇamāsī]],'' ‘the full  moon (night),’ or with ''amāvāsyā,'' ‘the new moon (night),’ as in ''Phālgunī [[पौर्णमासी|paurṇamāsī]],'' ‘the full-moon night in the [[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]] Phalgunī’;<ref name=fx104_ve1_1496/> or, as is usual in the Sūtras, the [[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]] adjective alone is used to denote the full-moon night. The month itself is called by a name derived<ref name=fx105_ve1_1496/> from that of a [[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]], but only Phālguna,<ref name=fx106_ve1_1496/> [[चैत्र|Caitra]],<ref name=fx107_ve1_1496/> Vaiśākha,<ref name=fx108_ve1_1496/> Taiṣya,<ref name=fx109_ve1_1496/> Māgha<ref name=fx110_ve1_1496/> occur in the Brāhmaṇas, the complete list later being Phālguna, [[चैत्र|Caitra]], Vaiśākha, Jyaiṣṭha, Āṣāḍha, Śrāvaṇa, Prauṣṭhapada, Āśvayuja, Kārttika, Mārgaśīrṣa, Taiṣya, Māgha. Strictly speaking, these should be lunar months, but the use of a lunar year was clearly very restricted: we have seen that as early as the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] there was a tendency to equate lunar months with the twelve months of thirty days which made up the solar year (see '''[[मास|Māsa]]''').<br><br>''The Nakṣatras and Chronology.''--(1) An endeavour has been made to ascertain from the names of the months the period at which the systematic employment of those names was introduced. Sir William Jones<ref name=fx111_ve1_1496/> refers to this possibility, and Bentley, by the gratuitous assumption that Śrāvaṇa always marked the summer solstice, concluded that the names of the months did not date before B.C. 1181. Weber<ref name=fx112_ve1_1496/> considered that there was a possibility of fixing a date by this means, but Whitney<ref name=fx113_ve1_1496/> has convincingly shown that it is an impossible feat, and Thibaut<ref name=fx114_ve1_1496/> concurs in this view. Twelve became fixed as the number of the months because of the desire, evident in the Brāhmaṇas, somehow or other to harmonize lunar with solar time; but the selection of twelve Nakṣatras out of twenty-seven as connected with the night of full moon can have no chronological significance, because full moon at  no period occurred in those twelve only, but has at all periods occurred in every one of the twenty-seven at regularly recurrent intervals.<br><br>(2) All the lists of the Nakṣatras begin with Kṛttīkās. It is only fair to suppose that there was some special reason for this fact. Now the later list of the Nakṣatras begins with [[अश्विनी|Aśvinī]], and it was unquestionably rearranged because at the time of its adoption the vernal equinox coincided with the star  Piscium on the border of [[रेवती|Revatī]] and [[अश्विनी|Aśvinī]],<ref name=fx115_ve1_1496/> say in the course of the sixth century A.D. Weber<ref name=fx116_ve1_1496/> has therefore accepted the view that the [[कृत्तिकास्|Kṛttikās]] were chosen for a similar reason, and the date at which that [[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]] coincided with the vernal equinox has been estimated at some period in the third millennium B.C.<ref name=fx117_ve1_1496/> A very grave objection to this view is its assumption that the sun, and not the moon, was then regarded as connected with the Nakṣatras; and both Thibaut<ref name=fx118_ve1_1496/> and Oldenberg<ref name=fx119_ve1_1496/> have pronounced decidedly against the idea of connecting the equinox with the [[कृत्तिकास्|Kṛttikās]]. Jacobi<ref name=fx120_ve1_1496/> has contended that in the Rigveda<ref name=fx121_ve1_1496/> the commencement of the rains and the summer solstice mark the beginning of the new year and the end of the old, and that further the new year began with the summer solstice in [[फल्गुनी|Phalgunī]].<ref name=fx121_ve1_1496/> He has also referred to the distinction of the two sets of Deva and Yama Nakṣatras in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx122_ve1_1496/> as supporting his view of the connexion of the sun and the Nakṣatras. But this view is far from satisfactory: the Rigveda passages cannot yield the sense required except by translating the word ''[[द्वादश|dvādaśa]]''<ref name=fx123_ve1_1496/> as ‘the twelfth (month)’ instead of ‘consisting of twelve parts,’ that is, ‘year,’ the accepted  interpretation; and the division of the Nakṣatras is not at all satisfactorily explained by a supposed connexion with the sun. It may further be mentioned that even if the [[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]] of [[कृत्तिकास्|Kṛttikās]] be deemed to have been chosen because of its coincidence with the vernal equinox, both Whitney<ref name=fx124_ve1_1496/> and Thibaut<ref name=fx125_ve1_1496/> are prepared to regard it as no more than a careless variant of the date given by the [[ज्योतिष|Jyotiṣa]], which puts the winter solstice in Māgha.<br><br>(3) The winter solstice in Māgha is assured by a [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] text, for the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx126_ve1_1496/> expressly places it in the new moon of Māgha (''māghasyāmāvāsyāyām''). It is not very important whether we take this with the commentators<ref name=fx127_ve1_1496/> as the new moon in the middle of a month commencing with the day after full moon in Taiṣa, or, which is much more likely, as the new moon beginning the month and preceding full moon in Māgha. The datum gives a certain possibility of fixing an epoch in the following way. If the end of [[रेवती|Revatī]] marked the vernal equinox at one period, then the precession of the equinoxes would enable us to calculate at what point of time the vernal equinox was in a position corresponding to the winter solstice in Māgha, when the solstitial colure cut the ecliptic at the beginning of [[श्रविष्ठास्|Śraviṣṭhās]]. This would be, on the strict theory, in the third quarter of Bharaṇī, 6(3/4) asterisms removed from [[श्रविष्ठास्|Śraviṣṭhās]], and the difference between that and the beginning of [[अश्विनी|Aśvinī]]=  1(3/4) asterisms = 23(1/3)º (27 asterisms being = 360º). Taking the starting-point at 499 A.D., the assured period of [[वराह|Varāha]] Mihira, Jones<ref name=fx128_ve1_1496/> arrived at the date B. C. 1181 for the vernal equinox corresponding to the winter solstice in Māgha--that is, on the basis of 1º = 72 years as the precession. Pratt<ref name=fx129_ve1_1496/> arrived at precisely the same date, taking the same rate of precession and adopting as his basis the ascertained position in the Siddhāntas of the junction star<ref name=fx130_ve1_1496/> of [[मघा|Maghā]],  Leonis or Regulus. Davis<ref name=fx131_ve1_1496/> and Colebrooke<ref name=fx132_ve1_1496/> arrived at a different date, B.C. 1391, by taking as the basis of their calculation the junction star of [[चित्रा|Citrā]], which happens to be of uncertain position, varying as much as 3º in the different textbooks. But though the twelfth century has received a certain currency as the epoch of the observation in the [[ज्योतिष|Jyotiṣa]],<ref name=fx133_ve1_1496/> it is of very doubtful value. As Whitney points out, it is impossible to say that the earlier asterisms coincided in position with the later asterisms of 13(1/3)º extent each. They were not chosen as equal divisions, but as groups of stars which stood in conjunction with the moon; and the result of subsequently making them strictly equal divisions was to throw the principal stars of the later groups altogether out of their asterisms.<ref name=fx134_ve1_1496/> Nor can we say that the star  Piscium early formed the eastern boundary of [[रेवती|Revatī]]; it may possibly not even have been in that asterism at all, for it is far remote from the Chinese and Arabic asterisms corresponding to [[रेवती|Revatī]]. Added to all this, and to the uncertainty of the starting-point-582 A.D., 560 A.D., or 491 A.D. being variants<ref name=fx135_ve1_1496/> --is the fact that the place of the equinox is not a matter accurately determinable by mere observation, and that the Hindu astronomers of the Vedic period cannot be deemed to have been very accurate observers, since they made no precise determination of the  number of days of the year, which even in the [[ज्योतिष|Jyotiṣa]] they do not determine more precisely than as 366 days, and even the [[सूर्य|Sūrya]] Siddhānta<ref name=fx136_ve1_1496/> does not know the precession of the equinoxes. It is therefore only fair to allow a thousand years for possible errors,<ref name=fx137_ve1_1496/> and the only probable conclusion to be drawn from the datum of the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] is that it was recording an observation which must have been made some centuries B.C., in itself a result quite in harmony with the probable date of the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] literature,<ref name=fx138_ve1_1496/> say B.C. 800-600.<br><br>(4) Another chronological argument has been derived from the fact that there is a considerable amount of evidence for Phālguna having been regarded as the beginning of the year, since the full moon in [[फल्गुनी|Phalgunī]] is often described as the ‘mouth (''mukham'') of the year.’<ref name=fx139_ve1_1496/> Jacobi<ref name=fx140_ve1_1496/> considers that this  was due to the fact that the year was reckoned from the winter solstice, which would coincide with the month of Phālguna about B.C. 4000. Oldenberg<ref name=fx141_ve1_1496/> and Thibaut,<ref name=fx142_ve1_1496/> on the other hand, maintain that the choice of Phālguna as the ‘mouth’ of the year was due to its being the first month of spring. This view is favoured by the fact that there is distinct evidence<ref name=fx143_ve1_1496/> of the correspondence of Phālguna and the beginning of spring: as we have seen above in the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], the new moon in Māgha is placed at the winter solstice,<ref name=fx144_ve1_1496/> which puts the full moon of [[फल्गुनी|Phalgunī]] at a month and a half after the winter solstice, or in the first week of February, a date not in itself improbable for about B.C. 800, and corresponding with the February 7 of the ''veris initium'' in the Roman Calendar. This fact accords with the only natural division of the year into three periods of four months, as the rainy season lasts from June 7-10 to October 7-10, and it is certain that the second set of four months dates from the beginning of the rains (see '''[[चातुर्मास्य|Cāturmāsya]]'''). Tilak,<ref name=fx145_ve1_1496/> on the other hand, holds that the winter solstice coincided with Māghī full moon at the time of the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā (B.C. 2350), and had coincided with Phālgunī and Caitrī in early periods--viz., B.C. 4000-2500, and B.C. 60004000.<br><br>(5) The passages of the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx146_ve1_1496/> and the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx147_ve1_1496/> which treat the full moon in Phālguna as the beginning of the year, give as an alternative the full moon in [[चैत्र|Caitra]]. Probably the latter month was chosen so as to secure that the initial day should fall well within the season of spring,<ref name=fx148_ve1_1496/> and was not, as Jacobi believes, a relic of a period  when the winter solstice corresponded with [[चैत्र|Caitra]]. Another alternative is the [[एकाष्टका|Ekāṣṭakā]], interpreted by the commentators as the eighth day after the full moon in [[मघास्|Maghās]], a time which might, as being the last quarter of the waning half of the old year, well be considered as representing the end of the year. A fourth alternative is the fourth day before full moon; the full moon meant must be that of [[चैत्र|Caitra]], as Ālekhana quoted by Āpastamba held, not of Māgha, as Āśmarathya, Laugākṣi and the Mīmāṃsists believed, and as Tilak believes.<ref name=fx149_ve1_1496/><br><br>(6) Others, again, according to the [[गृह्य|Gṛhya]] ritual, began the year with the month Mārgaśīrṣa, as is shown by its other name Āgrahāyaṇa<ref name=fx150_ve1_1496/> (‘belonging to the commencement of the year’). Jacobi and Tilak<ref name=fx151_ve1_1496/> think that this one denoted the autumn equinox in [[मृगशिरस्|Mṛgaśiras]], corresponding to the winter solstice in [[फल्गुनी|Phalgunī]]. But, as Thibaut<ref name=fx152_ve1_1496/> shows clearly, it was selected as the beginning of a year that was taken to commence with autumn, just as some took the spring to commence with [[चैत्र|Caitra]] instead of Phālguna.<ref name=fx153_ve1_1496/><br><br>(7) Jacobi has also argued, with the support of Bühler,<ref name=fx154_ve1_1496/> from the terms given for the beginning of Vedic study in the [[गृह्य|Gṛhya]] Sūtras, on the principle that study commenced with the rains (as in the Buddhist ''vassā'') which mark the summer solstice. He concludes that if Bhādrapada appears as the date of commencing study in some texts, it was fixed thus because at one time Proṣṭhapadās (the early name of Bhadrapadās) coincided with the summer solstice, this having been the case when the winter solstice was in Phālguna. But Whitney<ref name=fx155_ve1_1496/> has pointed out that this argument is utterly illegitimate; we cannot say that there was any necessary connexion between the rains and learning--a month like Śrāvaṇa might be preferred  because of its connexion with the word [[श्रवण|Śravaṇa]], ‘ear’--and in view of the precession of the equinoxes, we must assume that Bhādrapada was kept because of its traditional coincidence with the beginning of the rains after it had ceased actually so to coincide.<ref name=fx156_ve1_1496/><br><br>''The Origin of the Nakṣatras.''--As we have seen, there is no evidence showing the process by which the Nakṣatras may  have originated in India. They are mentioned only as stars in the earlier parts of the Rigveda, then the names of three of them are found in the latest parts of that Saṃhitā, and finally in the later Atharvaveda and in the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]] Saṃhitās the full list appears. It may also be noted that the Vedic Indians show (see '''[[ग्रह|Graha]]''') a remarkably small knowledge of the other astronomical phenomena; the discovery of a series of 27 lunar mansions by them would therefore be rather surprising. On the other hand, the nature of such an operation is not very complicated; it consists merely in selecting a star or a star group with which the moon is in conjunction. It is thus impossible ''a priori'' to deny that the Vedic Indians could have invented for themselves a lunar Zodiac.<ref name=fx157_ve1_1496/><br><br>But the question is complicated by the fact that there exist two similar sets of 28 stars or star groups in Arabia and in China, the Manāzil and the Sieou. The use of the Manāzil in Arabia is consistent and effective; the calendar is regulated by them, and the position of the asterisms corresponds best with the positions required for a lunar Zodiac. The Indians might therefore have borrowed the system from Arabia, but that is a mere possibility, because the evidence for the existence of the Manāzil is long posterior to that for the existence of the Nakṣatras, while again the Mazzaroth or Mazzaloth of the Old Testament<ref name=fx158_ve1_1496/> may really be the lunar mansions.<ref name=fx159_ve1_1496/> That the Arabian system is borrowed from India, as Burgess<ref name=fx160_ve1_1496/> held, is, on the other hand, not at all probable.<br><br>Biot, the eminent Chinese scholar, in a series of papers published by him between 1839 and 1861,<ref name=fx161_ve1_1496/> attempted to prove  the derivation of the [[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]] from the Chinese Sieou. The latter he did not regard as being in origin lunar mansions at all. He thought that they were equatorial stars used, as in modern astronomy, as a standard to which planets or other stars observed in the neighbourhood can be eferred; they were, as regards twenty-four of them, selecte about B.C. 2357 on account of their proximity to the equator, and of their having the same right ascension as certain circumpolar stars which had attracted the attention of Chinese observers. Four more were added in B.C. 1100 in order to mark the equinoxes and solstices of the period. He held that the list of stars commenced with Mao (= [[कृत्तिकास्|Kṛttikās]]), which was at the vernal equinox in B.C. 2357. Weber,<ref name=fx162_ve1_1496/> in an elaborate essay of 1860, disputed this theory, and endeavoured to show that the Chinese literary evidence for the Sieou was late, dating not even from before the third century B.C. The last point does not appear<ref name=fx163_ve1_1496/> to be correct, but his objections against the basis of Biot's theory were reinforced by Whitney,<ref name=fx164_ve1_1496/> who insisted that Biot's supposition of the Sieou's not having been ultimately derived from a system of lunar mansions, was untenable. This is admitted by the latest defender of the hypothesis of borrowing from China, Léopold de Saussure,<ref name=fx165_ve1_1496/> , but his arguments in favour of a Chinese origin for the Indian lunar mansions have been refuted by Oldenberg,<ref name=fx166_ve1_1496/> who has also pointed out<ref name=fx167_ve1_1496/> that the series does not begin with Mao (= [[कृत्तिकास्|Kṛttikās]]).<br><br>There remains only the possibility that a common source for all the three sets--[[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]], Manāzil, and Sieou--may be found in Babylonia. Hommel<ref name=fx168_ve1_1496/> has endeavoured to show that recent research has established in Babylonia the existence of a lunar zodiac of twenty-four members headed by the  Pleiades (= [[कृत्तिकास्|Kṛttikās]]); but Thibaut's researches<ref name=fx169_ve1_1496/> are not favourable to this claim. On the other hand, Weber,<ref name=fx170_ve1_1496/> Whitney,<ref name=fx171_ve1_1496/> Zimmer,<ref name=fx172_ve1_1496/> and Oldenberg<ref name=fx173_ve1_1496/> all incline to the view that in Babylonia is to be found the origin of the system, and this must for the present be regarded as the most probable view, for there are other traces of Babylonian influence in Vedic literature, such as the legend of the flood, perhaps the Ādityas,<ref name=fx174_ve1_1496/> and possibly the word '''[[मना|Manā]].''' <br>

<u>'''Ni-ṣāda'''</u> is found in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.<ref name=fx1_ve1_1590/> The word seems to denote not so much a particular tribe, but to be the general term for the non-Āryan tribes who were not under Āryan control, as the Śūdras were, for [[औपमन्यव|Aupamanyava]]<ref name=fx2_ve1_1590/> took the five peoples (''pañca janāḥ'') to be the four castes (''catvāro  varṇāḥ'') and the Niṣādas, and the commentator Mahīdhara explains the word where it occurs in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<ref name=fx3_ve1_1590/> as meaning a Bhilla, or Bhīl. A village of Niṣādas is mentioned in the Lāṭyāyana Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]],<ref name=fx4_ve1_1590/> and a [[निषाद|Niṣāda]] '''[[स्थपति|Sthapati]],''' a leader of some kind, is referred to in the Kātyāyana Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx5_ve1_1590/> and in a [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] cited by the scholiast on that passage. Weber<ref name=fx6_ve1_1590/> thinks that the Niṣādas were the settled aborigines (form ''ni,'' ‘down,’ and ''sad,'' ‘settle’), a view supported by the fact that the ritual of the Viśvajit sacrifice<ref name=fx7_ve1_1590/> requires a temporary residence with Niṣādas; for the Niṣādas who would permit an Āryan to reside temporarily amongst them must have been partially amenable to Āryan influence. But the name might easily be applied to the whole body of aborigines outside the Āryan organization. Von Schroeder<ref name=fx8_ve1_1590/> thinks that the Niṣādas were most probably identical with the Nysæans, who, according to the Greek account, sent an embassy to Alexander when he was in the territory of the Aśvakas, but this identification is doubtful.<br>

<u>'''Nau'''</u> is the regular word in the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_1627/> and later<ref name=fx2_ve1_1627/> for a ‘boat’ or ‘ship.’ In the great majority of cases the ship was merely a boat for crossing rivers, though no doubt a large boat was needed for crossing many of the broad rivers of the Panjab as well as the '''[[यमुना|Yamunā]]''' and '''[[गङ्गा|Gaṅgā]].''' Often no doubt the Nau was a mere dug-out canoe (''[[दारु|dāru]]'').<ref name=fx3_ve1_1627/> It is certainly against the theory<ref name=fx4_ve1_1627/> of the existence in Vedic times of an extensive sea trade that there is no mention of any of the parts of a ship, such as masts and sails, except the oar ('''[[अरित्र|Aritra]]'''), Yet there are some allusions indicating a trade more extensive than that implied by boats used for crossing rivers. The Atharvaveda<ref name=fx5_ve1_1627/> compares the ruin of a kingdom where Brahmins are oppressed to the  sinking of a ship which is leaking (''bhinnā''); though the language here employed can be made to fit the theory that the ship was only a canoe, it cannot naturally be so interpreted. Moreover, there is mention made in the Rigveda<ref name=fx6_ve1_1627/> of men who go to the ocean ('''[[सम्उद्र|Samudra]]''') eager for gain (''saniṣyavaḥ''). It is not altogether satisfactory to restrict such references with Zimmer<ref name=fx7_ve1_1627/> to the broad stream of the Indus after the union of that river with the tributaries of the Panjab. In the Rigveda<ref name=fx8_ve1_1627/> too it is said that the Aśvins rescued '''[[भुज्यु|Bhujyu]]''' in the ocean with a ship of a hundred oars (''śatāritra''). It is not easy to refuse to recognize here the existence of larger vessels with many oars used for sea voyages. The [[बौधायन|Baudhāyana]] [[धर्म|Dharma]] [[सूत्र|Sūtra]],<ref name=fx9_ve1_1627/> at any rate, clearly refers to maritime navigation. See also '''[[सम्उद्र|Samudra]].'''<br>

<u>'''Pañca-janāḥ,'''</u> the ‘five peoples,’ are mentioned under various names in Vedic literature.<ref name=fx1_ve1_1645/> Who are meant by the five is very uncertain. The [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx2_ve1_1645/> explains the five to be gods, men, Gandharvas and Apsarases, snakes, and the Fathers.  [[औपमन्यव|Aupamanyava]]<ref name=fx3_ve1_1645/> held that the four castes ('''[[वर्ण|Varṇa]]''') and the '''Niṣādas''' made up the five, and Sāyaṇa<ref name=fx4_ve1_1645/> is of the same opinion. [[यास्क|Yāska]]<ref name=fx5_ve1_1645/> thinks that the five are the Gandharvas, fathers, gods, Asuras, and Rakṣases. No one of these explanations can be regarded as probable. Roth<ref name=fx6_ve1_1645/> and Geldner<ref name=fx7_ve1_1645/> think that all the peoples of the earth are méant: just as there are four quarters ('''[[दिश्|Diś]]'''), there are peoples at the four quarters (N. E. S. W.), with the Āryan folk in the middle. Zimmer<ref name=fx8_ve1_1645/> opposes this view on the ground that the inclusion of all peoples in one expression is not in harmony with the distinction so often made between Āryan and [[दास|Dāsa]]; that neither ''janāsaḥ,'' ‘men,’<ref name=fx9_ve1_1645/> nor ''mānuṣāḥ,'' ‘people,’<ref name=fx10_ve1_1645/> could be used of non-Āryans; that the Soma is referred to as being among the five tribes;<ref name=fx11_ve1_1645/> that the five tribes are mentioned as on the '''[[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]],'''<ref name=fx12_ve1_1645/> and that Indra is ''[[पाञ्चजन्य|pāñcajanya]],''<ref name=fx13_ve1_1645/> ‘belonging to the five peoples.’ He concludes that Āryans alone are meant, and in particular the five tribes of the '''Anus, Druhyus, Yadus, Turvaśas,''' and '''Pūrus,''' who are all mentioned together in one or perhaps two hymns of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx14_ve1_1645/> and four of whom occur in another hymn.<ref name=fx15_ve1_1645/> But he admits that the expression might easily be used more generally later. Hopkins<ref name=fx16_ve1_1645/> has combated Zimmer's view, but his own opinion rests mainly on his theory that there was no people named [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]], but only a king of the Yadus called [[तुर्वश|Turvaśa]], and that theory is not very probable. <br><br>In the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx17_ve1_1645/> and the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx18_ve1_1645/> the five peoples are opposed to the Bharatas, and in the former work<ref name=fx19_ve1_1645/> seven peoples are alluded to.<br>

Hillebrandt<ref name=fx5_ve1_1647/> considers that the Rigveda belongs in part to the Panjāb, or rather to Arachosia, and in part to the Middle Country. See also '''Kuru, [[तृत्सु|Tṛtsu]].'''<br>

Pischel<ref name=fx7_ve1_1656/> objects that the sense of ‘foot-fastening’ involves the absurdity, in the [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]] passages, of a fine horse from the '''[[सिन्धु|Sindhu]]''' (Indus) being spoken of as tearing up the peg to which it is fastened.

'''[[वणिज्|Vaṇij]].'''<br>

पणि|paṇi|paNi|పణి|ಪಣಿ|_vei1@1658|_vei1_pn471
<u>'''Paṇi'''</u> in the Rigveda appears to denote a person who is rich, but who does not give offerings to the gods, or bestow '''Dakṣiṇās''' on the priests, and who is therefore an object of intense dislike to the composers of the Saṃhitā.<ref name=fx1_ve1_1658/> Hence the gods are asked to attack the Paṇis, who are also referred to as being defeated with slaughter.<ref name=fx2_ve1_1658/> The [[पणि|Paṇi]] is opposed to the pious sacrificer as a niggard,<ref name=fx3_ve1_1658/> and is spoken of as a wolf,<ref name=fx4_ve1_1658/> the symbol of enmity. In some passages<ref name=fx5_ve1_1658/> the Paṇis definitely appear as mythological figures, demons who withhold the cows or waters of heaven, and to whom Saramā goes on a mission from Indra.<ref name=fx6_ve1_1658/> Among the Paṇis '''[[बृबु|Bṛbu]]''' was apparently important. In one passage of the Rigveda<ref name=fx7_ve1_1658/> they are described as '''Bekanāṭas,''' or ‘usurers’ (?). In another<ref name=fx8_ve1_1658/> they are called '''Dasyus,''' and styled ''[[मृध्र-वाच्|mṛdhra-vāc]],'' probably ‘of hostile speech,’ and ''grathin,'' a word of uncertain meaning. Hillebrandt<ref name=fx9_ve1_1658/> thinks that the latter epithet refers to the continuous flow of a speech which  is not understood, and that ''[[मृध्र-वाच्|mṛdhra-vāc]]'' means ‘śpeaking an enemy's speech,’ though not necessarily with reference to non-Āryans.<ref name=fx10_ve1_1658/> In two passages<ref name=fx11_ve1_1658/> the Paṇis appear as '''Dāsas,''' and in one<ref name=fx12_ve1_1658/> a [[पणि|Paṇi]] is mentioned in connexion with wergeld ('''[[वैर|Vaira]]'''), being apparently regarded as equal to a man merely in the price put on his life, but in other respects as inferior.<br><br>It is difficult to be certain exactly who a [[पणि|Paṇi]] was. Roth<ref name=fx13_ve1_1658/> thinks that the word is derived from ''paṇ,'' ‘barter,’ and that the [[पणि|Paṇi]] is properly the man who will give nothing without return, hence the niggard, who neither worships the gods nor rewards their priests. This view is accepted by Zimmer<ref name=fx14_ve1_1658/> and by Ludwig.<ref name=fx15_ve1_1658/> The latter scholar thinks the apparent references to fights with Paṇis are to be explained by their having been aboriginal traders who went in caravans--as in Arabia and Northern Africa--prepared to fight, if need be, to protect their goods against attacks which the Āryans would naturally deem quite justified. He supports this explanation by the references to the Paṇis as Dasyus and Dāsas. It is, however, hardly necessary to do more than regard the Paṇis generally as non-worshippers of the gods favoured by the singers; the term is wide enough to cover either the aborigines or hostile Āryan tribes, as well as demons. Hillebrandt,<ref name=fx16_ve1_1658/> however, thinks that a real tribe is meant, the Parnians of Strabo, and that they were associated with the Dahae ('''[[दास|Dāsa]]'''). Moreover, he finds them associated in one passage<ref name=fx17_ve1_1658/> with the '''Pārāvatas,''' whom  he identifies with the  of Ptolemy,<ref name=fx18_ve1_1658/> and with '''Bṛṣaya,''' whom he connects with  of Arrian;<ref name=fx19_ve1_1658/> he also considers that the frequent<ref name=fx20_ve1_1658/> mention of the Paṇis as opponents of '''Divodāsa''' shows that the latter was on the Arachosian Haraqaiti ('''[[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]]''') fighting against the Parnians and Dahae, as well as other Iranian tribes. But the identification of [[पणि|Paṇi]] and the Parnians is needless, especially as the root ''paṇ,'' which is found also in the Greek , shows a satisfactory derivation, while the transfer of Divodāsa to the Haraqaiti is improbable.

<u>'''Pati, Patnī.'''</u>--Under these words denoting primarily, as the evidence collected in the St. Petersburg Dictionary shows, ‘lord’ and ‘lady,’ and so ‘husband’ and ‘wife,’ it is convenient to consider the marital relations of the Vedic community.<br><br>''Child Marriage.''--Marriage in the early Vedic texts appears essentially as a union of two persons of full development. This is shown by the numerous references<ref name=fx1_ve1_1665/> to unmarried girls who grow old in the house of their fathers (''[[अमा-जुर्|amā-jur]]''), and who adorn themselves in desire of marriage, as well as to the paraphernalia of spells and potions used in the Atharvavedic tradition<ref name=fx2_ve1_1665/> to compel the love of man or woman respectively, while even the Rigveda<ref name=fx3_ve1_1665/> itself seems to present us with a spell by which a  lover seeks to send all the household to sleep when he visits his beloved. Child wives first occur regularly in the [[सूत्र|Sūtra]] period, though it is still uncertain to what extent the rule of marriage before puberty there obtained.<ref name=fx4_ve1_1665/> The marriage ritual also quite clearly presumes that the marriage is a real and not a nominal one: an essential feature is the taking of the bride to her husband's home, and the ensuing cohabitation.<ref name=fx5_ve1_1665/><br><br>''Limitations on Marriage.''--It is difficult to say with certainty within what limits marriage was allowed. The dialogue of Yama and Yamī in the Rigveda<ref name=fx6_ve1_1665/> seems clearly to point to a prohibition of the marriage of brother and sister. It can hardly be said, as Weber<ref name=fx7_ve1_1665/> thinks, to point to a practice that was once in use and later became antiquated. In the Gobhila [[गृह्य|Gṛhya]] [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx8_ve1_1665/> and the [[धर्म|Dharma]] Sūtras<ref name=fx9_ve1_1665/> are found prohibitions against marriage in the '''[[गोत्र|Gotra]]''' (‘family’) or within six degrees on the mother's or father's side, but in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx10_ve1_1665/> marriage is allowed in the third or fourth generation, the former being allowed, according to Harisvamin,<ref name=fx11_ve1_1665/> by the Kāṇvas, and the second by the Saurāṣṭras, while the Dākṣiṇātyas allowed marriage with the daughter of the mother's brother or the son of the father's sister, but presumably not with the daughter of the mother's sister or the son of the father's brother. The prohibition of marriage within the [[गोत्र|Gotra]] cannot then have existed,<ref name=fx12_ve1_1665/> though naturally marriages  outside the [[गोत्र|Gotra]] were frequent.<ref name=fx13_ve1_1665/> Similarity of caste was also not an essential to marriage, as hypergamy was permitted even by the [[धर्म|Dharma]] Sūtras,<ref name=fx14_ve1_1665/> so that a [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] could marry wives of any lower caste, a [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] wives of the two lowest castes as well as of his own caste, a [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] a [[शूद्रा|Śūdrā]] as well as a Vaiśyā, although the [[शूद्रा|Śūdrā]] marriages were later disapproved ''in toto.'' Instances of such intermarriage are common in the Epic, and are viewed as normal in the Bṛhaddevatā.<ref name=fx15_ve1_1665/><br><br>It was considered proper that the younger brothers and sisters should not anticipate their elders by marrying before them. The later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas<ref name=fx16_ve1_1665/> present a series of names expressive of such anticipation, censuring as sinful those who bear them. These terms are the ''pari-vividāna,''<ref name=fx17_ve1_1665/> or perhaps ''agre-dadhus,''<ref name=fx18_ve1_1665/> the man who, though a younger brother, marries before his elder brother, the latter being then called the ''[[परिवित्त|parivitta]];''<ref name=fx19_ve1_1665/> the ''agre-[[दिधिषु|didhiṣu]],''<ref name=fx20_ve1_1665/> the man who weds a younger daughter while her elder sister is still unmarried; and the '''[[दिधिषू-पति|Didhiṣū-pati]],'''<ref name=fx21_ve1_1665/> who is the husband of the latter. The passages do not explicitly say that the exact order of birth must always be followed, but the mention of the terms shows that the order was often broken.<br><br>''Widow Remarriage.''--The remarriage of a widow was  apparently permitted. This seems originally to have taken the form of the marriage of the widow to the brother or other nearest kinsman of the dead man in order to produce children. At any rate, the ceremony is apparently alluded to in a funeral hymn of the Rigveda;<ref name=fx22_ve1_1665/> for the alternative explanation, which sees in the verse a reference to the ritual of the Puruṣamendha (‘human sacrifice’), although accepted by Hillebrandt<ref name=fx23_ve1_1665/> and Delbrück,<ref name=fx24_ve1_1665/> is not at all probable, while the ordinary view is supported by the [[सूत्र|Sūtra]] evidence.<ref name=fx25_ve1_1665/> Moreover, another passage of the Rigveda<ref name=fx26_ve1_1665/> clearly refers to the marriage of the widow and the husband's brother (''[[देवृ|devṛ]]''), which constitutes what the Indians later knew as Niyoga.<ref name=fx27_ve1_1665/> This custom was probably not followed except in cases where no son was already born. This custom was hardly remarriage in the strict sense, since the brother might--so far as appears--be already married himself. In the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx28_ve1_1665/> a verse refers to a charm which would secure the reunion, in the next world, of a wife and her second husband. Though, as Delbrück<ref name=fx29_ve1_1665/> thinks, this very possibly refers to a case in which the first husband was still alive,<ref name=fx30_ve1_1665/> but was impotent or had lost caste (''patita''),<ref name=fx31_ve1_1665/> still it is certain that the later [[धर्म|Dharma]] Sūtras<ref name=fx32_ve1_1665/> began to recognize ordinary remarriage in case of the death of the first husband.  Pischel<ref name=fx33_ve1_1665/> finds some evidence in the Rigveda<ref name=fx34_ve1_1665/> to the effect that a woman could remarry if her husband disappeared and could not be found or heard of.<br><br>''Polygamy.''--A Vedic Indian could have more than one wife. This is proved clearly by many passages in the Rigveda;<ref name=fx35_ve1_1665/> Manu, according to the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx36_ve1_1665/> had ten wives; and the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx37_ve1_1665/> explains polygamy by a characteristic legend. Moreover, the king regularly has four wives attributed to him, the [[महिषी|Mahiṣī]],<ref name=fx38_ve1_1665/> the Parivṛktī,<ref name=fx39_ve1_1665/> the [[वावाता|Vāvātā]],<ref name=fx40_ve1_1665/> and the [[पालागली|Pālāgalī]].<ref name=fx41_ve1_1665/> The [[महिषी|Mahiṣī]] appears to be the chief wife, being the first one married according to the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx42_ve1_1665/> The Parivṛktī, ‘the neglected,’ is explained by Weber<ref name=fx43_ve1_1665/> and Pischel<ref name=fx44_ve1_1665/> as one that has had no son. The [[वावाता|Vāvātā]] is ‘the favourite,’ while the [[पालागली|Pālāgalī]] is, according to Weber, the daughter of the last of the court officials. The names are curious, and not very intelligible, but the evidence points to the wife first wedded alone being a wife in the fullest sense. This view is supported by the fact emphasized by  Delbrück,<ref name=fx45_ve1_1665/> that in the sacrifice the [[पत्नी|Patnī]] is usually mentioned in the singular, apparent exceptions being due to some mythological reason.<ref name=fx46_ve1_1665/> Zimmer<ref name=fx47_ve1_1665/> is of opinion that polygamy is dying out in the Rigvedic period, monogamy being developed from pologamy; Weber,<ref name=fx48_ve1_1665/> however, thinks that polygamy is secondary, a view that is supported by more recent anthropology.<ref name=fx49_ve1_1665/><br><br>''Polyandry.''--On the other hand, polyandry is not Vedic.<ref name=fx50_ve1_1665/> There is no passage containing any clear reference to such a custom. The most that can be said is that in the Rigveda<ref name=fx51_ve1_1665/> and the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx52_ve1_1665/> verses are occasionally found in which husbands are mentioned in relation to a single wife. It is difficult to be certain of the correct explanation of each separate instance of this mode of expression; but even if Weber's<ref name=fx53_ve1_1665/> view, that the plural is here used ''majestatis causā,'' is not accepted, Delbrück's<ref name=fx54_ve1_1665/> explanation by mythology is probably right. In other passages<ref name=fx55_ve1_1665/> the plural is simply generic.<br><br>''Marital Relations.''--Despite polygamy, however, there is ample evidence that the marriage tie was not, as Weber<ref name=fx56_ve1_1665/> has suggested, lightly regarded as far as the fidelity of the wife was concerned. There is, however, little trace of the husband's being expected to be faithful as a matter of morality. Several  passages,<ref name=fx57_ve1_1665/> indeed, forbid, with reference to ritual abstinence, intercourse with the ''[[स्त्री|strī]]'' of another. This may imply that adultery on the husband's part was otherwise regarded as venial. But as the word ''[[स्त्री|strī]]'' includes all the ‘womenfolk,’ daughters and slaves, as well as wife, the conclusion can hardly be drawn that intercourse with another man's ‘wife’ was normally regarded with indifference.<ref name=fx58_ve1_1665/> The curious ritual of the Varuṇapraghāsās,<ref name=fx59_ve1_1665/> in which the wife of the sacrificer is questioned as to her lovers, is shown by Delbrück<ref name=fx60_ve1_1665/> to be a part of a rite meant to expiate unchastity on the part of a wife, not as a normal question for a sacrificer to put to his own wife. Again, Yājñavalkya's doctrine in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx61_ve1_1665/> which seems to assert that no one cares if a wife is unchaste (''paraḥ-puṃsā'') or not, really means that no one cares if the wife is away from the men who are sacrificing, as the wives of the gods are apart from them during the particular rite in question. Monogamy is also evidently approved,<ref name=fx62_ve1_1665/> so that some higher idea of morality was in course of formation. On the other hand, no Vedic text gives us the rule well known to other Indo-Germanic<ref name=fx63_ve1_1665/> peoples that the adulterer taken in the act can be killed with impunity, though the later legal literature has traces of this rule.<ref name=fx64_ve1_1665/> There is also abundant evidence that the standard of ordinary sexual morality was not high.<br><br>''Hetairai.''--In the Rigveda<ref name=fx65_ve1_1665/> there are many references to illegitimate love and to the abandonment of the offspring of  such unions,<ref name=fx66_ve1_1665/> especially in the case of a protégé of Indra, often mentioned as the ''parāvṛkta'' or ''[[परावृज्|parāvṛj]].''<ref name=fx67_ve1_1665/> The ‘son of a maiden’ (''kumārī-[[पुत्र|putra]]'') is already spoken of in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.<ref name=fx68_ve1_1665/> Such a person appears with a metronymic in the [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]] period:<ref name=fx69_ve1_1665/> this custom may be the origin of metronymics such as those which make up a great part of the lists of teachers (Vaṃśas) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]].<ref name=fx70_ve1_1665/> The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<ref name=fx71_ve1_1665/> refers to illicit unions of [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] and [[आर्य|Ārya]], both male and female, besides giving in its list of victims at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ several whose designations apparently mean ‘courtesan’ (''atītvarī'')<ref name=fx72_ve1_1665/> and ‘procuress of abortion’ (''atiṣkadvarī''),<ref name=fx73_ve1_1665/> while the ‘dyeing woman’ (''[[रजयित्री|rajayitrī]]'') is dedicated to sensuality.<ref name=fx74_ve1_1665/> Pischel and Geldner also see many references to Hetairai in other passages of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx75_ve1_1665/> especially where mention is made of Uṣas, the goddess of Dawn, who in their view is the characteristic Hetaira. At any rate, there is little doubt that the ‘dancer’ (''[[नृतू|nṛtū]]'') referred to in one passage of the Rigveda<ref name=fx76_ve1_1665/> was a Hetaira. When women are referred to as going to the '''[[समन|Samana]],''' or ‘place of meeting,’ Hetairai are probably also meant.<ref name=fx77_ve1_1665/> Grave cases of immorality are alluded to in the Rigveda.<ref name=fx78_ve1_1665/> The love of father and daughter, as shown in the myth of Prajāpati,<ref name=fx79_ve1_1665/> is evidently censured, but the actual existence of this form of incest is recognized in the Atharvaveda.<ref name=fx80_ve1_1665/> Girls who had lost their  natural protectors--father or brother<ref name=fx81_ve1_1665/> --were apt to be reduced to live by immorality.<br><br>''Forms of Marriage.''--The state of society revealed in the Vedic age seems to point to considerable freedom on the part of both man and woman in selecting a wife or a husband. At any rate, it is not clear that either the father or the mother controlled the marriage of son or daughter of mature age,<ref name=fx82_ve1_1665/> though no doubt the parents or parent often arranged a suitable match.<ref name=fx83_ve1_1665/> The marriage was frequently arranged through an intermediary, the ‘wooer’ (''vara''),<ref name=fx84_ve1_1665/> presumably after those concerned had in effect come to an agreement. The sale of a daughter was not unknown,<ref name=fx85_ve1_1665/> but a certain amount of discredit would seem to have attached to it,<ref name=fx86_ve1_1665/> and sons-in-law in such cases were sometimes stingy. On the other hand, dowries were not infrequently given, especially no doubt when damsels Suffered from bodily defects.<ref name=fx87_ve1_1665/> Occasionally marriages by  capture may have taken place, but only as knightly feats, as when '''[[विमद|Vimada]]''' carried off '''Purumitra's''' daughter against her father's wish, but very possibly with her own consent.<ref name=fx88_ve1_1665/> The later law-books and the Epic describe in much detail various forms of marriage, but they all seem reducible to three types: (''a'') that which is based on mutual consent, the ''prājāpatya'' (‘connected with Prajāpati’); (''b'') that in which a price is paid for the bride, the ''āsura'' (‘Asura-like’), ''ārṣa'' (‘connected with the Ṛṣis’), ''brāhma'' (‘relating to Brahman’), or ''[[दैव|daiva]]'' (‘divine’); (''c'') those which consist in stealing the bride, the ''kṣātra'' (‘warrior-like’) or the ''rākṣasa'' (‘demon-like’) mode, of all of which traces are found in Vedic literature.<ref name=fx89_ve1_1665/> For instance, the gift of a maiden for services rendered or other object is exemplified in the story of '''[[च्यवन|Cyavana]]''' in the Jaiminīya [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx90_ve1_1665/> and in that of '''[[श्यावाश्व|Śyāvāśva]]''' in the Bṛhaddevatā.<ref name=fx91_ve1_1665/><br><br>''Wedding Ceremony.''--In normal marriages the bridal was celebrated by an elaborate ceremony which bears in essentials and details the strongest resemblance to the form observed by other Indo-Germanic as well as non-Indo-Germanic peoples,<ref name=fx92_ve1_1665/> and which was destined to secure the stability and fruitfulness of the union. The ceremony commenced at the bride's house,<ref name=fx93_ve1_1665/> to which the bridegroom with his friends and relations repaired, and in which he met the friends and relations of the bride.<ref name=fx94_ve1_1665/> A cow or cows were slain for the entertainment of the guests.<ref name=fx95_ve1_1665/> The bridegroom having caused the bride to mount a stone, formally grasped her hand, and led her round the household  fire.<ref name=fx96_ve1_1665/> This act constituted the marriage, the husband hence being called ‘he who takes by the hand’ (''[[हस्त|hasta]]-[[ग्राभ|grābha]]'').<ref name=fx97_ve1_1665/> The festivities being over,<ref name=fx98_ve1_1665/> the bridegroom took the bride to his home on a car in a marriage procession,<ref name=fx99_ve1_1665/> all to the accompaniment of suitable stanzas. Then followed cohabitation.<ref name=fx100_ve1_1665/><br><br>''Wife's Property and Status.''--We have very little information as to the legal relations of wife and husband after marriage. It may be assumed that the husband appropriated the wife's dowry, if any, as well as her earnings, if any: even in the Epic<ref name=fx101_ve1_1665/> the rise of the recognition of women's property as their own (''[[स्त्री|strī]]-[[धन|dhana]]'') is only slow. That the husband was absolute master of a wife as of a slave is not probable, though he doubtless exercised the same power of correction as was expressly allowed in the eighteenth century by English law. The poetical ideal<ref name=fx102_ve1_1665/> of the family was decidedly high, and we have no reason to doubt that it was often actually fulfilled. Moreover, the wife on her marriage was at once given an honoured position in the house; she is emphatically mistress in her husband's home, exercising authority over her fatherin-law, her husband's brothers, and her unmarried sisters.<ref name=fx103_ve1_1665/> No doubt the case contemplated is one in which the eldest son  of a family has become its head owing to the decrepitude<ref name=fx104_ve1_1665/> of the parents, his wife then taking the place of the mistress of the joint family while the brothers and sisters are still unmarried. It is not inconsistent with the great stress elsewhere<ref name=fx105_ve1_1665/> laid on the respect due to a father-in-law, who then is probably regarded as still in full possession of his faculties, and controls the house while his son continues to live with him. The respect would no doubt equally apply if the son had set up a separate family of his own.<ref name=fx106_ve1_1665/><br><br>Moreover, the wife was a regular participator in the offerings of the husband. In this connexion the term '''[[पत्नी|Patnī]]''' regularly applies to her in the Brāhmaṇas,<ref name=fx107_ve1_1665/> where '''[[जाया|Jāyā]]''' designates her in her conjugal capacity, not in that of sharer in the sacrifice. In this respect her position gradually deteriorated: thus the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx108_ve1_1665/> describes a certain ceremony in which the wife (''[[जाया|jāyā]]'') alone offered the oblation in former times, while later a priest might do so instead. The same [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] shows other traces of a lowering in the position of women, probably due to the growing sense of the importance of ceremonial priority.<ref name=fx109_ve1_1665/> So in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<ref name=fx110_ve1_1665/> women generally are classed with dice and drink as three chief evils, and woman is declared to be ‘untruth,’<ref name=fx111_ve1_1665/> and connected with Nirṛti, ‘calamity.’<ref name=fx112_ve1_1665/> A woman too, according to the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx113_ve1_1665/> is inferior even to a bad man, and a sarcastic reference is made in the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx114_ve1_1665/> to her power of  getting things from her husband by cajolery at night. On the other hand must be set the encomia on woman: a woman is half her husband,<ref name=fx115_ve1_1665/> and completes him;<ref name=fx116_ve1_1665/> and in the Rigveda<ref name=fx117_ve1_1665/> attacks on women mingle with the general assumption of their good qualities. None the less, the Brāhmaṇas clearly indicate a gradual decline in their position, which is evident from the rule that requires the wife to eat after her husband.<ref name=fx118_ve1_1665/> Scolds were also known: the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx119_ve1_1665/> praises the wife ‘who does not answer back’ (''aprativādinī''). Women bore no part in political life: men go to the assembly, not women, the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<ref name=fx120_ve1_1665/> expressly says. On the other hand, with the advance of education, women shared in the intellectual interests of the day, as is exemplified by Yājñavalkya's<ref name=fx121_ve1_1665/> two wives, of whom one was interested in his philosophical discussions, the other not. Other women are also referred to in the Upaniṣads as teachers, but whether they were married is not certain.<ref name=fx122_ve1_1665/><br><br>But the main object of a woman's marriage was the production of children, this being repeatedly asserted in the Rigveda and later.<ref name=fx123_ve1_1665/> The desire for offspring, as was natural in a society which mainly counted relationship through the father, took the form of a wish for a son to perform the necessary funeral rites for the father, and to continue his line. It was no doubt possible to adopt a son, but in the Rigveda<ref name=fx124_ve1_1665/> this custom is plainly viewed as unsatisfactory. The practice  is recognized,<ref name=fx125_ve1_1665/> as we have seen above of Niyoga, in the appointment of a brother to beget children with the wife of a dead man, or perhaps of a man who is childless. ‘Sonlessness’ (''avīratā'') is placed on the same level as lack of property (''amati''), and Agni is besought to protect from it.<ref name=fx126_ve1_1665/> The birth of a daughter was certainly not specially welcome: the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx127_ve1_1665/> in one hymn distinctly invokes the birth of a son, and deprecates that of a daughter, while the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx128_ve1_1665/> contains an old verse which says that a daughter is a misery (''kṛpaṇam''), while a son is a light in the highest heaven (''jyotir ha putraḥ parame vyoman''). But there is no proof that the Vedic Indians practised the exposure of female children. This conclusion, deduced from certain passages in the later Saṃhitās<ref name=fx129_ve1_1665/> by Zimmer<ref name=fx130_ve1_1665/> and Delbrück,<ref name=fx131_ve1_1665/> has been disproved by Bo7htlingk.<br><br>''Child Life.''--No doubt the care of a child was left to the mother, but we learn little from the earlier literature<ref name=fx132_ve1_1665/> of the life of the young. The length of the period of pregnancy is frequently placed at ten (doubtless lunar) months.<ref name=fx133_ve1_1665/> On birth the child was first fed with milk or ghee, and then given the breast.<ref name=fx134_ve1_1665/> On the eighth day after birth  the infant was washed.<ref name=fx135_ve1_1665/> The cutting of the teeth was also a solemn occasion,<ref name=fx136_ve1_1665/> and is the subject of a hymn in the Atharvaveda. Reference is also made to children's learning to speak, which the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx137_ve1_1665/> ascribes to the end of the first year of life. The [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] Āraṇyaka<ref name=fx138_ve1_1665/> asserts that the words '''Tata''' and '''[[तात|Tāta]],''' onomatopoetic words like ‘dada,’<ref name=fx139_ve1_1665/> are the first words of a child's speech, giving therein perhaps an unfair prominence to the father. The Atharvaveda<ref name=fx140_ve1_1665/> further contains at least one hymn for the ceremony of the first shaving of the young man's beard. The giving of a name was also an occasion of importance, a second one being often added.<ref name=fx141_ve1_1665/><br><br>''Satī.''--On the death of her husband, in some cases the widow burned herself or was burned by his relations.<ref name=fx142_ve1_1665/> This is clearly implied in the reference to this ancient custom in the Atharvaveda.<ref name=fx143_ve1_1665/> On the other hand, the Rigveda does not contemplate the custom anywhere, but on the contrary considers the widow as married apparently to the brother of the dead man.<ref name=fx144_ve1_1665/> The custom of Suttee would therefore appear buring the Vedic age to have been in abeyance, at least as a general rule. At all times the practice seems to have been mainly usual among families of the warrior class, to judge from the other Indo-Germanic parallels.<ref name=fx145_ve1_1665/> In other classes  the survival of wives was more necessary, and the remarriage of widows, whether prohibited or allowed in the texts, is proof that there were widows who could be remarried.<ref name=fx146_ve1_1665/><br>

<u>'''Patti'''</u> is used in the Atharvaveda (vii. 62, 1) to designate the ‘foot soldier’ in war as opposed to the '''[[रथिन्|Rathin]],''' ‘charioteer,’ the latter defeating (''ji'') the former. One of the epithets of Rudra in the [[शतरुद्रिय|Śatarudriya]] liturgy of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (xvi. 19) is ‘lord of footmen’ (''pattīnāṃ pati'').<br>

<u>'''Pathi-kṛt,'''</u> ‘path-maker,’ is not a rare epithet in the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_1669/> and later,<ref name=fx2_ve1_1669/> showing clearly the importance naturally attached in primitive times to the finding of roads. The frequency  with which the epithet is applied to Agni<ref name=fx3_ve1_1669/> suggests that there is here an allusion to fire burning the primæval forest and rendering advance possible. The god Pūṣan is ''[[पथि-कृत्|pathi-kṛt]],'' as guarding the flocks.<ref name=fx4_ve1_1669/> The [[ऋषिस्|Ṛṣis]],<ref name=fx5_ve1_1669/> or seers, as ‘path-makers,’ may be compared with the Roman Pontifices.<br>

<u>'''Pad'''</u> in the Atharvaveda (xix. 6, 2) and the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] (xi. 3, 2, 3) denotes a ‘quarter.’ This sense is derived from the primary meaning of ‘foot,’ which as applied to quadrupeds would represent ‘one-fourth.’ ''Cf.'' '''[[पाद|Pāda]].'''<br>

पद|pada|పద|ಪದ|_vei1@1671|_vei1_pn490

More doubtful is the meaning of the word ''paraśvā(n)'' in the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]],<ref name=fx5_ve1_1679/> where the commentary explains it as ‘serpent.’ It is, of course, quite possible that the word has nothing to do with ''[[परस्वन्त्|parasvant]].''

<u>'''Parā-vṛj'''</u> is a term found in four passages of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx1_ve1_1680/> in all of which it refers to a person in a forlorn condition, while one<ref name=fx2_ve1_1680/> of them also speaks of him as going south. Sāyaṇa's<ref name=fx3_ve1_1680/> view that the word is a proper name is most unlikely, while Grassmann's<ref name=fx4_ve1_1680/> explanation of it as ‘cripple’ is still less probable.  Roth's<ref name=fx5_ve1_1680/> interpretation of it as ‘exile’ seems clearly right in the passage which refers to the [[परावृज्|Parāvṛj]] as going south. Zimmer<ref name=fx6_ve1_1680/> accepts Roth's view for this passage, but in the others sees a reference to the child of a maiden exposed by her and in danger of being eaten by insects (''vamrī''). This view is supported by the fact that ''parāvṛkta'' seems to have the same sense,<ref name=fx7_ve1_1680/> and is accepted by Oldenberg.<ref name=fx8_ve1_1680/><br>

According to the [[निरुक्त|Nirukta]]<ref name=fx2_ve1_1681/> he was a son of [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]], but the Epic version makes him a son of '''[[शक्ति|Śakti]]''' and grandson of [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]]. Geldner<ref name=fx3_ve1_1681/> thinks that he is mentioned in the Rigveda along with [[शतयातु|Śatayātu]], perhaps his uncle, and his grandfather [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]], as the three sages who approached Indra and won his favour for [[सुदास्|Sudās]]. He is erroneously credited with the authorship of certain hymns of the Rigveda<ref name=fx4_ve1_1681/> by the Anukramaṇī (Index).<br>

<u>'''Pari-kṣit'''</u> appears in the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_1682/> as a king in whose realm, that of the Kurus, prosperity and peace abound. The verses in which he is celebrated are later<ref name=fx2_ve1_1682/> called ''Pārikṣityaḥ,'' and the Brāhmaṇas explain that Agni is ''[[परि-क्षित्|pari-kṣit]]'' because he dwells among men. Hence Roth<ref name=fx3_ve1_1682/> and Bloomfield<ref name=fx4_ve1_1682/> regard [[परिक्षित्|Parikṣit]] in the Atharvaveda not as a human king at all. This may be correct, but it is not certain. Both Zimmer<ref name=fx5_ve1_1682/> and  Oldenberg<ref name=fx6_ve1_1682/> recognize [[परिक्षित्|Parikṣit]] as a real king, a view supported by the fact that in the later Vedic literature King '''[[जनम्एजय|Janamejaya]]''' bears the patronymic '''[[पारिक्षित|Pārikṣita]].''' If this be so, [[परिक्षित्|Parikṣit]] belonged to the later period, since the [[अथर्वन्|Atharvan]] passage in which his name occurs is certainly late, and none of the other Saṃhitās know [[परिक्षित्|Parikṣit]] at all. The Epic<ref name=fx7_ve1_1682/> makes him grandfather of Pratiśravas and great-grandfather of Pratīpa, and Zimmer,<ref name=fx5_ve1_1682/> probably with justice, compares the [[प्रातिसुत्वन|Prātisutvana]] and Pratīpa found in another late [[अथर्वन्|Atharvan]] passage.<ref name=fx8_ve1_1682/> But '''Devāpi''' and '''Śantanu''' cannot be brought into connexion with Pratīpa.<ref name=fx9_ve1_1682/><br>

Pischel suggests that the name is derived from the ‘flocks’ (''[[परुस्|parus]]'') of wool, not from the bends of the river, as understood by the [[निरुक्त|Nirukta]],<ref name=fx5_ve1_1713/> or from its reeds, as Roth<ref name=fx10_ve1_1713/> suggests. <br><br>The mention of the [[परुष्णी|Paruṣṇī]] and the [[यमुना|Yamunā]] in the hymn celebrating the victory of [[सुदास्|Sudās]] has given rise to the conjectures of Hopkins,<ref name=fx11_ve1_1713/> that the [[यमुना|Yamunā]] in that hymn is merely another name for the [[परुष्णी|Paruṣṇī]], and of Geldner,<ref name=fx12_ve1_1713/> that the [[परुष्णी|Paruṣṇī]] there is merely a tributary of the [[यमुना|Yamunā]] (Jumna). But neither interpretation is either essential or even probable. The hymn is a condensed one, and may well be taken as celebrating two great victories of [[सुदास्|Sudās]].

<u>'''4. Parśu'''</u> occurs in one passage in a Dānastuti (‘praise of gifts’) in the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_1730/> as the name of a man. It is not certain that he is identical with '''[[तिरिन्दिर|Tirindira]],''' but the [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx2_ve1_1730/> mentions [[तिरिन्दिर|Tirindira]] [[पारशव्य|Pāraśavya]] as the patron of '''[[वत्स|Vatsa]] [[काण्व|Kāṇva]].''' In another passage occurring in the Vṛṣākapi hymn,<ref name=fx3_ve1_1730/> [[पर्शु|Parśu]] [[मानवी|Mānavī]] occurs, apparently as a woman, daughter of Manu, but who is meant it is quite impossible to say. Excepting these two, there are no other occurrences in which the word has with any probability the value of a proper name in the Rigveda.<br><br>Ludwig,<ref name=fx4_ve1_1730/> however, sees in several other places an allusion to the Parśus. Thus in one passage of the Rigveda<ref name=fx5_ve1_1730/> he finds a reference to the defeat of '''Kuruśravaṇa''' by the Parśus; in another<ref name=fx6_ve1_1730/> he finds a reference to the Pṛthus and Parśus--''i.e.,'' the Parthians and the Persians. He also sees the Parthians in '''[[पार्थव|Pārthava]],''' a name found in one hymn.<ref name=fx7_ve1_1730/> The same view is taken by Weber,<ref name=fx8_ve1_1730/> who holds that historical connexions with the  Persians are referred to. But Zimmer<ref name=fx9_ve1_1730/> points out that this conclusion is not justified; the Parśus were known to Pāṇini<ref name=fx10_ve1_1730/> as a warrior tribe; the Pāraśavas were a tribe in south-west '''[[मध्यदेश|Madhyadeśa]];''' and the ''Periplus''<ref name=fx11_ve1_1730/> knows a tribe of Parthoi in north India. At most the only conclusion to be drawn is that the Indians and Iranians were early connected, as was of course the case.

पवन|pavana|పవన|ಪವನ|_vei1@1740|_vei1_pn507
<u>'''Pavana'''</u> (‘purifier’) in the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_1740/> denotes an instrument for purifying grain from husks, etc.; either a ‘sieve’ or a ‘winnowing basket’ may be meant.

पवमान|pavamāna|pavamaana|పవమాన|ಪವಮಾನ|_vei1@1741|_vei1_pn507
<u>'''Pavamāna'''</u> is a term very frequently applied in the Rigveda to the Soma ‘purifying itself’ by running through the sieve. Later it appears in a few passages<ref name=fx1_ve1_1741/> in the sense of ‘wind’ (as a purifier).<br>

पवस्त|pavasta|పవస్త|ಪವಸ್ತ|_vei1@1742|_vei1_pn507

पवि|pavi|పవి|ಪವಿ|_vei1@1743|_vei1_pn507
<u>'''Pavi'''</u> denotes the ‘tire’ of the wheel of a chariot in the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve1_1743/> and later.<ref name=fx2_ve1_1743/> Reference is made<ref name=fx3_ve1_1743/> to the necessity for fastening it on firmly, and the epithet ''su-pavi,'' ‘having a good tire,’ is found in the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx4_ve1_1743/> with ''su-[[नाभि|nābhi]],'' ‘having a good nave,’ and ''su-[[चक्र|cakra]],'' ‘having a good wheel.’ The tires were, of course, of metal,<ref name=fx5_ve1_1743/> and being sharp,<ref name=fx6_ve1_1743/> could serve on occasion as weapons.<ref name=fx7_ve1_1743/> The St. Petersburg Dictionary in one passage of  the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<ref name=fx8_ve1_1743/> takes Pavi to mean a metal rim on the stone for pounding Soma, but this seems improbable, because no such metal attachment is elsewhere alluded to. Hillebrandt<ref name=fx9_ve1_1743/> seems clearly right in accepting the sense of ‘sharp edge’ in this passage, especially as the stones in the Rigveda<ref name=fx10_ve1_1743/> are, in allusion to their rolling action, styled ‘rims without horses and without chariots’ (''anaśvāsaḥ pavayo 'rathāḥ'').<br><br>The [[निरुक्त|Nirukta]]<ref name=fx11_ve1_1743/> ascribes to Pavi the sense of arrow (''[[शल्य|śalya]]''), but this is very uncertain. The St. Petersburg Dictionary cites for this use two passages of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx12_ve1_1743/> but in one the secondary sense of sharp-edged weapon with reference to the bolt of Indra is quite likely, and in the other, where the expression ''vāṇasya pavi'' occurs, the sharp-edged pounding-stone of the ‘reed,’<ref name=fx13_ve1_1743/> meaning the stalk of the Soma plant, may be meant. Hillebrandt<ref name=fx14_ve1_1743/> thinks a reference to the shape of the Soma plant is intended. Pavī-nasa, the name of a demon mentioned in the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx15_ve1_1743/> seems to throw no light on this point, for while the St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it to mean ‘whose nose is like a spearhead,’ it is translated as ‘rim-nosed’ (presumably in allusion to the curved shape of the nose) by Whitney.<ref name=fx16_ve1_1743/><br>

पवित्र|pavitra|పవిత్ర|ಪವಿತ್ರ|_vei1@1744|_vei1_pn508

It seems clearly<ref name=fx4_ve1_1744/> to have been made of  sheep's wool, whether woven or plaited is not certain, for the expressions used are too vague to be decisive, though Zimmer<ref name=fx5_ve1_1744/> thinks ''hvarāṃsi''<ref name=fx6_ve1_1744/> points to plaiting.<br>

<u>'''Pavīra,'''</u> according to the [[निरुक्त|Nirukta]],<ref name=fx1_ve1_1745/> denotes a ‘lance.’ The epithet derived from this word, ''pavīravant'' or ''pavīrava,'' which is found in the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx2_ve1_1745/> and the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]] Saṃhitās,<ref name=fx3_ve1_1745/> is used of the plough, apparently in the sense of ‘having a metal share.’ The same epithet occurs in the Rigveda<ref name=fx4_ve1_1745/> applied to a man, in the sense of ‘having a goad’ or ‘having a spear.’<br>

पशु|paśu|pashu|పశు|ಪಶು|_vei1@1747|_vei1_pn509
<u>'''Paśu'''</u> means ‘animal’ generally, including man. There is frequent mention<ref name=fx1_ve1_1747/> of the five sacrificial animals--the horse, the cow, the sheep, the goat, and man. Seven such domestic animals are spoken of in the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx2_ve1_1747/> and later;<ref name=fx3_ve1_1747/> probably, as Whitney<ref name=fx4_ve1_1747/> observes, merely as a sacred mystic number, not, as the commentator<ref name=fx5_ve1_1747/> explains, the usual five with the ass and the camel added. Animals are also referred to as ''ubhayadant''  and ''anyatodant.'' They are further<ref name=fx6_ve1_1747/> classified as those which take hold with the hand (''hastādānāḥ''), man (''[[पुरुष|puruṣa]]''), elephant (''[[हस्तिन्|hastin]]''), and ape (''[[मर्कट|markaṭa]]''), and those which grasp by the mouth (''mukhādānāḥ'').

The division into ''āraṇya'' and ''grāmya'' animals is quite common.<ref name=fx15_ve1_1747/> In the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]] Saṃhitās<ref name=fx16_ve1_1747/> is found a division into ''eka-[[शफ|śapha]],'' ‘whole-hoofed’; ''kṣudra,'' ‘small’; and ''āraṇya,'' ‘wild,’ the two former classes denoting the tame animals.<ref name=fx16_ve1_1747/> The horse and the ass are ''eka-[[शफ|śapha]];''<ref name=fx17_ve1_1747/> the ''kṣudra'' are the sheep, the goat, and the ox: this distinction being parallel to that of ''ubhayadant'' and ''anyatodant.''<ref name=fx18_ve1_1747/> Zimmer<ref name=fx19_ve1_1747/> sees in a passage of the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx20_ve1_1747/> a division of wild animals (''āraṇya'') into five classes: (1) those of the jungle described as the ‘dread beasts  which are in the wood’ (''mṛgā bhīmā vane hitāḥ''); (2) winged creatures, represented by the '''[[हंस|Haṃsa]],''' ‘gander,’ '''[[सुपर्ण|Suparṇa]],''' ‘eagle,’ '''[[शकुन|Śakuna]],''' ‘bird’; (3) amphibia--'''[[शिंशुमार|Śiṃśumāra]],''' ‘alligator,’ and '''[[अजगर|Ajagara]],''' ‘crocodile’ (?); (4) ‘fish,’ '''[[पुरीकय|Purīkaya]], [[जष|Jaṣa]],''' and '''[[मत्स्य|Matsya]];''' (5) insects and worms (described as ''rajasāḥ'').

पितृ|pitṛ|pitR|పితృ|ಪಿತೃ|pitRi|pitRu|_vei1@1820|_vei1_pn526
<u>'''Pitṛ,'''</u> common from the Rigveda onwards, denotes ‘father,’ not so much as the ‘begetter’ (''[[जनितृ|janitṛ]]''),<ref name=fx1_ve1_1820/> but rather as the protector of the child, this being probably also the etymological sense of the word.<ref name=fx2_ve1_1820/> The father in the Rigveda<ref name=fx3_ve1_1820/> stands for all that is good and kind. Hence Agni is compared with a father,<ref name=fx4_ve1_1820/> while Indra is even dearer than a father.<ref name=fx5_ve1_1820/> The father carries his son in his arms,<ref name=fx6_ve1_1820/> and places him on his lap,<ref name=fx7_ve1_1820/> while the child pulls his garment to attract attention.<ref name=fx8_ve1_1820/> In later years the son depends on his father for help in trouble,<ref name=fx9_ve1_1820/> and greets him with joy.<ref name=fx10_ve1_1820/><br><br>It is difficult to ascertain precisely how far the son was subject to parental control, and how long such control continued. Reference is made in the Rigveda<ref name=fx11_ve1_1820/> to a father's chastising his son for gambling, and '''[[ऋज्राश्व|Ṛjrāśva]]''' is said to have been blinded by his father.<ref name=fx12_ve1_1820/> From the latter statement Zimmer<ref name=fx13_ve1_1820/> infers the existence of a developed ''patria potestas,'' but to lay stress on this isolated and semi-mythical incident would be unwise. It is, however, quite likely that the ''patria potestas'' was originally strong, for we have other support for the thesis in the Roman ''patria potestas.'' If there is no proof that a father  legally controlled his son's wedding,<ref name=fx14_ve1_1820/> and not much that he controlled his daughter's,<ref name=fx15_ve1_1820/> the fact is in itself not improbable.<br><br>There is again no evidence to show whether a son, when grown up, normally continued to stay with his father, his wife becoming a member of the father's household, or whether he set up a house of his own: probably the custom varied. Nor do we know whether the son was granted a special plot of land on marriage or otherwise, or whether he only came into such property after his father's death. But any excessive estimate of the father's powers over a son who was no longer a minor and naturally under his control, must be qualified by the fact that in his old age the sons might divide their father's property,<ref name=fx16_ve1_1820/> or he might divide it amongst them,<ref name=fx17_ve1_1820/> and that when the father-in-law became aged he fell under the control of his son's wife.<ref name=fx18_ve1_1820/> There are also obscure traces that in old age a father might be exposed, though there is no reason to suppose that this was usual in Vedic India.<ref name=fx19_ve1_1820/><br><br>Normally the son was bound to give his father full obedience.<ref name=fx20_ve1_1820/> The later Sūtras show in detail the acts of courtesy which he owed his father, and they allow him to eat the remnants of his father's food.<ref name=fx21_ve1_1820/> On the other hand, the father was expected to be kind. The story of '''[[शुनःशेप|Śunaḥśepa]]''' in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] Brāh-  maṇa<ref name=fx22_ve1_1820/> emphasizes the horror with which the father's heartless treatment of his son was viewed. The Upaniṣads<ref name=fx23_ve1_1820/> insist on the spiritual succession from father to son. The kissing of a son<ref name=fx24_ve1_1820/> was a frequent and usual token of affection, even in mature years.<br><br>On the failure of natural children, adoption was possible.<ref name=fx25_ve1_1820/> It was even resorted to when natural children existed, but when it was desired to secure the presence in the family of a person of specially high qualifications, as in Viśvāmitra's adoption of [[शुनःशेप|Śunaḥśepa]].<ref name=fx26_ve1_1820/> It is not clear that adoption from one caste into another was possible, for there is no good evidence that [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]] was, as Weber<ref name=fx27_ve1_1820/> holds, a [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] who adopted a [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]. Adoption was also not always in high favour: it may be accidental or not that a hymn of the [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] book of the Rigveda<ref name=fx28_ve1_1820/> condemns the usage. It was also possible for the father who had a daughter, but no sons, to appoint her to bear a son for him. At any rate the practice appears to be referred to in an obscure verse of the Rigveda<ref name=fx29_ve1_1820/> as interpreted by [[यास्क|Yāska]].<ref name=fx30_ve1_1820/> Moreover, it is possible that the difficulty of a brotherless maiden finding a husband<ref name=fx31_ve1_1820/> may have been due in part to the possibility of her father desiring to make her a [[पुत्रिका|Putrikā]], the later technical name for a daughter whose son is to belong to her father's family.<br><br>There can be no doubt that in a family the father took precedence of the mother.<ref name=fx32_ve1_1820/> Delbrück<ref name=fx33_ve1_1820/> explains away the apparent cases to the contrary.<ref name=fx34_ve1_1820/> There is no trace of the  family as a land-owning corporation.<ref name=fx35_ve1_1820/> The dual form Pitarau regularly means ‘father and mother,’ ‘parents.’<ref name=fx36_ve1_1820/><br>

Forts ‘with a hundred walls’ (''śatabhuji'') are spoken of.<ref name=fx7_ve1_1861/><br><br>It would probably be a mistake to regard these forts as premanently occupied fortified places like the fortresses of the mediæval barony.

<u>'''Puru-kutsa'''</u> is the name of a king who is mentioned several times in the Rigveda.

In two other passages<ref name=fx4_ve1_1868/> he is mentioned as victorious by divine favour, and in another<ref name=fx5_ve1_1868/> he appears as a king of the '''Pūrus''' and a conqueror of the '''Dāsas.''' His son was '''[[त्रसदस्यु|Trasadasyu]],'''<ref name=fx6_ve1_1868/> who is accordingly called '''Paurukutsya'''<ref name=fx7_ve1_1868/> or '''Paurukutsi.'''<ref name=fx8_ve1_1868/> Different conclusions have been drawn from one hymn of the Rigveda<ref name=fx9_ve1_1868/> in which the birth of Purukutsa's son,  [[त्रसदस्यु|Trasadasyu]], is mentioned. The usual interpretation is that [[पुरुकुत्स|Purukutsa]] was killed in battle or captured, whereupon his wife secured a son to restore the fortunes of the Pūrus. But Sieg<ref name=fx10_ve1_1868/> offers a completely different interpretation. According to him the word '''daurgahe,''' which occurs in the hymn, and which in the ordinary view is rendered ‘descendant of [[दुर्गह|Durgaha]],’ an ancestor of [[पुरुकुत्स|Purukutsa]], is the name of a horse, the hymn recording the success of an [[अश्वमेध|Aśvamedha]] (‘horse sacrifice’) undertaken by [[पुरुकुत्स|Purukutsa]] for his wife, as by kings in later times, to secure a son. This interpretation is supported by the version of ''daurgahe'' given in the Śatapatha,<ref name=fx11_ve1_1868/> but is by no means certain. Moreover, if [[पुरुकुत्स|Purukutsa]] was a contemporary of [[सुदास्|Sudās]], the defeat of the Pūrus by [[सुदास्|Sudās]] in the '''[[दाशराज्ञ|Dāśarājña]]'''<ref name=fx12_ve1_1868/> might well have been the cause of the troubles from which '''[[पुरुकुत्सानी|Purukutsānī]],''' by the birth of [[त्रसदस्यु|Trasadasyu]], rescued the family.

The legend, which also occurs in the Śāṭyāyanaka,<ref name=fx11_ve1_1875/> is apparently best explained by  Sieg,<ref name=fx12_ve1_1875/> who says that as the two were kings they could not under the rules of caste accept gifts, unless for the nonce they became singers.

In favour of this view, he cites the fact that [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] is mentioned both as [[पुरोहित|Purohita]]<ref name=fx27_ve2_14/> and as [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]]:<ref name=fx28_ve2_14/> at the sacrifice of '''[[शुनःशेप|Śunaḥśepa]]''' he served as [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]],<ref name=fx29_ve2_14/> but he was the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] of [[सुदास्|Sudās]];<ref name=fx30_ve2_14/> [[बृहस्पति|Bṛhaspati]] is called the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]]<ref name=fx31_ve2_14/> and the [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]]<ref name=fx32_ve2_14/> of the gods; and the Vasiṣṭhas who are Purohitas are also the Brahmans at the sacrifice.<ref name=fx33_ve2_14/> It is thus clear that the [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] was often the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]]; and it was natural that this should be the case when once the Brahman's place became, as it did in the later ritual, the most important position at the sacrifice.<ref name=fx34_ve2_14/> But the [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] can hardly be said to have held this place in the earlier ritual; Oldenberg<ref name=fx35_ve2_14/> seems to be right in holding that the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] was originally the [[होतृ|Hotṛ]] priest, the singer ''par excellence,'' when he took any part at all in the ritual of the great sacrifices with the '''Ṛtvijs.''' So Devāpi seems clearly to have  been a [[होतृ|Hotṛ]];<ref name=fx36_ve2_14/> Agni is at once [[पुरोहित|Purohita]]<ref name=fx37_ve2_14/> and [[होतृ|Hotṛ]];<ref name=fx38_ve2_14/> and the ‘two divine Hotṛs’ referred to in the Āprī litanies are also called the ‘two Purohitas.’<ref name=fx39_ve2_14/> Later, no doubt, when the priestly activity ceased to centre in the song, the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]], with his skill in magic, became the [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]], who also required magic to undo the errors of the sacrifice.<ref name=fx40_ve2_14/><br><br>There is little doubt that in the original growth of the priesthood the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] played a considerable part. In historical times he represented the real power of the kingship, and may safely be deemed to have exercised great influence in all public affairs, such as the administration of justice and the king's conduct of business. But it is not at all probable that the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] represents, as Roth<ref name=fx41_ve2_14/> and Zimmer<ref name=fx42_ve2_14/> thought, the source which gave rise to caste.

[[त्रासदस्यव|Trāsadasyava]], the patronymic of '''Kuruśravaṇa''' in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx10_ve2_30/> shows that the royal families of the Kurus and the Pūrus were allied by intermarriage.<br><br>Hillebrandt,<ref name=fx11_ve2_30/> admitting that the Pūrus in later times lived in the eastern country round the [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]], thinks that in earlier days they were to be found to the west of the Indus with '''Divodāsa.''' This theory must fall with the theory that Divodāsa was in the far west. It might, however, be held to be supported by the fact that Alexander found a --that is, a Paurava prince on the Hydaspes,<ref name=fx12_ve2_30/> a sort of half-way locality between the [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]] and the West. But it is quite simple to suppose either that the Hydaspes was the earlier home of the Pūrus, where some remained after the others had  wandered east, or that the later Paurava represents a successful onslaught upon the west from the east.<br><br>In several other passages of the Rigveda<ref name=fx13_ve2_30/> the Pūrus as a people seem to be meant. The [[निरुक्त|Nirukta]]<ref name=fx14_ve2_30/> recognizes the general sense of ‘man,’ but in no passage is this really necessary or even probable. So utterly, however, is the tradition lost that the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx15_ve2_30/> explains [[पूरु|Pūru]] in the Rigveda<ref name=fx16_ve2_30/> as an Asura [[रक्षस्|Rakṣas]]; it is only in the Epic that [[पूरु|Pūru]] revives as the name of a son of [[ययाति|Yayāti]] and Śarmiṣṭhā.<ref name=fx17_ve2_30/><br>

The animal also occurs in the list of victims at the [[अश्वमेध|Aśvamedha]] (‘horse sacrifice’) in the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]] Saṃhitās,<ref name=fx5_ve2_64/> and occasionally elsewhere.<ref name=fx6_ve2_64/> It appears to be the ‘ram’ or the ‘wether,’ the latter<ref name=fx7_ve2_64/> being the sense given to it by the commentator on the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā. But there is no conclusive evidence in favour of this meaning, while on the whole the passage of the Atharvaveda, in which ''[[वाज|vāja]]'' is found, accords best with the sense of ‘ram.’ Hopkins,<ref name=fx8_ve2_64/> however, renders the word as ‘goat,’ though for what reason is not clear.

In the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx2_ve2_106/> he appears as arriving at the sacrifice of the [[ऋषिस्|Ṛṣis]] in the Naimiṣa forest, and asking them how errors in the sacrifice could be remedied; and as finding '''Alīkayu Vācaspata,''' the [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] priest at the sacrifice, unable to say what was to be  done. In the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]]<ref name=fx3_ve2_106/> it is said that [[प्रतर्दन|Pratardana]] [[दैवोदासि|Daivodāsi]] went to Indra's world through his death in battle. The patronymic connects him with '''Divodāsa,''' the ancestor or father of '''[[सुदास्|Sudās]],''' and the mention of [[भरद्वाज|Bharadvāja]] (probably ‘a Bharadvāja’ is meant) as his priest supports the patronymic, for Divodāsa is a special favourite of the singers of the [[भरद्वाज|Bharadvāja]] family. The name, moreover, is reminiscent of the Tṛtsus (the root ''tard'' appears in both) and of the ''Pratṛdaḥ'' (see '''[[प्रतृद्|Pratṛd]]'''). But he is not in Vedic literature a king of [[काशि|Kāśi]].<ref name=fx4_ve2_106/> Geldner<ref name=fx5_ve2_106/> regards him as Divodāsa's son, but this is not likely. ''Cf.''

प्रष्टि|praṣṭi|praShTi|ప్రష్టి|ಪ್ರಷ್ಟಿ|_vei2@166|_vei2_pn42

<u>'''Bali'''</u> occurs several times in the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve2_270/> and often later<ref name=fx2_ve2_270/> in the sense of tribute to a king or offering to a god. Zimmer<ref name=fx3_ve2_270/> thinks that the offerings were in both cases voluntary. He compares the notices of the Germans in Tacitus,<ref name=fx4_ve2_270/> where the kings of the tribes are said to receive gifts in kind as presents, but not a regular tribute. There seems to be no ground whatever for this view. No doubt in origin the prerogatives of monarchy were due to voluntary action on the part of the tribesmen,<ref name=fx5_ve2_270/> but that the Vedic peoples, who were essentially a body of conquering invaders, were in this state is most improbable, and the attitude of the Vedic Indian to his gods was at least as compatible with tribute as with voluntary gifts.

But the view of Roth<ref name=fx3_ve2_273/> and Weber,<ref name=fx4_ve2_273/> which Zimmer<ref name=fx5_ve2_273/> once accepted, that an Iranian tribe is referred to (''cf.''

<u>'''2.

The epithet [[प्रातिपीय|Prātipīya]] is curious: if it connects him with '''Pratīpa''' (whose son he is in the Epic), the form is remarkable, Zimmer<ref name=fx2_ve2_274/> indeed tacitly altering it to Prātīpīya. In the Epic and the Purāṇas<ref name=fx3_ve2_274/> he is in the form of Vāhlīka made a brother of '''Devāpi''' and '''Śantanu,''' and a son of Pratīpa. To base chronological conclusions on this<ref name=fx4_ve2_274/> would be utterly misleading, for the facts are that Devāpi was son of [[ऋष्टिषेण|Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa]] and a priest, while Śantanu was a Kuru prince of unknown parentage, but not probably a son of Pratīpa, who seems to be a late figure in the Vedic age, later than '''[[परिक्षित्|Parikṣit]],''' being his great-grandson in the Epic. Very possibly [[बल्हिक|Balhika]] was a descendant of Pratīpa. Why he bore the name [[बल्हिक|Balhika]] must remain uncertain, for there is no evidence of any sort regarding it.<br>

The youth is initiated (''upa-nī'') by the teacher<ref name=fx4_ve2_330/> into a new life; he wears an antelope skin, and lets his hair grow long;<ref name=fx5_ve2_330/> he collects fuel,<ref name=fx6_ve2_330/> and begs,<ref name=fx7_ve2_330/> learns, and practises penance.

No doubt individuals of the '''[[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]]''' or '''[[वैश्य|Vaiśya]]''' caste might go through part of the period of studentship, just as Burmese boys of all classes now pass some time in a monastery as students. This is borne out by the reference in the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx17_ve2_330/> to the king guarding his country by [[ब्रह्मचर्य|Brahmacarya]]--though that is susceptible of a different interpretation--and more clearly by the reference in the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx18_ve2_330/> to a rite intended to benefit one who, although not a Brahmin, had studied (''vidyām anūcya''), but had not gained renown, and by references in the Upaniṣads to kings who like '''[[जनक|Janaka]]''' studied the Vedas and the Upaniṣads.<ref name=fx19_ve2_330/> Normally, however, the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] studied the art of war.<ref name=fx20_ve2_330/><br><br>One of the duties of the Brahmacārin was chastity.

<u>'''2. Brahman'''</u> is found in many passages of the Rigveda and later in the sense of ‘priest.’ In many passages of the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve2_334/> he is referred to as praising the gods; in others<ref name=fx2_ve2_334/> the sense of ‘priest’ is adequate. In not a few cases<ref name=fx3_ve2_334/> the priesthood as a profession is clearly alluded to, nor is there any reason to doubt<ref name=fx4_ve2_334/> that in all cases the word has the technical sense of a member of the priesthood. There is, however, considerable doubt as to the number of cases in the Rigveda, where it has the technical  sense of the priest who guides the sacrifice generally. It is undoubtedly found in that sense, both Muir<ref name=fx5_ve2_334/> and Roth<ref name=fx6_ve2_334/> recognizing instances of its being used thus. Geldner,<ref name=fx7_ve2_334/> however, is anxious to find that sense in a large number of passages, and insists that the '''[[पुरोहित|Purohita]]''' was normally a [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] in the narrower sense. Oldenberg,<ref name=fx8_ve2_334/> on the other hand, holds with greater probability that in most of the passages adduced [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] means simply ‘priest,’ and that the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]], who was essentially not a member of the ordinary body of sacrificing priests ('''[[ऋत्व्इज्|Ṛtvij]]'''), was, when he officiated at the sacrifice, more usually the [[होतृ|Hotṛ]] priest, and only later became the [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]]. This change he regards as having taken place when the importance of the hymns declined, and most weight was laid on the functions of the priest who superintended the sacrifice as a whole, and by his magic repaired the flaws in the sacrifice.<ref name=fx9_ve2_334/> In the later literature both senses of the word are quite common.<ref name=fx10_ve2_334/><br>

<u>'''1. Brāhmaṇa,'''</u> ‘descendant of a Brahman’ (''i.e.,'' of a priest), is found only a few times in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx1_ve2_348/> and mostly in its latest  parts. In the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx2_ve2_348/> and later<ref name=fx3_ve2_348/> it is a very common word denoting ‘priest,’ and it appears in the quadruple division of the castes in the [[पुरुष|Puruṣa]]-[[सूक्त|sūkta]] (‘hymn of man’) of the Rigveda.<ref name=fx4_ve2_348/><br><br>It seems certain that in the Rigveda this [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], or Brahmin, is already a separate caste, differing from the warrior and agricultural castes.<ref name=fx5_ve2_348/> The texts regularly claim for them a superiority to the '''[[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]]''' caste,<ref name=fx6_ve2_348/> and the Brahmin is able by his spells or manipulation of the rite to embroil the people and the warriors<ref name=fx7_ve2_348/> or the different sections of the warriors.<ref name=fx8_ve2_348/> If it is necessary to recognize, as is sometimes done, that the Brahmin does pay homage to the king at the '''[[राजसूय|Rājasūya]],'''<ref name=fx9_ve2_348/> nevertheless the unusual fact is carefully explained away so as to leave the priority of the Brahmin unaffected. But it is expressly recognized that the union of the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] and the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] is essential for complete prosperity.<ref name=fx10_ve2_348/> It is admitted<ref name=fx11_ve2_348/> that the king or the nobles might at times oppress the Brahmins, but it is indicated that ruin is then certain swiftly to follow. <br><br>The Brahmins are gods on earth,<ref name=fx12_ve2_348/> like the gods in heaven, but this claim is hardly found in the Rigveda.<ref name=fx13_ve2_348/><br><br>In the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx14_ve2_348/> the Brahmin is said to be the ‘recipient of gifts’ (''ādāyī'') and the ‘drinker of the offering’ (''āpāyī''). The other two epithets applied, ''āvasāyī'' and ''yathākāma-prayāpya,'' are more obscure; the former denotes either ‘dwelling everywhere’<ref name=fx15_ve2_348/> or ‘seeking food’;<ref name=fx16_ve2_348/> the latter is usually taken as ‘moving at pleasure,’ but it must rather allude to the power of the king to assign a place of residence to the Brahmin.<br><br>In the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx17_ve2_348/> the prerogatives of the Brahmin are summed up as (1) [[अर्चा|Arcā]], ‘honour’; (2) [[दान|Dāna]], ‘gifts’; (3) [[अज्येयता|Ajyeyatā]], ‘freedom from oppression’; and (4) [[अवध्यता|Avadhyatā]], ‘freedom from being killed.’ On the other hand, his duties are summed up as (5) Brāhmaṇya, ‘purity of descent’; (6) Pratirūpa-caryā, ‘devotion of the duties of his caste’; and (7) Loka-[[पक्ति|pakti]], ‘the perfecting of people’ (by teaching).<br><br>1. ''Respect paid to Brahmins.''--The texts are full<ref name=fx18_ve2_348/> of references to the civilities to be paid to the Brahmin. He is styled ''bhagavant,''<ref name=fx19_ve2_348/> and is provided with good food<ref name=fx20_ve2_348/> and entertainment wherever he goes. Indeed, his sanctity exempts him from any close inquiry into his real claim to Brahminhood according to the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx21_ve2_348/><br><br>2. ''Gifts to Brahmins.''--The Dānastuti (‘Praise of gifts’) is a recognized feature of the Rigveda, and the greed of the poets for '''Dakṣiṇās,''' or sacrificial fees, is notorious. Vedic texts<ref name=fx22_ve2_348/> themselves recognize that the literature thence resulting ('''Nārā-  śaṃsī''') was often false to please the donors. It was, however, a rule<ref name=fx23_ve2_348/> that Brahmins should not accept what had been refused by others; this indicates a keen sense of the danger of cheapening their wares. So exclusively theirs was the right to receive gifts that the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx24_ve2_348/> has to explain how '''[[तरन्त|Taranta]]''' and '''[[पुरुमीळ्ह|Purumīḷha]]''' became able to accept gifts by composing a Rigvedic hymn.<ref name=fx25_ve2_348/> The exaggerations in the celebration of the gifts bestowed on the priests has the curious result of giving us a series of numerals of some interest ('''[[दशन्|Daśan]]'''). In some passages<ref name=fx26_ve2_348/> certain gifts--those of a horse or sheep--are forbidden, but this rule was not, it is clear, generally observed.<br><br>3. ''Immunities of Brahmins.''--The Brahmin claimed to be exempt from the ordinary exercise of the royal power. When a king gives all his land and what is on it to the priests, the gift does not cover the property of the Brahmin according to the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx27_ve2_348/> The king censures all, but not the Brahmin,<ref name=fx28_ve2_348/> nor can he safely oppress any Brahmin other than an ignorant priest.<ref name=fx29_ve2_348/> An arbitrator (or a witness) must decide (or speak) for a Brahmin against a non-Brahmin in a legal dispute.<ref name=fx30_ve2_348/><br><br>The Brahmin's proper food is the '''Soma,'''<ref name=fx31_ve2_348/> not '''[[सुरा|Surā]]'''<ref name=fx32_ve2_348/> or '''[[परिस्रुत्|Parisrut]],'''<ref name=fx33_ve2_348/> and he is forbidden to eat certain forms of flesh.<ref name=fx34_ve2_348/> On the other hand, he alone is allowed to eat the remains of the sacrifice,<ref name=fx35_ve2_348/> for no one else is sufficiently holy to consume food which the gods have eaten. Moreover, though he cannot be a physician,<ref name=fx36_ve2_348/> he helps the physician by being beside him  while he exercises his art.<ref name=fx37_ve2_348/> His wife<ref name=fx38_ve2_348/> and his cow<ref name=fx39_ve2_348/> are both sacred.<br><br>4. ''Legal Position of Brahmins.''--The [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx40_ve2_348/> lays down a penalty of a hundred (the unit meant is unknown) for an insult to a Brahmin, and of a thousand for a blow; but if his blood is drawn, the penalty is a spiritual one. The only real murder is the slaying of a Brahmin according to the Satapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx41_ve2_348/> The crime of slaying a Brahmin ranks above the sin of killing any other man, but below that of killing an embryo (''bhrūṇa'') in the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]];<ref name=fx42_ve2_348/> the crime of slaying an embryo whose sex is uncertain is on a level with that of slaying a Brahmin.<ref name=fx43_ve2_348/> The murder of a Brahmin can be expiated only by the horse sacrifice,<ref name=fx44_ve2_348/> or by a lesser rite in the late [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Āraṇyaka.<ref name=fx45_ve2_348/> The ritual slaying of a Brahmin is allowed in the later ceremonial,<ref name=fx46_ve2_348/> and hinted at in the curious legend of '''[[शुनःशेप|Śunaḥśepa]];'''<ref name=fx47_ve2_348/> and a [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] might be punished with death for treachery to his master.<ref name=fx48_ve2_348/><br><br>5. ''Purity of Birth.''--The importance of pure descent is seen in the stress laid on being a descendant of a [[ऋषि|Ṛṣi]] (''ārṣeya'').<ref name=fx49_ve2_348/> But, on the other hand, there are clear traces of another doctrine, which requires learning, and not physical descent, as the true criterion of Ṛṣihood.<ref name=fx50_ve2_348/> In agreement with this is the fact that '''[[सत्यकाम|Satyakāma]] [[जाबाल|Jābāla]]''' was received as a pupil, though his parentage was unknown, his mother being a slave girl who had been connected with several men,<ref name=fx51_ve2_348/> and that in the Śatapatha  [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx52_ve2_348/> the ceremony on acceptance as a pupil required merely the name of the pupil. So '''[[कवष|Kavaṣa]]''' is taunted in the Rigveda Brāhmaṇas<ref name=fx53_ve2_348/> as being the son of a female slave ('''Dāsī'''), and '''[[वत्स|Vatsa]]''' cleared himself of a similar imputation by a fire ordeal.<ref name=fx54_ve2_348/> Moreover, a very simple rite was adequate to remove doubts as to origin.<ref name=fx55_ve2_348/> In these circumstances it is doubtful whether much value attaches to the '''[[प्रवर|Pravara]]''' lists in which the ancestors of the priest were invoked at the beginning of the sacrifice by the [[होतृ|Hotṛ]] and the [[अध्वर्यु|Adhvaryu]] priests.<ref name=fx56_ve2_348/> Still, in many parts of the ritual the knowledge of two or more generations was needed,<ref name=fx57_ve2_348/> and in one ceremony<ref name=fx58_ve2_348/> ten ancestors who have drunk the Soma are required, but a literal performance of the rite is excused. Moreover, there are clear traces of ritual variations in schools, like those of the '''Vasiṣṭhas''' and the '''Viśvāmitras.'''<br><br>6. ''The Conduct of the Brahmin.''--The Brahmin was required to maintain a fair standard of excellence.<ref name=fx59_ve2_348/> He was to be kind to all<ref name=fx60_ve2_348/> and gentle,<ref name=fx61_ve2_348/> offering sacrifice and receiving gifts.<ref name=fx62_ve2_348/> Especial stress was laid on purity of speech;<ref name=fx63_ve2_348/> thus '''Viśvantara's''' excuse for excluding the '''Śyāparṇas''' from his retinue was their impure (''apūtā'') speech.<ref name=fx64_ve2_348/> Theirs was the craving for knowledge<ref name=fx65_ve2_348/> and the life of begging.<ref name=fx66_ve2_348/> False Brahmins are those who do not fulfil their duties<ref name=fx67_ve2_348/> (''cf.'' '''[[ब्रह्मबन्धु|Brahmabandhu]]''') .  But the penances for breach of duty are, in the Sūtras, of a very light and unimportant character.<ref name=fx68_ve2_348/><br><br>7.

''The Functions of the Brahmin.''--The Brahmin was required not merely to practise individual culture, but also to give others the advantage of his skill, either as a teacher or as a sacrificial priest, or as a [[पुरोहित|Purohita]].<br><br>As a teacher the Brahmin has, of course, the special duty of instructing his own son in both study and sacrificial ritual.<ref name=fx96_ve2_348/> The texts give examples of this, such as [[आरुणि|Āruṇi]] and '''[[श्वेतकेतु|Śvetaketu]],'''<ref name=fx97_ve2_348/> or mythically Varuṇa and [[भृगु|Bhṛgu]].<ref name=fx98_ve2_348/> This fact also appears from some of the names in the [[वंश|Vaṃśa]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx99_ve2_348/> of the [[सामवेद|Sāmaveda]] and the [[वंश|Vaṃśa]] (list of teachers) of the [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Āraṇyaka.<ref name=fx100_ve2_348/> On the other hand, these Vaṃśas and the Vaṃśas of the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] show that a father often preferred to let his son study under a famous teacher. The relation of pupil and teacher is described under '''[[ब्रह्मचर्य|Brahmacarya]].''' A teacher might take several pupils,<ref name=fx101_ve2_348/> and he was bound to teach them with all his heart and soul.<ref name=fx102_ve2_348/> He was bound to reveal everything to his pupil, at any rate to one who was staying with him for a year (''[[संवत्सर|saṃvatsara]]-vāsin''),<ref name=fx103_ve2_348/> an expression which shows, as was natural, that a pupil might easily change teachers. But, nevertheless, certain cases of learning kept secret and only revealed to special persons are enumerated.<ref name=fx104_ve2_348/> The exact times and modes of teaching are elaborately laid down in the Sūtras,<ref name=fx105_ve2_348/> but not in the earlier texts.<br><br>As priest the Brahmin operated in all the greater sacrifices; the simple domestic (''[[गृह्य|gṛhya]]'') rites could normally be performed without his help, but not the more important rites (''śrauta'').  The number varied: the ritual literature requires sixteen priests to be employed at the greatest sacrifices (see '''[[ऋत्व्इज्|Ṛtvij]]'''), but other rites could be accomplished with four,<ref name=fx106_ve2_348/> five,<ref name=fx107_ve2_348/> six,<ref name=fx108_ve2_348/> seven,<ref name=fx109_ve2_348/> or ten<ref name=fx110_ve2_348/> priests. Again, the Kauṣītakins<ref name=fx111_ve2_348/> had a seventeenth priest beside the usual sixteen, the [[सदस्य|Sadasya]], so called because he watched the performance from the [[सदस्|Sadas]], ‘seat.’ In one rite, the Sattra (‘sacrificial session’) of the serpents, the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx112_ve2_348/> adds three more to the sixteen, a second Unnetṛ, an Abhigara, and an Apagara. The later ritual places the [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] at the head of all the priests, but this is probably not the early view (see '''[[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]]''').<br><br>The sacrifice ensured, if properly performed, primarily the advantages of the sacrificer (''yajamāna''),<ref name=fx113_ve2_348/> but the priest shared in the profit, besides securing the '''Dakṣiṇās.''' Disputes between sacrificers and the priests were not rare, as in the case of '''Viśvantara''' and the '''Śyāparṇas,'''<ref name=fx114_ve2_348/> or '''[[जनम्एजय|Janamejaya]]''' and the '''Asitamṛgas;'''<ref name=fx115_ve2_348/> and the '''Aiṣāvīras''' are referred to as undersirable priests.<ref name=fx116_ve2_348/> Moreover, '''[[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]]''' once held the post of [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] to '''[[सुदास्|Sudās]],''' but gave place to '''[[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]].''' <br><br>The position of '''[[पुरोहित|Purohita]]''' differed considerably from that of the ordinary priest, for the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] not merely might officiate at the sacrifice, but was the officiator in all the private sacrifices of his king. Hence he could, and undoubtedly sometimes did, obtain great influence over his master in matters of secular importance; and the power of the priesthood in political as opposed to domestic and religious matters, no doubt rested on the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]].<br><br>There is no recognition in Vedic literature of the rule later prevailing by which, after spending part of his life as a Brahmacārin, and part as a householder, the Brahmin became an ascetic<ref name=fx117_ve2_348/> (later divided into the two stages of Vānaprastha, ‘forest-dweller,’ and Saṃnyāsin, ‘mystic’). Yājñavalkya's case<ref name=fx118_ve2_348/> shows that study of the Absolute might empty life of all its content for the sage, and drive him to abandon wife and family. In Buddhist times the same phenomenon is seen<ref name=fx119_ve2_348/> applying to other than Brahmins. The Buddhist texts are here confirmed in some degree by the Greek authorities.<ref name=fx120_ve2_348/> The practice bears a certain resemblance to the habit of kings, in the Epic tradition,<ref name=fx121_ve2_348/> of retiring to the forest when active life is over.<br><br>From the Greek authorities<ref name=fx122_ve2_348/> it also appears--what is certainly the case in the Buddhist literature<ref name=fx123_ve2_348/> --that Brahmins practised the most diverse occupations. It is difficult to say how far this was true for the Vedic period. The analogy of the Druids<ref name=fx124_ve2_348/> --in some respects very close--suggests that the Brahmins may have been mainly confined to their professional tasks, including all the learned professions such as astronomy<ref name=fx125_ve2_348/>  and so forth. This is not contradicted by any Vedic evidence, for instance, the poet of a hymn of the Rigveda<ref name=fx126_ve2_348/> says he is a poet, his father a physician ('''[[भिषज्|Bhiṣaj]]'''), and his mother a grinder of corn ('''[[उपल-प्रक्षिणी|Upala-prakṣiṇī]]'''). This would seem to show that a Brahmin could be a doctor, while his wife would perform the ordinary household duties. So a [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] could perhaps take the field to assist the king by prayer, as [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]],<ref name=fx127_ve2_348/> and later on [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]]<ref name=fx128_ve2_348/> do, but this does not show that priests normally fought. Nor do they seem normally to have been agriculturists or merchants. On the other hand, they kept cattle: a Brahmacārin's duty was to watch his master's cattle.<ref name=fx129_ve2_348/> It is therefore needless to suppose that they could not, and did not, on occasion turn to agricultural or mercantile pursuits, as they certainly did later. But it must be remembered that in all probability there was more purity of blood, and less pressure of life, among the Brahmins of the Vedic age than later in Buddhist times, when the Vedic sacrificial apparatus was falling into grave disrepute.<br><br>It is clear that the Brahmins, whatever their defects, represented the intellectual side of Vedic life, and that the Kṣatriyas, if they played a part in that life, did so only in a secondary degree, and to a minor extent. It is natural to suppose that the Brahmins also composed ballads, the precursors of the epic; for though none such have survived, a few stanzas of this character, celebrating the generosity of patrons, have been preserved by being embedded in priestly compositions. A legend in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx130_ve2_348/> shows clearly that the Brahmins regarded civilization as being spread by them only:  '''[[कोसल|Kosala]]''' and '''[[विदेह|Videha]],''' no doubt settled by Āryan tribes, are only rendered civilized and habitable by the influence of pious Brahmins. We need not doubt that the non-Brahminical tribes (see '''[[व्रात्य|Vrātya]]''') had attained intellectual as well as material civilization, but it is reasonable to assume that their civilization was inferior to that of the Brahmins, for the history of Hinduism is the conquest by the Brahmins--not by arms, but by mind--of the tribes Āryan and non-Āryan originally beyond the pale.<br>

भरत|bharata|భరత|ಭರತ|_vei2@364|_vei2_pn94
<u>'''Bharata'''</u> is the name of a people of great importance in the Rigveda and the later literature. In the Rigveda they appear prominently in the third and seventh Maṇḍalas in connexion  with '''[[सुदास्|Sudās]]''' and the '''Tṛtsus,'''<ref name=fx1_ve2_364/> while in the sixth Maṇḍala they are associated with '''Divodāsa.'''<ref name=fx2_ve2_364/> In one passage<ref name=fx3_ve2_364/> the Bharatas are, like the Tṛtsus, enemies of the '''Pūrus:''' there can be little doubt that Ludwig's view of the identity of the Bharatas and and Tṛtsus is practically correct. More precisely Oldenberg<ref name=fx5_ve2_364/> considers that the Tṛtsus are the '''Vasiṣṭhas,''' the family singers of the Bharatas; while Geldner<ref name=fx6_ve2_364/> recognizes, with perhaps more probability, in the Tṛtsus the royal family of the Bharatas. That the Tṛtsus and Bharatas were enemies, as Zimmer<ref name=fx7_ve2_364/> holds, is most improbable even on geographical grounds, for the Tṛtsus in Zimmer's view<ref name=fx8_ve2_364/> occupied the country to the east of the '''[[परुष्णी|Paruṣṇī]]''' (Ravi), and the Bharatas must therefore be regarded as coming against the Tṛtsus from the west, whereas the Rigveda<ref name=fx9_ve2_364/> recognizes two [[भरत|Bharata]] chiefs on the '''[[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]], [[आपया|Āpayā]],''' and '''[[दृषद्वती|Dṛṣadvatī]]'''--that is, in the holy land of India, the '''[[मध्यदेश|Madhyadeśa]].''' Hillebrandt<ref name=fx10_ve2_364/> sees in the connexion of the Tṛtsus and the Bharatas a fusion of two tribes; but this is not supported by any evidence beyond the fact that in his opinion some such theory is needed to explain Divodāsa's appearing in connexion with the '''[[भरद्वाज|Bharadvāja]]''' family, while [[सुदास्|Sudās]], his son,<br><br>^4 Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 172 ''et seq.''  or perhaps grandson (''cf.'' '''[[पिजवन|Pijavana]]'''), is connected with the Vasiṣṭhas and the '''Viśvāmitras.'''<br><br>In the later literature the Bharatas appear as especially famous. The Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx11_ve2_364/> mentions [[भरत|Bharata]] [[दौःषन्ति|Dauḥṣanti]] as a king, sacrificer of the [[अश्वमेध|Aśvamedha]] (‘horse sacrifice’) and '''[[शतानीक सात्राजित|Śatānīka Sātrājita]],''' as another [[भरत|Bharata]] who offered that sacrifice. The [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx12_ve2_364/> mentions [[भरत|Bharata]] [[दौःषन्ति|Dauḥṣanti]] as receiving the kingly coronation from '''[[दीर्घतमस्|Dīrghatamas]] [[मामतेय|Māmateya]],''' and Śatānīka as being consecrated by '''[[सोमशुष्मन् वाजरत्नायन|Somaśuṣman Vājaratnāyana]],''' a priest whose name is of quite late origin. The geographical position of the [[भरत|Bharata]] people is clearly shown by the fact that the [[भरत|Bharata]] kings win victories over the '''Kāśis,''' and make offerings on the '''[[यमुना|Yamunā]]''' (Jumna) and '''[[गङ्गा|Gaṅgā]]''' (Ganges).<ref name=fx13_ve2_364/> Moreover, in the formula of the king's proclamation for the people, the variants recorded<ref name=fx14_ve2_364/> include ''Kuravaḥ, Pañcālāḥ, Kuru-Pañcālāḥ,'' and ''Bharatāḥ;'' and the Mahābhārata consistently recognizes the royal family of the '''Kurus''' as a [[भरत|Bharata]] family.<ref name=fx15_ve2_364/> It is therefore extremely probable that Oldenberg<ref name=fx16_ve2_364/> is right in holding that the Bharatas in the times of the Brāhmaṇas were merging in the Kuru-[[पञ्चाल|Pañcāla]] people.<br><br>The ritual practices of the Bharatas are repeatedly mentioned in the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx17_ve2_364/> the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx18_ve2_364/> the  Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx19_ve2_364/> and the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Āraṇyaka.<ref name=fx20_ve2_364/> Already in the Rigveda<ref name=fx21_ve2_364/> there is mention made of Agni [[भारत|Bhārata]] (‘of the Bharatas’). In the Āprī hymns<ref name=fx22_ve2_364/> occurs a goddess Bhāratī, the personified divine protective power of the Bharatas: her association in the hymns with [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]] reflects the connexion of the Bharatas with the [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]] in the Rigveda.<ref name=fx9_ve2_364/> Again, in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx23_ve2_364/> Agni is referred to as ''[[ब्राह्मण|brāhmaṇa]] [[भारत|Bhārata]],'' ‘priest of the Bharatas,’ and is invited to dispose of the offering ''Manuṣvat Bharatavat,'' ‘like Manu,’ ‘like [[भरत|Bharata]].’<ref name=fx24_ve2_364/><br><br>In one or two passages<ref name=fx25_ve2_364/> [[सुदास्|Sudās]] or Divodāsa and, on the other hand, [[पुरुकुत्स|Purukutsa]] or [[त्रसदस्यु|Trasadasyu]] appear in a friendly relation. Possibly this points, as Oldenberg<ref name=fx26_ve2_364/> suggests, to the union of Bharatas and Pūrus with the Kurus.<br><br>A [[भरत|Bharata]] is referred to in the fifth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda:<ref name=fx27_ve2_364/> who he was is uncertain.<br>

<u>'''Bharad-vāja'''</u> is the name of the reputed<ref name=fx1_ve2_365/> author of the sixth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda. The attribution is so far correct that [[भरद्वाज|Bharadvāja]]<ref name=fx2_ve2_365/> and the Bharadvājas<ref name=fx3_ve2_365/> are repeatedly mentioned as singers in that Maṇḍala. Judging by the tone of the references to [[भरद्वाज|Bharadvāja]], he can hardly be deemed to have been a contemporary of any of the hymns.<ref name=fx4_ve2_365/> According to the Pañcaviṃśa  [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx5_ve2_365/> he was the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] of '''Divodāsa.''' This interpretation is to be preferred to that of Roth,<ref name=fx6_ve2_365/> who suggests that he and Divodāsa were identical. His connexion with the house of Divodāsa also appears from the statement of the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx7_ve2_365/> that [[भरद्वाज|Bharadvāja]] gave '''[[प्रतर्दन|Pratardana]]''' the kingdom. It is unnecessary to suppose that the same [[भरद्वाज|Bharadvāja]] was meant in both cases, and that [[प्रतर्दन|Pratardana]] was a son of Divodāsa: the later Saṃhitās refer to [[भरद्वाज|Bharadvāja]], like the other great sages, irrespective of chronology.<br><br>The Bharadvājas in their poems mention '''[[बृबु|Bṛbu]], [[बृसय|Bṛsaya]],''' and the '''Pārāvatas.'''<ref name=fx8_ve2_365/> Hillebrandt<ref name=fx9_ve2_365/> has pointed out that they are also connected with the '''Sṛñjayas.''' In particular, the [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx10_ve2_365/> mentions that [[भरद्वाज|Bharadvāja]] gained largesse from '''[[प्रस्तोक|Prastoka]] [[सार्ञ्जय|Sārñjaya]]''' and [[बृबु|Bṛbu]].

The derivation from the root ''bhṛ,'' ‘support,’ is probably correct, designating the brother as the support of his sister. This harmonizes with the fact that in Vedic literature the brother plays the part of protector of his sister when bereft of her father, and that maidens deprived of their brothers (''abhrātṛ'') meet an evil fate.<ref name=fx4_ve2_433/> The gradation of the relations in the home is shown by the order in the Chāndogya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]],<ref name=fx5_ve2_433/> where father, mother, brother, and sister are successively mentioned. Strife between brothers is occasionally referred to.<ref name=fx6_ve2_433/> <br>

<u>'''Bhrātṛvya'''</u> is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx1_ve2_434/> where, being named with brother and sister, it must be an expression of relationship. The sense appears to be ‘(father's) brother's son,’ ‘cousin,’<ref name=fx2_ve2_434/> this meaning alone accounting for the sense of ‘rival,’ ‘enemy,’ found elsewhere in the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx3_ve2_434/> and repeatedly in the other Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.<ref name=fx4_ve2_434/> In an undivided family the relations of cousins would easily develop into rivalry and enmity. The original meaning may, however, have been ‘nephew,’<ref name=fx5_ve2_434/> as the simple etymological sense would be ‘brother's son’; but this seems not to account for the later meaning so well. The [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx6_ve2_434/> prescribes the telling of a falsehood to a [[भ्रातृव्य|Bhrātṛvya]], who, further, is often given the epithets ‘hating’ (''dviṣan'') and ‘evil’ (''apriya, pāpman'') in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.<ref name=fx7_ve2_434/> The Atharvaveda<ref name=fx8_ve2_434/> also contains various spells, which aim at destroying or expelling one's ‘rivals.’<br>

मगध|magadha|మగధ|ಮಗಧ|_vei2@441|_vei2_pn116

Again, in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]],<ref name=fx3_ve2_441/> the [[मागध|Māgadha]], or man of [[मगध|Magadha]], is included as dedicated to ''ati-kruṣṭa,'' ‘loud noise’(?), while in the '''[[व्रात्य|Vrātya]]''' hymn of the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx4_ve2_441/> the [[मागध|Māgadha]] is said to be connected with the [[व्रात्य|Vrātya]] as his [[मित्र|Mitra]], his [[मन्त्र|Mantra]], his laughter, and his thunder in the four quarters. In the Śrauta Sūtras<ref name=fx5_ve2_441/> the equipment characteristic of the [[व्रात्य|Vrātya]] is said to be given, when the latter is admitted into the Āryan Brahminical community, to a bad Brahmin living in [[मगध|Magadha]] (''[[ब्रह्म-बन्धु|brahma-bandhu]] [[मागध-देशीय|Māgadha-deśīya]]''), but this point does not occur in the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx6_ve2_441/> On the other hand, respectable Brahmins sometimes lived there, for the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] Āraṇyaka<ref name=fx7_ve2_441/> mentions '''Madhyama, Prātībodhī-[[पुत्र|putra]],''' as ''[[मगध|Magadha]]-vāsin,'' ‘living in [[मगध|Magadha]].’ Oldenberg,<ref name=fx8_ve2_441/> however, seems clearly right in regarding this as unusual. <br><br>The Magadhas are evidently a people in the [[बौधायन|Baudhāyana]] and other Sūtras,<ref name=fx9_ve2_441/> possibly also in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] Āraṇyaka.<ref name=fx10_ve2_441/> It is therefore most improbable that Zimmer<ref name=fx11_ve2_441/> can be right in thinking that in the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]]<ref name=fx3_ve2_441/> and the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx4_ve2_441/> the [[मागध|Māgadha]] is not a man of [[मगध|Magadha]], but a member of the mixed caste produced by a '''[[वैश्य|Vaiśya]]''' marrying a '''[[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]]''' woman.<ref name=fx12_ve2_441/> But the theory of mixed castes, in any case open to some doubt, cannot be accepted when used to explain such obviously tribal names as [[मागध|Māgadha]]. The fact that the [[मागध|Māgadha]] is often in later times a minstrel is easily accounted for by the assumption that the country was the home of minstrelsy and that wandering bards from [[मगध|Magadha]] were apt to visit the more western lands. This class the later texts recognize as a caste, inventing an origin by intermarriage of the old-established castes.<br><br>The dislike of the Magadhas, which may be Rigvedic, since the '''Kīkaṭas''' were perhaps the prototype of the Magadhas, was in all probability due, as Oldenberg<ref name=fx13_ve2_441/> thinks, to the fact that the Magadhas were not really Brahminized. This is entirely in accord with the evidence of the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx14_ve2_441/> that neither '''[[कोसल|Kosala]]''' nor '''[[विदेह|Videha]]''' were fully Brahminized at an early date, much less [[मगध|Magadha]]. Weber<ref name=fx15_ve2_441/> suggests two other grounds that may have influenced the position--the persistence of aboriginal blood and the growth of Buddhism. The latter consideration is hardly applicable to the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]] or the Atharvaveda; but the imperfect Brahminization of the land, if substituted for it in accordance with Oldenberg's suggestion,  would have some force. The former motive, despite Oldenberg's doubt, seems fully justified. Pargiter<ref name=fx16_ve2_441/> has gone so far as to suggest that in [[मगध|Magadha]] the Āryans met and mingled with a body of invaders from the east by sea. Though there is no evidence for this view in the Vedic texts, it is reasonable to suppose that the farther east the Āryans penetrated, the less did they impress themselves upon the aborigines. Modern ethnology confirms this ''a priori'' supposition in so far as it shows Āryan types growing less and less marked as the eastern part of India is reached, although such evidence is not decisive in view of the great intermixture of peoples in India.<br>

All three words have been considered Semitic in origin, as borrowed from the Phœnicians<ref name=fx3_ve2_474/> in the case of Greece, from Carthage by way  of Etruria or Sicily in the case of Rome, and from Babylon in the case of India. The identification as regards [[मना|Manā]] is very conjectural, depending merely on the probabilities of Babylonian borrowing<ref name=fx4_ve2_474/> seen--''e.g.,'' in the legend of the flood, and in the system of the '''Nakṣatras.''' On the other hand, Mahā may very well be identical with the word ''[[मना|manā]]'' which occurs several times in the Rigveda<ref name=fx5_ve2_474/> in the sense of ‘desire’ (from the root ''man,'' ‘think’), and which may have in this one passage the concrete sense of ‘desirable object.’ It is to be noted that in Bo7htlingk's Dictionary a single word [[मना|Manā]] appears, to which the only senses assigned are ‘wish,’ ‘desire,’ ‘jealousy.’<br>

The former sense is supported by another passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx2_ve2_492/> where the Mayu, being a substitute for the man, must be an ape.

मांस|māṃsa|maaMsa|మాంస|ಮಾಂಸ|_vei2@553|_vei2_pn145
<u>'''Māṃsa,'''</u> ‘flesh.’ The eating of flesh appears as something quite regular in the Vedic texts, which show no trace of the doctrine of Ahiṃsā, or abstaining from injury to animals. For example, the ritual offerings of flesh contemplate that the gods will eat it, and again the Brahmins ate the offerings.<ref name=fx1_ve2_553/> Again, the slaying of a ‘great ox’ (''[[महोक्ष|mahokṣa]]'') or a ‘great goat’ (''[[महाज|mahāja]]'') for a guest was regularly prescribed;<ref name=fx2_ve2_553/> and the name '''[[अतिथिग्व|Atithigva]]''' probably means ‘slaying cows for guests.’<ref name=fx3_ve2_553/> The great sage '''[[याज्ञवल्क्य|Yājñavalkya]]''' was wont to eat the meat of milch cows and bullocks (''dhenv-anaḍuha'') if only it was ''aṃsala'' (‘firm’ or ‘tender’).<ref name=fx4_ve2_553/> The slaughter of a hundred bulls (''[[उक्षन्|ukṣan]]'') was credited to one sacrificer, '''[[अगस्त्य|Agastya]].'''<ref name=fx5_ve2_553/> The marriage ceremony was accompanied by the slaying of oxen, clearly for food.<ref name=fx6_ve2_553/> <br><br>That there was any general objection to the eating of flesh is most improbable. Sometimes it is forbidden, as when a man is performing a vow,<ref name=fx7_ve2_553/> or its use is disapproved, as in a passage of the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx8_ve2_553/> where meat is classed with '''[[सुरा|Surā]],''' or intoxicating liquor, as a bad thing. Again, in the Rigveda<ref name=fx9_ve2_553/> the slaying of the cows is said to take place in the '''Aghās,''' a deliberate variation for '''[[मघास्|Maghās]];''' but this may be the outcome merely of a natural association of death with gloom, even when cows alone are the victims in question. The Brāhmaṇas also contain the doctrine of the eater in this world being eaten in the next,<ref name=fx10_ve2_553/> but this is not to be regarded as a moral or religious disapproval of eating flesh, though it no doubt contains the germ of such a view, which is also in harmony with the persuasion of the unity of existence, which becomes marked in the Brāhmaṇas. But Ahiṃsā as a developed and articulate doctrine would seem to have arisen from the acceptance of the doctrine of transmigration, which in its fundamentals is later than the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] period.<ref name=fx11_ve2_553/><br><br>On the other hand, it is to be noted that the cow was on the road to acquire special sanctity in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx12_ve2_553/> as is shown by the name ''[[अघ्न्या|aghnyā]],''<ref name=fx13_ve2_553/> ‘not to be slain,’ applied to it in several passages. But this fact cannot be regarded as showing that  meat eating generally was condemned. Apart from mythical considerations, such as the identification of the cow with earth or Aditi (which are, of course, much more than an effort of priestly ingenuity), the value of the cow for other purposes than eating was so great as to account adequately for its sanctity, the beginnings of which can in fact be traced back to Indo-Iranian times.<ref name=fx14_ve2_553/> Moreover, the ritual of the cremation of the dead required the slaughter of a cow as an essential part, the flesh being used to envelope the dead body.<ref name=fx15_ve2_553/><br><br>The usual food of the Vedic Indian, as far as flesh was concerned, can be gathered from the list of sacrificial victims: what man ate he presented to the gods--that is, the sheep, the goat, and the ox. The horse sacrifice was an infrequent exception: it is probably not to be regarded as a trace of the use of horseflesh as food, though the possibility of such being the case cannot be overlooked in view of the widespread use of horseflesh as food in different countries and times. It is, however, more likely that the aim of this sacrifice was to impart magic strength, the speed and vigour of the horse, to the god and his worshippers, as Oldenberg<ref name=fx16_ve2_553/> argues.<br>

मास|māsa|maasa|మాస|ಮಾಸ|_vei2@602|_vei2_pn156
<u>'''Māsa'''</u> denotes a ‘month,’ a period of time repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda and later.<br><br>The characteristic days (or rather nights) of the month were those of the new moon, Amā-vasyā, ‘home-staying (night),’ and ‘of the full moon,’ [[पौर्ण-मासी|Paurṇa-māsī]]. Two hymns of the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx1_ve2_602/> celebrate these days respectively. A personification of the phases of the moon is seen in the four names [[सिनीवाली|Sinīvālī]],<ref name=fx2_ve2_602/>  the day before new moon; [[कुहू|Kuhū]],<ref name=fx3_ve2_602/> also called Guṅgū,<ref name=fx4_ve2_602/> the new moon day; [[अनुमति|Anumati]],<ref name=fx5_ve2_602/> the day before full moon; and [[राका|Rākā]],<ref name=fx6_ve2_602/> the day of new moon. The importance of the new and full moon days is seen in the [[दर्श|Darśa]]-pūrṇamāsau, or festivals of the new and full moon days respectively.<br><br>One special day in the month, the '''[[एकाष्टका|Ekāṣṭakā]],''' or eighth day after full moon, was important. In the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx7_ve2_602/> there are stated to be in the year twelve such, mentioned between the twelve days of full moon and the twelve days of new moon. But one [[एकाष्टका|Ekāṣṭakā]] is referred to in the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]] Saṃhitās and elsewhere<ref name=fx8_ve2_602/> as of quite special importance. This was, in the accordant opinion of most commentators, the eighth day after the full moon of '''Māgha.''' It marked the end of the year, or the beginning of the new year. Though the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx9_ve2_602/> places the winter solstice in the new moon of Māgha, the latter date probably means the new moon preceding full moon in Māgha,<ref name=fx10_ve2_602/> not the new moon following  full moon; but it is perhaps possible to account adequately for the importance of the [[एकाष्टका|Ekāṣṭakā]] as being the first [[अष्टका|Aṣṭakā]] after the beginning of the new year.<br><br>It is not certain exactly how the month was reckoned, whether from the day after new moon to new moon--the system known as ''amānta,'' or from the day after full moon to full moon--the ''pūrṇimānta'' system, which later, at any rate, was followed in North India, while the other system prevailed in the south. Jacobi<ref name=fx11_ve2_602/> argues that the year began in the full moon of Phālguna, and that only by the full moon's conjunction with the [[नक्षत्र|Nakṣatra]] could the month be known. Oldenberg<ref name=fx12_ve2_602/> points to the fact that the new moon is far more distinctively an epoch than the full moon; that the Greek, Roman, and Jewish years began with the new moon; and that the Vedic evidence is the division of the month into the former (''pūrva'') and latter (''apara'') halves, the first being the bright (''[[शुक्ल|śukla]]''), the second the dark (''[[कृष्ण|kṛṣṇa]]'') period. Thibaut<ref name=fx13_ve2_602/> considers that to assume the existence of the ''pūrṇimānta'' system for the Veda is unnecessary, though possible. Weber<ref name=fx10_ve2_602/> assumes that it occurs in the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] as held by the scholiasts. But it would probably be a mistake to press that passage, or to assume that the ''amānta'' system was rigidly accepted in the Veda: it seems at least as probable that the month was vaguely regarded as beginning with the new moon day, so that new moon preceded full moon, which was in the middle, not the end or the beginning of the month.<br><br>That a month regularly had 30 days is established by the conclusive evidence of numerous passages in which the year is given 12 months and 360 days. This month is known from the earliest records, being both referred to directly and alluded to.<ref name=fx14_ve2_602/>  It is the regular month of the Brāhmaṇas,<ref name=fx15_ve2_602/> and must be regarded as the month which the Vedic Indian recognized. No other month is mentioned as such in the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] literature; it is only in the Sūtras that months of different length occur. The [[सामवेद|Sāmaveda]] Sūtras<ref name=fx16_ve2_602/> refer to (1) years with 324 days--''i.e.,'' periodic years with 12 months of 27 days each; (2) years with 351 days--''i.e.,'' periodic years with 12 months of 27 days each, plus another month of 27 days; (3) years with 354 days--''i.e.,'' 6 months of 30 days, and 6 with 29 days, in other words, lunar synodic years; (4) years with 360 days, or ordinary civil (''sāvana'') years; (5) years with 378 days, which, as Thibaut<ref name=fx17_ve2_602/> clearly shows, are third years, in which, after two years of 360 days each, 18 days were added to bring about correspondence between the civil year and the solar year of 366 days. But even the Sāmasūtras do not mention the year of 366 days, which is first known to the [[ज्योतिष|Jyotiṣa]]<ref name=fx18_ve2_602/> and to [[गर्ग|Garga]].<ref name=fx19_ve2_602/><br><br>That the Vedic period was acquainted with the year of 354 days cannot be affirmed with certainty. Zimmer,<ref name=fx20_ve2_602/> indeed, thinks that it is proved by the fact that pregnancy is estimated at ten months, or sometimes a year.<ref name=fx21_ve2_602/> But Weber<ref name=fx22_ve2_602/> may be right in holding that the month is the periodic month of 27 days, for the period is otherwise too long if a year is taken. On the other hand, the period of ten months quite well suits the period of gestation, if birth takes place in the tenth month, so that in this sense the month of 30 days may well be meant. <br><br>The year of 12 months of 30 days each being admittedly quite unscientific, Zimmer<ref name=fx23_ve2_602/> is strongly of opinion that it was only used with a recognition of the fact that intercalation took place, and that the year formed part of a greater complex, normally the five your Yuga or cycle. This system is well known from the Jyotṣa: it consists of 62 months of 29(16/31) days each = 1, 830 days (two of these months being intercalary, one in the middle and one at the end), or 61 months of 30 days, or 60 months of 30(1/2) days, the unit being clearly a solar year of 366 days. It is not an ideal system, since the year is too long;<ref name=fx24_ve2_602/> but it is one which cannot be claimed even for the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] period, during which no decision as to the true length of the year seems to have been arrived at. The references to it seen by Zimmer in the Rigveda<ref name=fx25_ve2_602/> are not even reasonably plausible, while the ''pañcaka yuga,'' cited by him from the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx26_ve2_602/> occurs only in a quotation in a commentary, and had no authority for the text itself.<br><br>On the other hand, there was undoubtedly some attempt to bring the year of 360 days--a synodic lunar year--roughly into connexion with reality. A Sāmasūtra<ref name=fx27_ve2_602/> treats it as a solar year, stating that he sun perambulates each Naxatra in 13(1/3) days, while others again evidently interpolated 18 days every third year, in order to arrive at some equality. But Vedic literature, from the Rigveda<ref name=fx28_ve2_602/> downwards,<ref name=fx29_ve2_602/> teems with the assertion of the difficulty of ascertaining the month. The length is variously given as 30 days,<ref name=fx30_ve2_602/> 35 days,<ref name=fx31_ve2_602/> or  36 days.<ref name=fx32_ve2_602/> The last number possibly indicates an intercalation after six years (6×6 = 36, or for ritual purposes 35), but for this we have no special evidence. There are many references<ref name=fx33_ve2_602/> to the year having 12 or 13 months.<br><br>The names of the months are, curiously enough, not at all ancient. The sacrificial texts of the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]] give them in their clearest form where the Agnicayana, ‘building of the fire-altar,’ is described.<ref name=fx34_ve2_602/> These names are the following: (1) [[मधु|Madhu]], (2) Mādhava (spring months, ''vāsantikāv ṛtū''); (3) [[शुक्र|Śukra]], (4) Śuci (summer months, ''graiṣmāv ṛtū''); (5) Nabha (or Nabhas),<ref name=fx35_ve2_602/> (6) Nabhasya (rainy months, ''vārṣikāv ṛtū''); (7) Iṣa, (8) Ūrja (autumn months, ''śāradāv ṛtū''); (9) Saha (or Sahas),<ref name=fx35_ve2_602/> (10) Sahasya (winter months, ''haimantikāv ṛtū''); (11) Tapa (or [[तपस्|Tapas]]),<ref name=fx35_ve2_602/> (12) Tapasya (cool months, ''śaiśirāv ṛtū'').<br><br>There are similar lists in the descriptions of the Soma sacrifice<ref name=fx36_ve2_602/> and of the horse sacrifice,<ref name=fx37_ve2_602/> all of them agreeing in essentials. There are other lists of still more fanciful names,<ref name=fx38_ve2_602/> but these have no claim at all to represent actual divisions in popular use. It is doubtful if the list given above is more than a matter of priestly invention. Weber points out that [[मधु|Madhu]] and Mādhava later appear as names of spring, and that these two are mentioned in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Āraṇyaka<ref name=fx39_ve2_602/> as if actually  employed; but the evidence is very inadequate to show that the other names of the months given in the list were in ordinary use.<ref name=fx40_ve2_602/><br><br>In some of these lists the intercalary month is mentioned. The name given to it in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<ref name=fx41_ve2_602/> is [[अंहसस्पति|Aṃhasaspati]], while that given in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]]<ref name=fx42_ve2_602/> and Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitās<ref name=fx43_ve2_602/> is [[संसर्प|Saṃsarpa]]. The [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx44_ve2_602/> gives it the name of [[मलिम्लुच|Malimluca]], which also occurs elsewhere, along with [[संसर्प|Saṃsarpa]], in one of the lists of fanciful names.<ref name=fx45_ve2_602/> The Atharvaveda<ref name=fx46_ve2_602/> describes it as ''[[सनिस्रस|sanisrasa]],'' ‘slipping,’ owing no doubt to its unstable condition.<br><br>The other method of naming the months is from the '''Nakṣatras.''' It is only beginning to be used in the Brāhmaṇas, but is found regularly in the Epic and later. The [[ज्योतिष|Jyotiṣa]]<ref name=fx47_ve2_602/> mentions that Māgha and Tapa were identical: this is the fair interpretation of the passage, which also involves the identification of [[मधु|Madhu]] with [[चैत्र|Caitra]], a result corresponding with the view frequently found in the Brāhmaṇas, that the full moon in [[चित्रा|Citrā]], and not that in [[फल्गुनी|Phalgunī]], is the beginning of the year.<ref name=fx48_ve2_602/><br><br>In the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx49_ve2_602/> are found two curious expressions, ''yava'' and ''ayava,'' for the light and dark halves of the month, which is clearly considered to begin with the light half. Possibly the words are derived, as Eggling<ref name=fx50_ve2_602/> thinks, from ''yu,'' ‘ward off,’ with reference to evil spirits. The word '''[[पर्वन्|Parvan]]'''  (‘joint’ = division of time) probably<ref name=fx51_ve2_602/> denotes a half of the month, perhaps already in the Rigveda.<ref name=fx52_ve2_602/> More precisely the first half, the time of the waxing light, is called ''[[पूर्व-पक्ष|pūrva-pakṣa]],''<ref name=fx53_ve2_602/> the second, that of the waning light, ''apara-[[पक्ष|pakṣa]],''<ref name=fx54_ve2_602/> Either of these might be called a half-month (''ardha-[[मास|māsa]]'').<ref name=fx55_ve2_602/><br>

<u>'''Mudgala'''</u> and '''Mudgalanī,''' ‘Mudgala's wife,’ both figure in a hopelessly obscure hymn of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx1_ve2_621/> variously interpreted by Pischel<ref name=fx2_ve2_621/> and Geldner<ref name=fx3_ve2_621/> and von Bradke<ref name=fx4_ve2_621/> as telling of a real chariot race in which, despite difficulties, [[मुद्गल|Mudgala]] won by his wife's aid.

[[यास्क|Yāska]],<ref name=fx6_ve2_621/> on the other hand, says that [[मुद्गल|Mudgala]] won a race with a ''[[द्रुघण|drughaṇa]]'' and an ox instead of with two oxen.

मुनि|muni|ముని|ಮುನಿ|_vei2@622|_vei2_pn167
<u>'''Muni'''</u> occurs in one hymn of the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve2_622/> where it seems to denote an ascetic of magic powers with divine afflatus (''deveṣita''), the precursor of the strange ascetics of later India. This agrees with the fact that '''[[ऐतश|Aitaśa]],''' the Muni, is in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx2_ve2_622/> regarded by his son as deranged, a view not unjustified if the nonsense which passes as the Aitaśapralāpa.<ref name=fx3_ve2_622/> ‘Chatter of [[ऐतश|Aitaśa]],’ was really his. The Rigveda<ref name=fx4_ve2_622/> calls Indra the ‘friend of Munis,’ and the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx5_ve2_622/> refers to a ‘divine Muni’ (''deva muni''), by whom a similar ascetic may be meant.<br><br>In the Upaniṣads<ref name=fx6_ve2_622/> the Muni is of a more restrained type: he is one who learns the nature of the [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]], the Absolute, by study, or sacrifice, or penance, or fasting, or faith (''śraddhā''). It must not of course be thought that there is any absolute distinction between the older Muni and the later: in both cases the man is in a peculiar ecstatic condition, but the ideal of the Upaniṣads is less material than the earlier picture of the Muni, who is more of a ‘medicine man’ than a sage. Nor would it be wise to conclude from the comparative rareness  of the mention of the Muni in the Vedic texts that he was an infrequent figure in Vedic times: he was probably not approved by the priests who followed the ritual, and whose views were essentially different from the ideals of a Muni, which were superior to earthly considerations, such as the desire for children and '''Dakṣiṇās.'''<ref name=fx7_ve2_622/><br>

<u>'''Mṛgayu,'''</u> ‘hunter,’ occurs in the later Saṃhitās<ref name=fx1_ve2_640/> and the Brāhmaṇas,<ref name=fx2_ve2_640/> but not very often. The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<ref name=fx3_ve2_640/> and the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx4_ve2_640/> however, in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) include a number of names which seem to be those of persons who make a livelihood by fishing or by hunting, such as the '''[[मार्गार|Mārgāra]],''' ‘hunter,’  the '''[[कैवर्त|Kaivarta]]''' or '''[[केवर्त|Kevarta]], [[पौञ्जिष्ठ|Pauñjiṣṭha]], Daśa, [[मैनाल|Maināla]],''' ‘fisher man,’ and perhaps the '''[[बैन्द|Bainda]]''' and the Ānda,<ref name=fx5_ve2_640/> who seem to have been some sort of fishermen.<br><br>It is not probable that even in the earliest Vedic period hunting formed the main source of livelihood for any of the Vedic tribes: pastoral pursuits and agriculture ('''[[कृषि|Kṛṣi]]''') were, no doubt, the mainstay of their existence. But it would be unreasonable to suppose that not much hunting was done, both for recreation and for purposes of food, as well as for protection of flocks from wild beasts. The Rigveda is naturally our chief source of information in regard to hunting. The arrow was sometimes employed,<ref name=fx6_ve2_640/> but, as is usual with primitive man, the normal instruments of capture were nets and pitfalls. Birds were regularly caught in nets ('''[[पाश|Pāśa]],'''<ref name=fx7_ve2_640/> '''[[निधा|Nidhā]],'''<ref name=fx8_ve2_640/> '''[[जाल|Jāla]]'''),<ref name=fx9_ve2_640/> The bird-catcher being called ''[[निधा|nidhā]]-pati,''<ref name=fx10_ve2_640/> ‘master of snares.’ The net was fastened on pegs<ref name=fx11_ve2_640/> (as is done with modern nets for catching birds). Another name of net is apparently '''[[मुक्षीजा|Mukṣījā]].'''<br><br>Pits were used for catching antelopes ('''[[ऋश्य|Ṛśya]]'''), and so were called ''[[ऋश्य|ṛśya]]-da,''<ref name=fx12_ve2_640/> ‘antelope-catching.’ Elephants were captured as in Greek times, perhaps through the instrumentality of tame females (see '''[[मृग हस्तिन्|Mṛga Hastin]]'''). Apparently the boar was captured in the chase, dogs being used,<ref name=fx13_ve2_640/> but the passage from which this view is deduced is of uncertain mythological content. There is also an obscure reference<ref name=fx14_ve2_640/> to the capture of the buffalo ('''[[गौर|Gaura]]'''), but it is not clear whether the reference is to shooting with an arrow or capturing by means of ropes, perhaps a lasso, or a net. The lion was captured in pitfalls,<ref name=fx15_ve2_640/> or was surrounded by the hunters and slain;<ref name=fx16_ve2_640/> one very obscure passage refers to the lion being caught by ambuscade, which perhaps merely alludes to the use of the hidden pit.<ref name=fx17_ve2_640/><br><br>The modes of catching fish are little known, for the only evidence available are the explanations of the various names  mentioned in the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]]. Sāyaṇa<ref name=fx18_ve2_640/> says that '''[[धैवर|Dhaivara]]''' is one who takes fish by netting a tank on either side; [[दाश|Dāśa]] and '''[[शौष्कल|Śauṣkala]]''' do so by means of a fish-hook (''baḍiśa''); [[बैन्द|Bainda]], [[कैवर्त|Kaivarta]], and [[मैनाल|Maināla]] by means of a net (''[[जाल|jāla]]''); [[मार्गार|Mārgāra]] catches fish in the water with his hands; Ānda by putting in pegs at a ford (apparently by building a sort of dam); '''[[पर्णक|Parṇaka]]''' by putting a poisoned leaf on the water. But none of these explanations can claim much authority.<br>

Zimmer<ref name=fx6_ve2_719/> adduces a passage from the Rigveda,<ref name=fx7_ve2_719/> but the reference there, whatever it may be,<ref name=fx8_ve2_719/> is certainly not to the four ages (''cf.'' also '''[[त्रियुग|Triyuga]]''').<ref name=fx9_ve2_719/> The [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx10_ve2_719/> recognizes long periods of time--''e.g.,'' one of 100,000 years.<br><br>To the four ages, Kali, [[द्वापर|Dvāpara]], Tretā, and [[कृत|Kṛta]], there is no certain reference in Vedic literature, though the names occur as the designations of throws at dice (see '''[[अक्ष|Akṣa]]''').

Of differences in the structure of the two we have no information, except that the '''Kha,''' or nave hole, in the wheel of the chariot was greater than in that of the cart.<ref name=fx3_ve2_753/><br><br>The chariot has, as a rule, two wheels ('''[[चक्र|Cakra]]'''), to which reference is frequently made.<ref name=fx4_ve2_753/> The wheel consisted of a rim ('''Pavi'''), a felly ('''[[प्रधि|Pradhi]]'''), spokes ('''Ara'''),<ref name=fx5_ve2_753/> and a nave ('''[[नभ्य|Nabhya]]'''). The rim and the felly together constitute the '''Nemi.''' The hole in the nave is called '''Kha:''' into it the end of the axle was inserted; but there is some uncertainty whether '''[[आणि|Āṇi]]''' denotes the extremity of the axle that was inserted in the nave, or the lynch-pin used to keep that extremity in the wheel. Sometimes a solid wheel was used.<ref name=fx6_ve2_753/><br><br>The axle ('''[[अक्ष|Akṣa]]''') was, in some cases, made of '''[[अरटु|Araṭu]]''' wood;<ref name=fx7_ve2_753/> round its ends the wheels revolved.

The epithet ''tri-[[वन्धुर|vandhura]]'' is used of the chariot of the Aśvins, seemingly to correspond with another of its epithets, ''tri-[[चक्र|cakra]]:'' perhaps, as Weber<ref name=fx8_ve2_753/> thinks, a chariot with three seats and three wheels was a real form of vehicle; but Zimmer<ref name=fx9_ve2_753/> considers that the vehicle was purely mythical.

The driver controlled the horses by reins, and urged them on with a whip (''Kaśā'').<ref name=fx14_ve2_753/> The girths of the horse were called Kakṣyā.<ref name=fx15_ve2_753/><br><br>The normal number of horses seems to have been two, but three or four<ref name=fx16_ve2_753/> were often used.

He is also referred to in the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]] Saṃhitās<ref name=fx2_ve2_754/> and in the Brāhmaṇas:<ref name=fx3_ve2_754/> in all these passages, as well a probably in the Atharvaveda also, the [[रथकार|Rathakāra]] already forms a caste. The  later system<ref name=fx4_ve2_754/> regards the [[रथकार|Rathakāra]] as the offspring of a Māhiṣya (the son of a [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] husband and a [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] wife) and a Karaṇī (the daughter of a [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] husband and a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] wife), but it is unreasonable to suppose that such an origin is historically accurate. The Rathakāras must rather be deemed to have been a functional caste. Hillebrandt<ref name=fx5_ve2_754/> suggests that the '''Anu''' tribe formed the basis of the [[रथकार|Rathakāra]] caste, referring to their worship of the Ṛbhus, who are, of course, the chariotmakers ''par excellence.'' But there is little ground for this view.<br>

Elsewhere<ref name=fx2_ve2_782/> it is the name of a mythic stream at the ends of the earth, which as well as the atinosphere it encompasses. It is reasonable to assume that, as in the case of the '''[[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]],''' the literal is the older sense, and to see in the river a genuine stream, perhaps originally the Araxes or Jaxartes, because the Vendidad mentions the Raṅhā, the Avestan form of [[रसा|Rasā]]. But the word seems originally to allude merely to the ‘sap’ or ‘flavour’ of the waters,<ref name=fx3_ve2_782/> and so could be applied to every river, like [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]].<br>

राजन्|१। राजन्|rājan|raajan|రాజన్|ರಾಜನ್|_vei2@790|_vei2_pn210
<u>'''1. Rājan,'''</u> ‘king,’ is a term repeatedly occurring in the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve2_790/> and the later literature.<ref name=fx2_ve2_790/> It is quite clear that the normal, though not universal form of government, in early India was that by kings, as might be expected in view of the fact that the Āryan Indians were invaders in a hostile territory: a situation which, as in the case of the Āryan invaders of Greece and of the German invaders of England, resulted almost necessarily in strengthening the monarchic element of the constitution.<ref name=fx3_ve2_790/> The mere patriarchal organization of society is not sufficient, as Zimmer<ref name=fx4_ve2_790/> assumes, to explain the Vedic kingship. <br><br>''Tenure of Monarchy.''--Zimmer<ref name=fx5_ve2_790/> is of opinion that while the Vedic monarchy was sometimes hereditary, as is indeed shown by several cases where the descent can be traced,<ref name=fx6_ve2_790/> yet in others the monarchy was elective, though it is not clear whether the selection by the people was between the members of the royal family only or extended to members of all the noble clans. It must, however, be admitted that the evidence for the elective monarchy is not strong. As Geldner<ref name=fx7_ve2_790/> argues, all the passages cited<ref name=fx8_ve2_790/> can be regarded not as choice by the cantons ('''[[विश्|Viś]]'''), but as acceptance by the subjects (''[[विश्|viś]]''): this seems the more probable sense. Of course this is no proof that the monarchy was not sometimes elective: the practice of selecting one member of the family to the exclusion of another less well qualified is exemplified by the legend in [[यास्क|Yāska]]<ref name=fx9_ve2_790/> of the Kuru brothers, '''Devāpi''' and '''Śantanu,''' the value of which, as evidence of contemporary views, is not seriously affected by the legend itself being of dubious character and validity.<br><br>Royal power was clearly insecure: there are several references to kings being expelled from their realms, and their efforts to recover their sovereignty,<ref name=fx10_ve2_790/> and the Atharvaveda contains spells in the interest of royalty.<ref name=fx11_ve2_790/><br><br>''The King in War.''--Naturally the Vedic texts, after the Rigveda, contain few notices of the warlike adventures that no doubt formed a very considerable proportion of the royal functions. But the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx12_ve2_790/> contains the statement that the '''Kuru-[[पञ्चाल|Pañcāla]]''' kings, who, like the Brahmins of  those tribes, stand as representatives of good form, used to make their raids in the dewy season. The word '''[[उद्आज|Udāja]],''' too, with its variant Nirāja, records that kings took a share of the booty of war. The Rigveda<ref name=fx13_ve2_790/> has many references to Vedic wars: it is clear that the Kṣatriyas were at least as intent on fulfilling their duty of war as the Brahmins on sacrificing and their other functions. Moreover, beside offensive war, defence was a chief duty of the king: he is emphatically the ‘protector of the tribe’ (''[[गोपा|gopā]] janasya''), or, as is said in the '''[[राजसूय|Rājasūya]]''' (‘royal consecration’), ‘protector of the Brahmin.’<ref name=fx14_ve2_790/> His '''[[पुरोहित|Purohita]]''' was expected to use his spells and charms to secure the success of his king's arms. The king no doubt fought in person: so '''[[प्रतर्दन|Pratardana]]''' met death in war according to the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]];<ref name=fx15_ve2_790/> and in the [[राजसूय|Rājasūya]] the king is invoked as ‘sacker of cities’ (''purāṃ bhettā'').<br><br>''The King in Peace.''--In return for his warlike services the king received the obedience<ref name=fx16_ve2_790/> --sometimes forced<ref name=fx17_ve2_790/> --of the people, and in particular their contributions for the maintenance of royalty. The king is regularly<ref name=fx18_ve2_790/> regarded as ‘devouring  the people,’ but this phrase must not be explained as meaning that he necessarily oppressed them. It obviously has its origin in a custom by which the king and his retinue were fed by the people's contributions, a plan with many parallels. It is also probable that the king could assign the royal right of maintenance to a [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]], thus developing a nobility supported by the people. Taxation would not normally fall on [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] or Brahmin; the texts contam emphatic assertions of the exemption of the goods of the latter from the royal bounty.<ref name=fx19_ve2_790/>In the people, however, lay the strength of the king.<ref name=fx20_ve2_790/> See also '''Bali.'''<br><br>In return the king performed the duties of judge. Himself immune from punishment (''a-daṇḍya''), he wields the rod of punishment ('''[[दण्ड|Daṇḍa]]''').<ref name=fx21_ve2_790/> It is probable that criminal justice remained largely in his actual administration, for the Sūtras<ref name=fx22_ve2_790/> preserve clear traces of the personal exercise of royal criminal jurisdiction. Possibly the jurisdiction could be exercised by a royal officer, or even by a delegate, for a [[राजन्य|Rājanya]] is mentioned as an overseer (''adhyakṣa'') of the punishment of a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] in the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā.<ref name=fx23_ve2_790/> In civil justice it may be that the king played a much less prominent part, save as a court of final appeal, but evidence is lacking on this head. The '''[[मध्यमशी|Madhyamaśī]]''' of the Rigveda was probably not a royal, but a private judge or arbitrator. A wide criminal jurisdiction is, however, to some extent supported<ref name=fx24_ve2_790/> by the frequent mention of Varuṇa's spies, for Varuṇa is the divine counterpart of the human king.<ref name=fx25_ve2_790/> Possibly such spies could be used in war also.<ref name=fx26_ve2_790/><br><br>There is no reference in early Vedic literature to the exercise of legislative activitv by the king, though later it is an essential  part of his duties.<ref name=fx27_ve2_790/> Nor can we say exactly what executive functions devolved on the king.<br><br>In all his acts the king was regularly advised by his '''[[पुरोहित|Purohita]];''' he also had the advantage of the advice of the royal ministers and attendants (see '''[[रत्निन्|Ratnin]]'''). The local administration was entrusted to the '''Grāmaṇī,''' or village chief, who may have been selected or appointed by the king. The outward signs of the king's rank were his palace<ref name=fx28_ve2_790/> and his brilliant dress.<ref name=fx29_ve2_790/><br><br>''The King as Landowner.''--The position of the king with regard to the land is somewhat obscure. The Greek notices,<ref name=fx30_ve2_790/> in which, unhappily, it would be dangerous to put much trust, since they were collected by observers who were probably little used to accurate investigations of such matters, and whose statements were based on inadequate information, vary in their statements. In part they speak of rent being paid, and declare that only the king and no private person could own land, while in part they refer to the taxation of land. Hopkins<ref name=fx31_ve2_790/> is strongly of opinion that the payments made were paid for protection-''i.e.,'' in modern terminology as a tax, but that the king was recognized as the owner of all the land, while yet the individual or the joint family also owned the land. As against BadenPowell,<ref name=fx32_ve2_790/> who asserted that the idea of the king as a landowner was later, he urges for the Vedic period that the king, as we have seen, is described as devouring the people, and that, according to the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx33_ve2_790/> the '''[[वैश्य|Vaiśya]]''' can be devoured at will and maltreated (but, unlike the '''[[शूद्र|Śūdra]],''' not killed); and for the period of the legal Sūtras and Śāstras he cites [[बृहस्पति|Bṛhaspati]] and [[नारद|Nārada]] as clearly recognizing the king's overlordship, besides a passage of the [[मानव|Mānava]] [[धर्म|Dharma]] Śāstra<ref name=fx34_ve2_790/> which describes the king as ‘lord of all,’ a phrase which  Bühler<ref name=fx35_ve2_790/> was inclined to interpret as a proof of landowning. The evidence is, however, inadequate to prove what is sought. It is not denied that gradually the king came to be vaguely conceived--as the English king still is--as lord of all the land in a proprietorial sense, but it is far more probable that such an idea was only a gradual development than that it was primitive. The power of devouring the people is a political power, not a right of ownership; precisely the same feature can be traced in South Africa,<ref name=fx36_ve2_790/> where the chief can deprive a man arbitrarily of his land, though the land is really owned by the native. The matter is ultimately to some extent one of terminology, but the parallel cases are in favour of distinguishing between the political rights of the crown, which can be transferred by way of a grant, and the rights of ownership. Hopkins<ref name=fx37_ve2_790/> thinks that the gifts of land to priests, which seems to be the first sign of land transactions in the Brāhmaṇas, was an actual gift of land; it may have been so in many cases, but it may easily also have been the grant of a superiority: the Epic grants are hardly decisive one way or the other.<br><br>For the relations of the king with the assembly, see '''[[सभा|Sabhā]];''' for his consecration, see '''[[राजसूय|Rājasūya]].'''

The word appears to be derived from a form of the root ''vah,'' ‘to carry,’ as is ''[[वहतु|vahatu]],'' ‘the bridal procession,’ thus meaning ‘she who is to be or has been conducted home.’ Zimmer,<ref name=fx4_ve2_915/> however, objects to this explanation, regarding ''[[वधू|vadhū]]'' as a derivative from a different root meaning ‘to marry.’<br>

The same doubt arises in the case of ''vadhūmant,'' which is used in the Rigveda and Atharvaveda as an epithet of the chariot ('''[[रथ|Ratha]]'''),<ref name=fx4_ve2_916/> of horses ('''[[अश्व|Aśva]]'''),<ref name=fx5_ve2_916/> and of buffaloes ('''Uṣṭra''').<ref name=fx6_ve2_916/> Zimmer sees in all cases a reference to slaves in the chariots or with the horses: this interpretation has the support of the Bṛhaddevatā.<ref name=fx7_ve2_916/> Roth's version of the references to horses or buffaloes as ‘suitable for draught’ is not very happy; if ''[[वधू|vadhū]]'' is really a female animal ''vadhūmant'' means rather ‘together with mares,’ or ‘together with female buffaloes,’ which makes reasonable sense.<ref name=fx8_ve2_916/><br>

वर्ण|२। वर्ण|varṇa|varNa|వర్ణ|ವರ್ಣ|_vei2@950|_vei2_pn247
<u>'''2. Varṇa'''</u> (lit. ‘colour’) in the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve2_950/> is applied to denote classes of men, the '''[[दास|Dāsa]]''' and the Āryan [[वर्ण|Varṇa]] being contrasted, as other passages<ref name=fx2_ve2_950/> show, on account of colour. But this use is confined to distinguishing two colours: in this respect the Rigveda differs fundamentally from the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas,<ref name=fx3_ve2_950/> where the four castes (''varṇāḥ'') are already fully recognized.<br><br>''(a) Caste in the Rigveda.''--The use of the term [[वर्ण|Varṇa]] is not, of course, conclusive for the question whether caste existed in the Rigveda. In one sense it must be admitted to have existed: the [[पुरुष|Puruṣa]]-[[सूक्त|sūkta]], ‘hymn of man,’ in the tenth  Maṇḍala<ref name=fx4_ve2_950/> clearly contemplates the division of mankind into four classes--the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], [[राजन्य|Rājanya]], [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]], and [[शूद्र|Śūdra]]. But the hymn being admittedly late,<ref name=fx5_ve2_950/> its evidence is not cogent for the bulk of the Rigveda. Zimmer<ref name=fx6_ve2_950/> has with great force combatted the view that the Rigveda was produced in a society that knew the caste system. He points out that the Brāhmaṇas<ref name=fx7_ve2_950/> show us the Vedic Indians on the Indus as unbrahminized, and not under the caste system; he argues that the Rigveda was the product of tribes living in the Indus region and the Panjab; later on a part of this people, who had wandered farther east, developed the peculiar civilization of the caste system. He adopts the arguments of Muir,<ref name=fx8_ve2_950/> derived from the study of the data of the Rigveda, viz.: that (''a'') the four castes appear only in the late Puruṣasūkta; (''b'') the term [[वर्ण|Varṇa]], as shown above, covers the three highest castes of later times, and is only contrasted with [[दास|Dāsa]]; (''c'') that [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] is rare in the Rigveda, [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] occurs seldom,<ref name=fx9_ve2_950/> [[राजन्य|Rājanya]] only in the Puruṣasūkta, where too, alone, [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] and [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] are found; (''d'') that [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] denotes at first ‘poet,’ ‘sage,’ and then ‘officiating priest,’ or still later a special class of priest; (''e'') that in some only of the passages<ref name=fx10_ve2_950/> where it occurs does [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] denote a ‘priest by profession,’ while in others it denotes something peculiar to the individual, designating a person distinguished for genius or virtue, or specially chosen to receive divine inspiration.<ref name=fx11_ve2_950/> [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], on the other hand, as Muir admits,<ref name=fx12_ve2_950/> already denotes a hereditary professional priesthood.<br><br>Zimmer connects the change from the casteless system of the Rigveda to the elaborate system of the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]] with the  advance of the Vedic Indians to the east, comparing the Germanic invasions that transformed the German tribes into monarchies closely allied with the church. The needs of a conquering people evoke the monarch; the lesser princes sink to the position of nobles; for repelling the attacks of aborigines or of other Āryan tribes, and for quelling the revolts of the subdued population, the state requires a standing army in the shape of the armed retainers of the king, and beside the nobility of the lesser princes arises that of the king's chief retainers, as the Thegns supplemented the Gesiths of the Anglo-Saxon monarchies.<ref name=fx13_ve2_950/> At the same time the people ceased to take part in military matters, and under climatic influences left the conduct of war to the nobility and their retainers, devoting themselves to agriculture, pastoral pursuits, and trade. But the advantage won by the nobles over the people was shared by them with the priesthood, the origin of whose power lies in the Purohitaship, as Roth first saw.<ref name=fx14_ve2_950/><br><br>Originally the prince could sacrifice for himself and the people, but the Rigveda<ref name=fx15_ve2_950/> itself shows cases, like those of '''[[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]]''' and '''[[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]]''' illustrating forcibly the power of the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]], though at the same time the right of the noble to act as [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] is seen in the case of '''[[देवापि आर्ष्टिषेण|Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa]].'''<ref name=fx16_ve2_950/> The Brahmins saw their opportunity, through the Purohitaship, of gaining practical power during the confusion and difficulties of the wars of invasion, and secured it, though only after many struggles, the traces of which are seen in the Epic tradition.<ref name=fx17_ve2_950/> The Atharvaveda<ref name=fx18_ve2_950/> also preserves relics of these conflicts in its narration of the ruin of the '''Sṛñjayas''' because of oppressing Brahmins, and besides other hymns of the Atharvaveda (viiixii), the [[शतरुद्रिय|Śatarudriya]] litany of the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]]<ref name=fx19_ve2_950/> reflects the period of storm and stress when the aboriginal population was  still seething with discontent, and Rudra was worshipped as the patron god of all sorts of evil doers.<ref name=fx20_ve2_950/><br><br>This version of the development of caste has received a good deal of acceptance in its main outlines, and it may almost be regarded as the recognized version.<ref name=fx21_ve2_950/> It has, however, always been opposed by some scholars, such as Haug,<ref name=fx22_ve2_950/> Kern,<ref name=fx23_ve2_950/> Ludwig,<ref name=fx24_ve2_950/> and more recently by Oldenberg<ref name=fx25_ve2_950/> and by Geldner.<ref name=fx26_ve2_950/> The matter may be to some extent simplified by recognizing at once that the caste system is one that has progressively developed, and that it is not legitimate to see in the Rigveda the full caste system even of the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]]; but at the same time it is difficult to doubt that the system was already well on its way to general acceptance. The argument from the nonbrahminical character of the '''Vrātyas''' of the Indus and Panjab loses its force when it is remembered that there is much evidence in favour of placing the composition of the bulk of the Rigveda, especially the books<ref name=fx27_ve2_950/> in which '''[[सुदास्|Sudās]]''' appears with [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] and [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]], in the east, the later '''[[मध्यदेश|Madhyadeśa]],''' a view supported by Pischel,<ref name=fx28_ve2_950/> Geldner,<ref name=fx29_ve2_950/> Hopkins,<ref name=fx30_ve2_950/> and Macdonell.<ref name=fx31_ve2_950/> Nor is it possible to maintain that [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] in the Rigveda merely means a ‘poet’ or ‘sage.’ It is admitted by Muir that in some passages it must mean a hereditary profession; in fact, there is not a single passage in which it occurs where the sense of ‘priest’ is not allowable, since the priest was of course the singer. Moreover, there are traces in the Rigveda of the threefold<ref name=fx32_ve2_950/> or fourfold<ref name=fx33_ve2_950/> division of the people  into ''brahma, kṣatram,'' and ''viśaḥ,'' or into the three classes and the servile population. Nor even in respect to the later period, any more than to the Rigveda, is the view correct that regards the Vaiśyas as not taking part in war. The Rigveda evidently<ref name=fx34_ve2_950/> knows of no restriction of war to a nobility and its retainers, but the late Atharvaveda<ref name=fx35_ve2_950/> equally classes the folk with the ''bala,'' ‘power,’ representing the [[विश्|Viś]] as associated with the '''[[सभा|Sabhā]], [[सम्इति|Samiti]],''' and '''[[सेना|Senā]],''' the assemblies of the people and the armed host. Zimmer<ref name=fx36_ve2_950/> explains these references as due to tradition only; but this is hardly a legitimate argument, resting, as it does, on the false assumption that only a [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] can fight. But it is (see '''[[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]]''') very doubtful whether [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] means anything more than a member of the nobility, though later, in the Epic, it included the retainers of the nobility, who increased in numbers with the growth of military monarchies, and though later the ordinary people did not necessarily take part in wars, an abstention that is, however, much exaggerated if it is treated as an absolute one. The Kṣatriyas were no doubt a hereditary body; monarchy was already hereditary (see '''[[राजन्|Rājan]]'''), and it is admitted that the Śūdras were a separate body: thus all the elements of the caste system were already in existence. The [[पुरोहित|Purohita]], indeed, was a person of great importance, but it is clear, as Oldenberg<ref name=fx37_ve2_950/> urges, that he was not the creator of the power of the priesthood, but owed his position, and the influence he could in consequence exert, to the fact that the sacrifice required for its proper performance the aid of a hereditary priest in whose possession was the traditional sacred knowledge.<br><br>Nor can any argument for the non-existence of the caste system be derived from cases like that of '''Devāpi.''' For, in the first place, the Upaniṣads show kings in the exercise of the priestly functions of learning and teaching, and the Upaniṣads are certainly contemporaneous with an elaborated caste system. In the second place the Rigvedic evidence is very weak, for Devāpi, who certainly acts as [[पुरोहित|Purohita]], is not stated in the  Rigveda to be a prince at all, though [[यास्क|Yāska]]<ref name=fx38_ve2_950/> calls him a [[कौरव्य|Kauravya]]; the hymns attributed to kings and others cannot be vindicated for them by certain evidence, though here, again, the Brāhmaṇas do not scruple to recognize Rājanyarṣis, or ‘royal sages’; and the famous [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]] shows in the Rigveda no sign of the royal character which the Brāhmaṇas insist on fastening on him in the shape of royal descent in the line of '''[[जह्नु|Jahnu]].'''<ref name=fx39_ve2_950/><br><br>''(b) Caste in the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas.''--The relation between the later and the earlier periods of the Vedic history of caste must probably be regarded in the main as the hardening of a system already formed by the time of the Rigveda.<br><br>1. ''The Names of the Castes.''--The most regular names are [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], [[राजन्य|Rājanya]], [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]], and [[शूद्र|Śūdra]],<ref name=fx40_ve2_950/> or later [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]], [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]], and [[शूद्र|Śūdra]].<ref name=fx41_ve2_950/> There are many other variants: [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]], [[क्षत्र|Kṣatra]], Śūdrāryau;<ref name=fx42_ve2_950/> [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]], [[राजन्य|Rājanya]], [[शूद्र|Śūdra]], [[आर्य|Ārya]];<ref name=fx43_ve2_950/> [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]], [[राजन्य|Rājanya]], [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]], [[शूद्र|Śūdra]];<ref name=fx44_ve2_950/> [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], [[राजन्|Rājan]], Viśya, [[शूद्र|Śūdra]];<ref name=fx45_ve2_950/> Deva, [[राजन्|Rājan]], [[शूद्र|Śūdra]], [[आर्य|Ārya]];<ref name=fx46_ve2_950/> and [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]], [[क्षत्र|Kṣatra]], [[विश्|Viś]], and [[शूद्र|Śūdra]].<ref name=fx47_ve2_950/> In other cases the fourth class is represented by a special member: [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]], [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]], and [[चाण्डाल|Cāṇḍāla]].<ref name=fx48_ve2_950/> Often only the three upper classes are mentioned, as [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], [[राजन्य|Rājanya]], [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]];<ref name=fx49_ve2_950/> [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]], Kṣatram, [[विश्|Viś]],<ref name=fx50_ve2_950/>  etc.<ref name=fx51_ve2_950/> Three castes--[[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], [[राजन्|Rājan]], [[शूद्र|Śūdra]]--are mentioned in the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx52_ve2_950/> and two castes are repeatedly mentioned together, either [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] and [[क्षत्र|Kṣatra]], or [[क्षत्र|Kṣatra]] and [[विश्|Viś]].<ref name=fx53_ve2_950/><br><br>2. ''The Relation of the Castes.''--The ritual literature is full of minute differences respecting the castes. Thus, for example, the Śatapatha prescribes different sizes of funeral mounds for the four castes,<ref name=fx54_ve2_950/> Different modes of address are laid down for the four castes,<ref name=fx55_ve2_950/> as ''ehi,'' ‘approach’; ''āgaccha,'' ‘come’; ''ādrava,'' ‘run up’; ''ādhāva,'' ‘hasten up,’ which differ in degrees of politeness. The representatives of the four castes are dedicated at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) to different deities.<ref name=fx56_ve2_950/> The Sūtras have many similar rules.<ref name=fx57_ve2_950/><br><br>But the three upper castes in some respects differ markedly from the fourth, the Śūdras. The latter are in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx58_ve2_950/> declared not fit to be addressed by a Dīkṣita, ‘consecrated person,’ and no [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] is to milk the cow whose milk is to be used for the Agnihotra<ref name=fx59_ve2_950/> (‘fire-oblation’). On the other hand, in certain passages, the [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] is given a place in the Soma sacrifice,<ref name=fx60_ve2_950/> and in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx61_ve2_950/> there are given formulæ for the placing of the sacrificial fire not only for the three upper castes, but also for the '''[[रथकार|Rathakāra]],'''  ‘chariot-maker.’ Again, in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx62_ve2_950/> the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] is opposed as ‘eater of the oblation’ to the members of the other three castes.<br><br>The characteristics of the several castes are given under '''[[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]]''' and '''[[राजन्|Rājan]], [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]], [[शूद्र|Śūdra]]:''' they may be briefly summed up as follows: The [[विश्|Viś]] forms the basis of the state on which the [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] and [[क्षत्र|Kṣatra]] rest;<ref name=fx63_ve2_950/> the [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] and [[क्षत्र|Kṣatra]] are superior to the [[विश्|Viś]];<ref name=fx64_ve2_950/> while all three classes are superior to the Śūdras. The real power of the state rested with the king and his nobles, with their retainers, who may be deemed the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] element. Engaged in the business of the protection of the country, its administration, the decision of legal cases, and in war, the nobles subsisted, no doubt, on the revenues in kind levied from the people, the king granting to them villages (see '''[[ग्राम|Grāma]]''') for their maintenance, while some of them, no doubt, had lands of their own cultivated for them by slaves or by tenants. The states were seemingly small:<ref name=fx65_ve2_950/> there are no clear signs of any really large kingdoms, despite the mention of '''Mahārājas.''' The people, engaged in agriculture, pastoral pursuits, and trade ('''[[वणिज्|Vaṇij]]'''), paid tribute to the king and nobles for the protection afforded them. That, as BadenPowell suggests,<ref name=fx66_ve2_950/> they were not themselves agriculturists is probably erroneous; some might be landowners on a large scale, and draw their revenues from [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] tenants, or even Āryan tenants, but that the people as a whole were in this  position is extremely unlikely.<ref name=fx67_ve2_950/> In war the people shared the conflicts of the nobles, for there was not yet any absolute separation of the functions of the several classes. The priests may be divided into two classes--the Purohitas of the kings, who guided their employers by their counsel, and were in a position to acquire great influence in the state, as it is evident they actually did, and the ordinary priests who led quiet lives, except when they were engaged on some great festival of a king or a wealthy noble.<ref name=fx68_ve2_950/><br><br>The relations and functions of the castes are well summed up in a passage of the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx69_ve2_950/> which treats of them as opposed to the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]]. The [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] is a receiver of gifts (''ā-dāyī''), a drinker of Soma (''ā-pāyī''), a seeker of food (''āvasāyī''),<ref name=fx70_ve2_950/> and liable to removal at will (''yathākāma-prayāpyaḥ'').<ref name=fx71_ve2_950/> The [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] is tributary to another (''anyasya balikṛt''), to be lived on by another (''anyasyādyaḥ''), and to be oppressed at will (''yathākāma-jyeyaḥ'').<ref name=fx72_ve2_950/> The [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] is the servant of another (''anyasya preṣyaḥ''), to be expelled at will (''kāmotthāpyaḥ''), and to be slain  at pleasure (''yathākāma-vadhyaḥ'').<ref name=fx73_ve2_950/> The descriptions seem calculated to show the relation of each of the castes to the [[राजन्य|Rājanya]]. Even the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] he can control, whilst the [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] is his inferior and tributary, whom he can remove without cause from his land,<ref name=fx74_ve2_950/> but who is still free, and whom he cannot maim or slay without due process. The [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] has no rights of property or life against the noble, especially the king.<br><br>The passage is a late one, and the high place of the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] is to some extent accounted for by this fact. It is clear that in the course of time the [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] fell more and more in position with the hardening of the divisions of caste. Weber<ref name=fx75_ve2_950/> shows reason for believing that the [[वाजपेय|Vājapeya]] sacrifice, a festival of which a chariot race forms an integral part,<ref name=fx76_ve2_950/> was, as the [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx77_ve2_950/> says, once a sacrifice for a [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]], as well as for a priest or king. But the king, too, had to suffer diminution of his influence at the hands of the priest: the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] texts<ref name=fx78_ve2_950/> show that the [[वाजपेय|Vājapeya]] was originally a lesser sacrifice which, in the case of a king, was followed by the [[राजसूय|Rājasūya]], or consecration of him as an overlord of lesser kings, and in that of the Brahmin by the [[बृहस्पतिसव|Bṛhaspatisava]], a festival celebrated on his appointment as a royal [[पुरोहित|Purohita]]. But the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx79_ve2_950/> exalts the [[वाजपेय|Vājapeya]], in which a priest could be the sacrificer, over the [[राजसूय|Rājasūya]], from which he was excluded, and identifies it with the [[बृहस्पतिसव|Bṛhaspatisava]], a clear piece of juggling in the interests of the priestly pretentions. But we must not overestimate the value of such passages, or the exaltation of the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] in the later books of the Śatapatha  and [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] Brāhmaṇas as evidence of a real growth in the priestly power: these books represent the views of the priests of what their own powers should be, and to some extent were in the [[मध्यदेश|Madhyadeśa]]. Another side of the picture is presented in the Pāli literature,<ref name=fx80_ve2_950/> which, belonging to a later period than the Vedic, undoubtedly underestimates the position of the priests; while the Epic,<ref name=fx81_ve2_950/> more nearly contemporaneous with the later Vedic period, displays, despite all priestly redaction, the temporal superiority of the nobility in clear light.<br><br>Although clear distinctions were made between the different castes, there is little trace in Vedic literature of one of the leading characteristics of the later system, the impurity communicated by the touch or contact of the inferior castes,<ref name=fx82_ve2_950/> which is seen both directly in the purification rendered necessary in case of contact with a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]], and indirectly in the prohibition of eating in company with men of lower caste.<ref name=fx83_ve2_950/> It is true that prohibition of eating in company with others does appear,<ref name=fx84_ve2_950/> but not in connexion with caste: its purpose is to preserve the peculiar sanctity of those who perform a certain rite or believe in a certain doctrine; for persons who eat of the same food together, according to primitive thought, acquire the same characteristics and enter into a sacramental communion. But Vedic literature does not yet show that to take food from an inferior caste was forbidden as destroying  purity.<ref name=fx85_ve2_950/> Nor, of course, has the caste system developed the constitution with a head, a council, and common festivals which the modern caste has; for such an organization is not found even in the Epic or in the Pāli literature.<ref name=fx86_ve2_950/> The Vedic characteristics of caste are heredity, pursuit of a common occupation, and restriction on intermarriage.<br><br>3. ''Restrictions on Intermarriage.''--Arrian, in his ''Indica,''<ref name=fx87_ve2_950/> probably on the authority of Megasthenes, makes the prohibition of marriage between , no doubt ‘castes,’ a characteristic of Indian life. The evidence of Pāli literature<ref name=fx88_ve2_950/> is in favour of this view, though it shows that a king could marry whom he wished, and could make his son by that wife the heir appearent. But it equally shows that there were others who held that not the father's but the mother's rank determined the social standing of the son. Though Manu<ref name=fx89_ve2_950/> recognizes the possibility of marriage with the next lower caste as producing legitimate children, still he condemns the marriage of an Āryan with a woman of lower caste. The Pāraskara [[गृह्य|Gṛhya]] [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx90_ve2_950/> allows the marriage of a [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] with a wife of his own caste or of the lower caste, of a Brahmin with a wife of his own caste or of the two lower classes, and of a [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] with a [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] wife only. But it quotes the opinion of others that all of them can marry a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] wife, while other authorities condemn the marriage with a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] wife in certain circumstances, which implies that in other cases it might be justified.<ref name=fx91_ve2_950/> The earlier  literature bears out this impression: much stress is laid on descent from a [[ऋषि|Ṛṣi]], and on purity of descent;<ref name=fx92_ve2_950/> but there is other evidence for the view that even a [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] need not be of pure lineage. '''[[कवष|Kavaṣa]]''' [[ऐलूष|Ailūṣa]] is taunted with being the son of a Dāsī, ‘slave woman,’<ref name=fx93_ve2_950/> and '''[[वत्स|Vatsa]]''' was accused of being a Śūdrā's son, but established his purity by walking unhurt through the flames of a fire ordeal.<ref name=fx94_ve2_950/> He who is learned (''śuśruvān'') is said to be a [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], descended from a [[ऋषि|Ṛṣi]] (''ārṣeya''), in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā;<ref name=fx95_ve2_950/> and '''[[सत्यकाम|Satyakāma]],''' son of '''[[जबाला|Jabālā]],''' was accepted as a pupil by '''[[हारिद्रुमत|Hāridrumata]]''' [[गौतम|Gautama]], though he could not name his father.<ref name=fx96_ve2_950/> The [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx97_ve2_950/> says that knowledge is all-important, not descent. But all this merely goes to show that there was a measure of laxity in the hereditary character of caste, not that it was not based on heredity. The [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]] Saṃhitās<ref name=fx98_ve2_950/> recognize the illicit union of [[आर्य|Ārya]] and [[शूद्रा|Śūdrā]], and ''vice versa:'' it is not unlikely that if illicit unions took place, legal marriage was quite possible. The [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx99_ve2_950/> indeed, recognizes such a case in that of '''[[दीर्घतमस्|Dīrghatamas]],''' son of the slave girl Uśij, if we may adopt the description of Uśij given in the Bṛhaddevatā.<ref name=fx100_ve2_950/><br><br>In a hymn of the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx101_ve2_950/> extreme claims are put  forward for the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]], who alone is a true husband and the real husband, even if the woman has had others, a [[राजन्य|Rājanya]] or a [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]]: a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] husband is not mentioned, probably on purpose.<ref name=fx102_ve2_950/> The marriage of Brāhmaṇas with [[राजन्य|Rājanya]] women is illustrated by the cases of '''[[सुकन्या|Sukanyā]],''' daughter of king '''[[शर्यात|Śaryāta]],''' who married '''[[च्यवन|Cyavana]],'''<ref name=fx103_ve2_950/> and of '''Rathavīti's''' daughter, who married '''[[श्यावाश्व|Śyāvāśva]].'''<ref name=fx104_ve2_950/><br><br>4. ''Occupation and Caste.''--The Greek authorities<ref name=fx105_ve2_950/> and the evidence of the Jātakas<ref name=fx106_ve2_950/> concur in showing it to have been the general rule that each caste was confined to its own occupations, but that the Brāhmaṇas did engage in many professions beside that of simple priest, while all castes gave members to the Śramaṇas, or homeless ascetics. The Jātakas<ref name=fx107_ve2_950/> recognize the Brahmins as engaged in all sorts of occupations, as merchants, traders, agriculturists, and so forth. Matters are somewhat simpler in Vedic literature, where the Brāhmaṇas and Kṣatriyas appear as practically confined to their own professions of sacrifice and military or administrative functions. Ludwig<ref name=fx108_ve2_950/> sees in '''[[दीर्घश्रवस्|Dīrghaśravas]]''' in the Rigveda<ref name=fx109_ve2_950/> a Brahmin reduced by indigence to acting as a merchant, as allowed even later by the [[सूत्र|Sūtra]] literature; but this is not certain, though it is perfectly possible. More interesting is the question how far the Kṣatriyas practised the duties of priests; the evidence here is conflicting. The best known case is, of course, that of '''[[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]].''' In the Rigveda he appears merely as a priest who is attached to the court of '''[[सुदास्|Sudās]],''' king of the '''Tṛtsus;''' but in the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx110_ve2_950/> he is called a king, a descendant of '''[[जह्नु|Jahnu]],''' and the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx111_ve2_950/> refers to '''Śunaḥśepa's'''  succeeding, through his adoption by [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]], to the divine lore (''[[दैव|daiva]] veda'') of the '''Gāthins''' and the lordship of the Jahnus. That in fact this tradition is correct seems most improbable, but it serves at least to illustrate the existence of seers of royal origin. Such figures appear more than once in the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx112_ve2_950/> which knows the technical terms '''[[राजन्यर्षि|Rājanyarṣi]]''' and '''[[देवराजन्|Devarājan]]''' corresponding to the later Rājarṣi, ‘royal sage.’ The Jaiminīya [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx113_ve2_950/> says of one who knows a certain doctrine, ‘being a king he becomes a seer’ (''rājā sann ṛṣir bhavati''), and the Jaiminīya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx114_ve2_950/> applies the term [[राजन्य|Rājanya]] to a [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]. Again, it is argued that '''[[देवापि आर्ष्टिषेण|Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa]],''' who acted as [[पुरोहित|Purohita]], according to the Rigveda,<ref name=fx115_ve2_950/> for '''Śantanu,''' was a prince, as [[यास्क|Yāska]]<ref name=fx116_ve2_950/> says or implies he was.<ref name=fx117_ve2_950/> But this assumption seems to be only an error of Yāska's. Since nothing in the Rigveda alludes to any relationship, it is impossible to accept Sieg's view<ref name=fx118_ve2_950/> that the Rigveda recognizes the two as brothers, but presents the fact of a prince acting the part of [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] as unusual and requiring explanation. The principle, however, thus accepted by Sieg as to princes in the Rigveda seems sound enough. Again, Muir<ref name=fx119_ve2_950/> has argued that Hindu tradition, as shown in Sāyaṇa,<ref name=fx120_ve2_950/> regards many hymns of the Rigveda as composed by royal personages, but he admits that in many cases the ascription is wrong; it may be added that in the case of '''Pṛthī [[वैन्य|Vainya]],''' where the hymn<ref name=fx121_ve2_950/> ascribed to him seems to be his, it is not shown in the hymn itself that he is other than a seer; the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx122_ve2_950/> calls him a king, but that is probably of no more value than the later tradition as to [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]]. The case of '''Viśvantara'''  and the '''Śyāparṇas''' mentioned in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx123_ve2_950/> has been cited<ref name=fx124_ve2_950/> as that of a king sacrificing without priestly aid, but the interpretation is quite uncertain, while the parallel of the '''Kaśyapas, Asitamṛgas,''' and '''Bhūtavīras''' mentioned in the course of the narrative renders it highly probable that the king had other priests to carry out the sacrifice.<br><br>Somewhat different are a series of other cases found in the Upaniṣads, where the Brahma doctrine is ascribed to royal persons. Thus '''[[जनक|Janaka]]''' is said in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx125_ve2_950/> to have become a [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]]; '''[[अजातशत्रु|Ajātaśatru]]''' taught '''[[गार्ग्य|Gārgya]] [[बालाकि|Bālāki]];'''<ref name=fx126_ve2_950/> '''[[प्रवाहण जैवलि|Pravāhaṇa Jaivali]]''' instructed '''[[श्वेतकेतु|Śvetaketu]] [[आरुणेय|Āruṇeya]],'''<ref name=fx127_ve2_950/> as well as '''[[शिलक शालावत्य|Śilaka Śālāvatya]]'''<ref name=fx128_ve2_950/> and '''[[चैकितायन|Caikitāyana]] [[दाल्भ्य|Dālbhya]];''' and '''[[अश्वपति|Aśvapati]] [[कैकेय|Kaikeya]]''' taught Brahmins.<ref name=fx129_ve2_950/> It has been deduced<ref name=fx130_ve2_950/> from such passages that the Brahma doctrine was a product of the Kṣatriyas. This conclusion is, however, entirely doubtful,<ref name=fx131_ve2_950/> for kings were naturally willing to be flattered by the ascription to them of philosophic activity, and elsewhere<ref name=fx132_ve2_950/> the opinion of a [[राजन्य|Rājanya]] is treated with contempt.<br><br>It is probably a fair deduction that the royal caste did not much concern itself with the sacred lore of the priests, though it is not unlikely that individual exceptions occurred. But that warriors became priests, that an actual change of caste took place, is quite unproved by a single genuine example. That it was impossible we cannot say, but it seems not to have taken place. To be distinguished from a caste change, as Fick<ref name=fx133_ve2_950/> points out, is the fact that a member of any caste could, in the later period at least, become a [[श्रमण|Śramaṇa]], as is recorded in effect  of many kings in the Epic.<ref name=fx134_ve2_950/> Whether the practice is Vedic is not clear: [[यास्क|Yāska]]<ref name=fx135_ve2_950/> records it of Devāpi, but this is not evidence for times much anterior to the rise of Buddhism.<br><br>On the other hand, the Brahmins, or at least the Purohitas, accompanied the princes in battle, and probably, like the mediæval clergy, were not unprepared to fight,<ref name=fx136_ve2_950/> as [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] and [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]] seem to have done, and as priests do even in the Epic from time to time.<ref name=fx137_ve2_950/> But a priest cannot be said to change caste by acting in this way.<br><br>More generally the possibility of the occurrence of change of caste may be seen in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx138_ve2_950/> where '''[[श्यापर्ण सायकायन|Śyāparṇa Sāyakāyana]]''' is represented as speaking of his offspring as if they could have become the nobles, priests, and commons of the Śalvas; and in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx139_ve2_950/> where Viśvantara is told that if the wrong offering were made his children would be of the three other castes. A drunken [[ऋषि|Ṛṣi]] of the Rigveda<ref name=fx140_ve2_950/> talks as if he could be converted into a king. On the other hand, certain kings, such as '''[[पर आट्णार|Para Āṭṇāra]],''' are spoken of as performers of Sattras, ‘sacrificial sessions.’<ref name=fx141_ve2_950/> As evidence for caste exchange all this amounts to little; later a Brahmin might become a king, while the [[ऋषि|Ṛṣi]] in the Rigveda is represented as speaking in a state of intoxication; the great kings could be called sacrificers if, for the nonce, they were consecrated (''dīkṣita''), and so temporarily became Brahmins.<ref name=fx142_ve2_950/> The hypothetical passages, too, do not help much. It would be unwise to deny the possibility of caste exchange, but it is not clearly indicated by any record. Even cases like that of [[सत्यकाम|Satyakāma]] [[जाबाल|Jābāla]] do not go far; for ''ex hypothesi'' that teacher  did not know who his father was, and the latter could quite well have been a Brahmin.<br><br>It may therefore be held that the priests and the nobles practised hereditary occupations, and that either class was a closed body into which a man must be born. These two Varṇas may thus be fairly regarded as castes. The Vaiśyas offer more difficulty, for they practised a great variety of occupations (see '''[[वैश्य|Vaiśya]]'''). Fick<ref name=fx143_ve2_950/> concludes that there is no exact sense in which they can be called a caste, since, in the Buddhist literature, they were divided into various groups, which themselves practised endogamy such as the ''gahapatis,'' or smaller landowners, the ''setthis,'' or large merchants and members of the various guilds, while there are clear traces<ref name=fx144_ve2_950/> in the legal textbooks of a view that [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] and [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] stand opposed to all the other members of the community. But we need hardly accept this view for Vedic times, when the [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]], the ordinary freeman of the tribe, formed a class or caste in all probability, which was severed by its free status from the Śūdras, and which was severed by its lack of priestly or noble blood from the two higher classes in the state. It is probably legitimate to hold that any [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] could marry any member of the caste, and that the later divisions within the category of Vaiśyas are growths of divisions parallel with the original process by which priest and noble had grown into separate entities. The process can be seen to day when new tribes fall under the caste system: each class tries to elevate itself in the social scale by refusing to intermarry with inferior classes on equal terms--hypergamy is often allowed--and so those Vaiśyas who acquired wealth in trade ('''[[श्रेष्ठिन्|Śreṣṭhin]]''') or agriculture (the Pāli Gahapatis) would become distinct, as sub-castes, from the ordinary Vaiśyas. But it is not legitimate to regard [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] as a theoretic caste; rather it is an old caste which is in process of dividing into innumerable sub-castes under influences of occupation, religion, or geographical situation.<br><br>Fick<ref name=fx145_ve2_950/> denies also that the Śūdras ever formed a single  caste: he regards the term as covering the numerous inferior races and tribes defeated by the Āryan invaders, but originally as denoting only one special tribe. It is reasonable to suppose that [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] was the name given by the Vedic Indians to the nations opposing them, and that these ranked as slaves beside the three castes--nobles, priests, and people--just as in the Anglo-Saxon and early German constitution beside the priests, the ''nobiles'' or eorls, and the ''ingenui,'' ordinary freemen or ceorls, there was a distinct class of slaves proper; the use of a generic expression to cover them seems natural, whatever its origin (see '''[[शूद्र|Śūdra]]'''). In the Āryan view a marriage of Śūdras could hardly be regulated by rules; any [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] could wed another, if such a marriage could be called a marriage at all, for a slave cannot in early law be deemed to be capable of marriage proper. But what applied in the early Vedic period became no doubt less and less applicable later when many aboriginal tribes and princes must have come into the Āryan community by peaceful means, or by conquest, without loss of personal liberty, and when the term [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] would cover many sorts of people who were not really slaves, but were freemen of a humble character occupied in such functions as supplying the numerous needs of the village, like the '''Caṇḍālas,''' or tribes living under Āryan control, or independent, such as the '''Niṣādas.'''<br><br>But it is also probable that the Śūdras came to include men of Āryan race, and that the Vedic period saw the degradation of Āryans to a lower social status. This seems, at any rate, to have been the case with the '''Rathakāras.''' In the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx146_ve2_950/> the [[रथकार|Rathakāra]] is placed as a special class along with the Brāhmaṇas, Rājanyas, and Vaiśyas: this can hardly be interpreted except to mean that the Rathakāras were not included in the Āryan classes, though it is just possible that only a subdivision of the Vaiśyas is meant. There is other evidence<ref name=fx147_ve2_950/> that the Rathakāras were regarded as Śūdras. But in the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx148_ve2_950/> the Rathakāras and the '''Karmāras''' appear in a position of importance in connexion with the  selection of the king; these two classes are also referred to in an honourable way in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā;<ref name=fx149_ve2_950/> in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx150_ve2_950/> too, the [[रथकार|Rathakāra]] is mentioned as a a person of high standing. It is impossible to accept the view suggested by Fick<ref name=fx151_ve2_950/> that these classes were originally nonĀryan; we must recognize that the Rathakāras, in early Vedic times esteemed for their skill, later became degraded because of the growth of the feeling that manual labour was not dignified. The development of this idea was a departure from the Āryan conception; it is not unnatural, however undesirable, and has a faint parallel in the class distinctions of modern Europe. Similarly, the [[कर्मार|Karmāra]], the '''[[तक्षन्|Takṣan]],'''<ref name=fx152_ve2_950/> the Carmamna, or ‘tanner,’ the weaver and others, quite dignified occupations in the Rigveda, are reckoned as Śūdras in the Pāli texts.<ref name=fx153_ve2_950/><br><br>The later theory, which appears fully developed in the [[धर्म|Dharma]] Sūtras,<ref name=fx154_ve2_950/> deduces the several castes other than the original four from the intermarriage of the several castes. This theory has no justification in the early Vedic literature. In some cases it is obviously wrong; for example, the '''[[सूत|Sūta]]''' is said to be a caste of this kind, whereas it is perfectly clear that if the Sūtas did form a caste, it was one ultimately due to occupation. But there is no evidence at all that the Sūtas, Grāmaṇīs, and other members of occupations were real castes in the sense that they were endogamic in the early Vedic period. All that we can say is that there was a steady progress by which caste after caste was formed, occupation being an important determining feature, just as in modern times there are castes bearing names like Gopāla (‘cowherd’) [[कैवर्त|Kaivarta]] or Dhīvara (‘fisherman’), and [[वणिज्|Vaṇij]] (‘merchant’).<ref name=fx155_ve2_950/> <br><br>Fick<ref name=fx156_ve2_950/> finds in the Jātakas mention of a number of occupations whose members did not form part of any caste at all, such as the attendants on the court, the actors and dancers who went from village to village, and the wild tribes that lived in the mountains, fishermen, hunters, and so on. In Vedic times these people presumably fell under the conception of [[शूद्र|Śūdra]], and may have included the '''[[पर्णक|Parṇaka]], [[पौल्कस|Paulkasa]], [[बैन्द|Bainda]],''' who are mentioned with many others in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā and the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’). The slaves also, whom Fick<ref name=fx157_ve2_950/> includes in the same category, were certainly included in the term [[शूद्र|Śūdra]].<br><br>5. ''Origin of the Castes.''--The question of the origin of the castes presents some difficulty. The ultimate cause of the extreme rigidity of the caste system, as compared with the features of any other Āryan society, must probably be sought in the sharp distinction drawn from the beginning between the Āryan and the [[शूद्र|Śūdra]]. The contrast which the Vedic Indians felt as existing between themselves and the conquered population, and which probably rested originally on the difference of colour between the upper and the lower classes, tended to accentuate the natural distinctions of birth, occupation, and locality which normally existed among the Āryan Indians, but which among other Āryan peoples never developed into a caste system like that of India. The doctrine of hypergamy which marks the practical working of the caste system, seems clearly to point to the feeling that the Āryan could marry the [[शूद्रा|Śūdrā]], but not the [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] the Āryā. This distinction probably lies at the back of all other divisions: its force may be illustrated by the peculiar state of feeling as to mixed marriages, for example, in the Southern States of America and in South Africa, or even in India itself, between the new invaders from Europe and the mingled population which now peoples the country. Marriages between persons of the white and the dark race are disapproved in principle, but varying degrees of condemnation attach to (1) the marriage of a man of the white race with a woman of the dark race;  (2) an informal connexion between these two; (3) a marriage between a woman of the white race and a man of the dark race; and (4) an informal connexion between these two. Each category, on the whole, is subject to more severe reprobation than the preceding one. This race element, it would seem, is what has converted social divisions into castes. There appears, then, to be a large element of truth in the theory, best represented by Risley,<ref name=fx158_ve2_950/> which explains caste in the main as a matter of blood, and which holds that the higher the caste is, the greater is the proportion of Āryan blood.<br><br>The chief rival theory is undoubtedly that of Senart,<ref name=fx159_ve2_950/> which places the greatest stress on the Āryan constitution of the family. According to Senart the Āryan people practised in affairs of marriage both a rule of exogamy, and one of endogamy. A man must marry a woman of equal birth, but not one of the same ''gens,'' according to Roman law as interpreted by Senart and Kovalevsky;<ref name=fx160_ve2_950/> and an Athenian must marry an Athenian woman, but not one of the same . In India these rules are reproduced in the form that one must not marry within the '''[[गोत्र|Gotra]],''' but not without the caste. The theory, though attractively developed, is not convincing; the Latin and Greek parallels are not even probably accurate;<ref name=fx161_ve2_950/> and in India the rule forbidding marriage within the [[गोत्र|Gotra]] is one which grows; in strictness as the evidence grows later in date.<ref name=fx162_ve2_950/><br><br>On the other hand, it is not necessary to deny that the development of caste may have been helped by the family traditions of some ''gentes,'' or , or Gotras. The Patricians of Rome for a long time declined intermarriage with the plebeians; the Athenian Eupatridai seem to have kept their pure from contamination by union with lower blood; and there may well have been noble families among the Vedic Indians who intermarried only among themselves. The  Germans known to Tacitus<ref name=fx163_ve2_950/> were divided into ''nobiles'' and ''ingenui,'' and the Anglo-Saxons into eorls and ceorls, noble and non-noble freemen.<ref name=fx164_ve2_950/> The origin of nobility need not be sought in the Vedic period proper, for it may already have existed. It may have been due to the fact that the king, whom we must regard as originally elected by the people, was as king often in close relation with, or regarded as an incarnation of, the deity;<ref name=fx165_ve2_950/> and that hereditary kingship would tend to increase the tradition of especially sacred blood: thus the royal family and its offshoots would be anxious to maintain the purity of their blood. In India, beside the sanctity of the king, there was the sanctity of the priest. Here we have in the family exclusiveness of king and nobles, and the similar exclusiveness of a priesthood which was not celibate, influences that make for caste, especially when accompanying the deep opposition between the general folk and the servile aborigines.<br><br>Caste, once created, naturally developed in different directions. Nesfield<ref name=fx166_ve2_950/> was inclined to see in occupation the one ground of caste. It is hardly necessary seriously to criticize this view considered as an ultimate explanation of caste, but it is perfectly certain that gilds of workers tend to become castes. The carpenters ('''[[तक्षन्|Takṣan]]'''), the chariot-makers ('''[[रथकार|Rathakāra]]'''), the fishermen ('''[[धैवर|Dhaivara]]''') and others are clearly of the type of caste, and the number extends itself as time goes on. But this is not to say that caste is founded on occupation pure and simple in its first origin, or that mere difference of occupation would have produced the system of caste without the interposition of the fundamental difference between Āryan and [[दास|Dāsa]] or [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] blood and colour. This difference rendered increasingly important what the history of the Āryan peoples shows us to be declining, the distinction between the noble and the non-noble  freemen, a distinction not of course ultimate, but one which seems to have been developed in the Āryan people before the separation of its various branches.<br><br>It is well known that the Iranian polity presents a division of classes comparable in some respects<ref name=fx167_ve2_950/> with the Indian polity. The priests (Atharvas) and warriors (Rathaesthas) are unmistakably parallel, and the two lower classes seem to correspond closely to the Pāli Gahapatis, and perhaps to the Śūdras.<ref name=fx168_ve2_950/> But they are certainly not castes in the Indian sense of the word. There is no probability in the view of Senart<ref name=fx169_ve2_950/> or of Risley<ref name=fx170_ve2_950/> that the names of the old classes were later superimposed artificially on a system of castes that were different from them in origin. We cannot say that the castes existed before the classes, and that the classes were borrowed by India from Iran, as Risley maintains, ignoring the early [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] evidence for the four Varṇas, and treating the transfer as late. Nor can we say with Senart that the castes and classes are of independent origin. If there had been no [[वर्ण|Varṇa]], caste might never have arisen; both colour and class occupation are needed for a plausible account of the rise of caste.<ref name=fx171_ve2_950/> <br>

<u>'''Vasiṣṭha'''</u> is the name of one of the most prominent priestly figures of Vedic tradition. The seventh Maṇḍala of the Rigveda is ascribed to him; this ascription is borne out by the fact that the Vasiṣṭhas<ref name=fx1_ve2_969/> and [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]]<ref name=fx2_ve2_969/> are frequently mentioned in that Maṇḍala, besides being sometimes referred to elsewhere. That by the name [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] a definite individual is always meant is most improbable, as Oldenberg<ref name=fx3_ve2_969/> shows; [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] must normally mean simply ‘a [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]].’ But it is not necessary to deny that a real [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] existed, for one hymn<ref name=fx4_ve2_969/> seems to show clear traces of his authorship, and of his assistance to '''[[सुदास्|Sudās]]''' against the ten kings.<br><br>The most important feature of Vasiṣṭha's life was apparently  his hostility to '''[[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]].''' The latter was certainly<ref name=fx5_ve2_969/> at one time the '''[[पुरोहित|Purohita]]''' (‘domestic priest’) of [[सुदास्|Sudās]], but he seems to have been deposed from that post, to have joined Sudās' enemies, and to have taken part in the onslaught of the kings against him, for the hymn of Sudās' triumph<ref name=fx4_ve2_969/> has clear references to the ruin [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]] brought on his allies.<ref name=fx6_ve2_969/> Oldenberg,<ref name=fx7_ve2_969/> however, holds that the strife of [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]] and [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] is not to be found in the Rigveda. On the other hand, Geldner<ref name=fx8_ve2_969/> is hardly right in finding in the Rigveda<ref name=fx9_ve2_969/> a compressed account indicating the rivalry of '''[[शक्ति|Śakti]],''' Vasiṣṭha's son, with [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]], the acquisition by [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]] of special skill in speech, and the revenge of [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]], who secured the death of [[शक्ति|Śakti]] by Sudās' servants, an account which is more fully related by Ṣaḍguruśiṣya,<ref name=fx10_ve2_969/> which appeared in the Śāṭyāyanaka,<ref name=fx11_ve2_969/> and to which reference seems to be made in the brief notices of the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx12_ve2_969/> and the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx13_ve2_969/> regarding Vasiṣṭha's sons having been slain, and his overcoming the Saudāsas. But it is important to note that no mention is made in these authorities of [[सुदास्|Sudās]] himself being actually opposed to [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]], while in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx14_ve2_969/> [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] appears as the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] and consecrator of [[सुदास्|Sudās]] [[पैजवन|Paijavana]]. [[यास्क|Yāska]]<ref name=fx15_ve2_969/> recognizes [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]] as the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] of [[सुदास्|Sudās]]; this accords with what seems to have been the fact  that [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]] originally held the post. Probably, however, with the disappearance of [[सुदास्|Sudās]], [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]] recovered his position, whereupon [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] in revenge for the murder of his sons secured in some way unspecified the defeat of the Saudāsas.<ref name=fx16_ve2_969/><br><br>At any rate it is hardly necessary to suppose that the enmity of the Saudāsas and Vasiṣṭhas was permanent. There is evidence<ref name=fx17_ve2_969/> that the Bharatas had the Vasiṣṭhas as Purohitas, while other versions<ref name=fx18_ve2_969/> regard them as Purohitas for people (''prajāḥ'') generally. It seems that the Vasiṣṭhas were pioneers in adopting the rule that Purohitas should act as [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] priest<ref name=fx19_ve2_969/> at the sacrifice: the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx20_ve2_969/> states that the Vasiṣṭhas were once the only priests to act as Brahmans, but that later any priest could serve as such.<ref name=fx21_ve2_969/> A rivalry with Jamadgni and [[विश्वामित्र|Viśvāmitra]] is reported in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā.<ref name=fx22_ve2_969/> [[पराशर|Parāśara]] and [[शतयातु|Śatayātu]] are associated with [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]] in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx23_ve2_969/> being apparently, as Geldner<ref name=fx24_ve2_969/> thinks, the grandson and a son of [[वसिष्ठ|Vasiṣṭha]].

The Brahmin is said to know both;<ref name=fx9_ve2_980/> it seems best to regard the distinction not as between Sanskrit and Apabhraṃśa, as Sāyaṇa<ref name=fx10_ve2_980/> suggests, but as between the Sanskrit of the ritual and the hymns and that of ordinary life.<br><br>Reference is also made to Āryan<ref name=fx11_ve2_980/> and to Brahmin<ref name=fx12_ve2_980/> speech, by which Sanskrit, as opposed to non-Āryan tongues, seems to be meant. The '''Vrātyas''' are described as speaking the language of the initiated (''dīkṣita-[[वाच्|vāc]]''), though not themselves initiated (''a-dīkṣita''), but as calling that which is easy to utter (''a-durukta''), difficult to utter.<ref name=fx13_ve2_980/> This may mean that the non-Brahminical Indians were advancing more rapidly than the Brahminical tribes to Prākrit speech, especially if it is legitimate to connect the Vrātyas with the barbarians in speech alluded to in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx7_ve2_980/><br>

The same [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx3_ve2_983/> insists that this sacrifice is superior to the '''[[राजसूय|Rājasūya]],''' but the consensus of other authorities<ref name=fx4_ve2_983/> assigns to it merely the place of a preliminary to the '''[[बृहस्पतिसव|Bṛhaspatisava]]''' in the case of a priest, and to the '''[[राजसूय|Rājasūya]]''' in the case of a king, while the Śatapatha<ref name=fx5_ve2_983/> is compelled to identify the [[बृहस्पतिसव|Bṛhaspatisava]] with the [[वाजपेय|Vājapeya]].

There is evidence in the [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx6_ve2_983/> showing that once the festival was one which any Āryan could perform. Hillebrandt,<ref name=fx7_ve2_983/> indeed, goes so far as to compare it with the Olympic games; but there is hardly much real ground for this: the rite seems to have been developed round a primitive habit of chariot racing, transformed into a ceremony which by sympathetic magic secures the success of the sacrificer. In fact<ref name=fx8_ve2_983/> Eggeling seems correct in holding that the [[वाजपेय|Vājapeya]] was a preliminary rite performed by a Brahmin prior to his formal installation as a [[पुरोहित|Purohita]], or by a king prior to his consecration.

'''[[ऊर्णा|Ūrṇā]]'''); the god Pūṣan is called a ‘weaver of garments’ (''vāsevāya'')<ref name=fx3_ve2_1044/> because of his connexion with the fashioning of forms.

'''Adhīvāsa'''),<ref name=fx12_ve2_1044/> which was presumably a mantle, and for which the names '''Atka''' and '''[[द्रापि|Drāpi]]''' also seem to be used.

The last point would hardly accord with the usual practice in ordinary life, but seems to be a special sacrificial ritual act. A similar sort of garments in the case of women appears to be alluded to in the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx14_ve2_1044/> and the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx15_ve2_1044/> There is nothing to show exactly what differences there were between male and female costume, nor what was exactly the nature of the clothes in either case.<br><br>It is important to note that the Vedic Indian evidently assumed that all civilized persons other than inspired Munis would wear clothing of some sort.<ref name=fx16_ve2_1044/><br><br>See also '''[[वसन|Vasana]], [[वस्त्र|Vastra]], Otu, [[तन्तु|Tantu]].'''

<u>'''Vidatha'''</u> is a word of obscure sense, confined mainly to the Rigveda.

Geldner<ref name=fx7_ve2_1064/> considers that the word primarily means ‘knowledge,’ ‘wisdom,’ ‘priestly lore,’ then ‘sacrifice’ and ‘spiritual authority.’ Bloomfield,<ref name=fx8_ve2_1064/> on the other hand, insists that [[विदथ|Vidatha]] refers to the ‘house’<ref name=fx9_ve2_1064/> in the first place (from ''vid,'' ‘acquire’), and then to the ‘sacrifice,’ as connected with the house; this interpretation, at any rate, appears to suit all the passages. The term ''vidathya,'' once<ref name=fx10_ve2_1064/> applied to the king (''samrāṭ''), might seem to be against this view, but it may refer to his being ‘rich in homesteads’; and the connexion of the woman with the [[विदथ|Vidatha]], as opposed to  the '''[[सभा|Sabhā]],''' tells in favour<ref name=fx11_ve2_1064/> of Bloomfield's explanation. That the word ever denotes an asylum, like the house of the Brahmin,<ref name=fx12_ve2_1064/> as Ludwig<ref name=fx13_ve2_1064/> suggests, is doubtful.<ref name=fx14_ve2_1064/><br>

The Videhas, however, derived some fame later from the culture of their king '''[[जनक|Janaka]],''' who figures in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]]<ref name=fx2_ve2_1071/> as one of the leading patrons of the [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]] doctrine. In the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]]<ref name=fx3_ve2_1071/> the Videhas are joined with the '''Kāśis;''' in the list of peoples in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx4_ve2_1071/> the Videhas are passed over, probably because, with [[कोसल|Kosala]] and [[काशि|Kāśi]], they are included in the term '''Prācyas,''' ‘easterners.’ Again, in the [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx5_ve2_1071/> it is recorded that the [[काशि|Kāśi]], [[कोसल|Kosala]], and [[विदेह|Videha]] kingdoms had each the one [[पुरोहित|Purohita]], '''[[जल जातूकर्ण्य|Jala Jātūkarṇya]];''' and in another passage of the same text<ref name=fx6_ve2_1071/> the connexion between the [[विदेह|Videha]] king, '''[[पर आट्णार|Para Āṭṇāra]],''' and the [[कोसल|Kosala]] king, '''[[हिरण्यनाभ|Hiraṇyanābha]],''' is explained, while the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx7_ve2_1071/> speaks of [[पर आट्णार|Para Āṭṇāra]] as the [[कोसल|Kosala]] king, descendant of [[हिरण्यनाभ|Hiraṇyanābha]].<br><br>Another king of [[विदेह|Videha]] was '''[[नमी साप्य|Namī Sāpya]],''' mentioned in the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx8_ve2_1071/> In the Saṃhitās of the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]]<ref name=fx9_ve2_1071/> ‘cows of Videha’ seem to be alluded to, though the commentator on the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā merely takes the adjective ''vaidehī'' as ‘having a splendid body’ (''viśiṣṭa-deha-sambandhinī''), and the point of a place name in the expression is not very obvious.

विश्|viś|vish|విశ్|ವಿಶ್|_vei2@1105|_vei2_pn305
<u>'''Viś'''</u> is an expression of somewhat doubtful significance. In many passages of the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve2_1105/> the sense of ‘settlement’ or ‘dwelling’ is adequate and probable, since the root ''[[विश्|viś]]'' means to ‘enter’ or ‘settle.’ In other passages, where the Viśaḥ  stand in relation to a prince, the term must mean ‘subject’;<ref name=fx2_ve2_1105/> so, for example, when the people of '''[[तृणस्कन्द|Tṛṇaskanda]]'''<ref name=fx3_ve2_1105/> or of the '''Tṛtsus''' are mentioned.<ref name=fx4_ve2_1105/> Again, in some passages<ref name=fx5_ve2_1105/> the general sense of ‘people’ is adequate; as when the Rigveda speaks of the ‘Āryan people,’<ref name=fx6_ve2_1105/> or the ‘divine people,’<ref name=fx7_ve2_1105/> or the ‘Dāsa people,’ and so on.<ref name=fx8_ve2_1105/><br><br>Sometimes,<ref name=fx9_ve2_1105/> however, the [[विश्|Viś]] appear in a more special sense as a subdivision of the '''Jana''' or whole people. This is, however, not common, for in most passages one or other of the senses given above is quite possible. Moreover, it is very difficult to decide whether the [[विश्|Viś]] as a subdivision of the Jana is to be considered as being a local subdivision (canton) or a blood kinship equivalent to a clan in the large sense of the word, while the relation of the [[विश्|Viś]] to the '''[[ग्राम|Grāma]]''' or to the '''[[गोत्र|Gotra]]''' is quite uncertain. In one passage of the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx10_ve2_1105/> the Viśaḥ are mentioned along with the ''sabandhavaḥ'' or relatives, but no definite conclusion can be drawn from that fact. Nor does the analogy of the Roman ''curia'' or the Greek  throw much light, as these institutions are themselves of obscure character, and the parallelism need not be cogent. It is, at any rate, possible that the [[विश्|Viś]] may in some cases have been no more than a [[गोत्र|Gotra]] or clan, or different clans may sometirnes  have made up a [[विश्|Viś]], while [[ग्राम|Grāma]] is more definitely, perhaps, a local designation. But the Vedic evidence is quite inconclusive.<ref name=fx11_ve2_1105/> ''Cf.'' '''[[विश्पति|Viśpati]].'''<br><br>In the later period the sense of [[विश्|Viś]] is definitely restricted in some cases<ref name=fx12_ve2_1105/> to denote the third of the classes of the Vedic polity, the people or clansmen as opposed to the nobles ('''[[क्षत्र|Kṣatra]], [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]]''') and the priests ('''[[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]], [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]''').

<u>'''Viś-pati'''</u> is a word of somewhat uncertain signification, reflecting in this respect the nature of '''[[विश्|Viś]].''' Zimmer holds that in its strict sense it denotes the head of a canton, but he admits that there is no passage requiring this sense, the only one quoted by him<ref name=fx2_ve2_1108/> being certainly indecisive. In the great majority of passages the word simply means the ‘lord of the dwelling,’ whether used of a man or of the god Agni as the householder ''par excellence,'' or possibly as the fire of the '''[[सभा|Sabhā]]''' or assembly house of the people. This sense suits even the passage of the Rigveda<ref name=fx4_ve2_1108/> in which the [[विश्पति|Viśpati]], as well as the father and the mother of a maiden,<ref name=fx5_ve2_1108/> are to be lulled to sleep in order to allow her lover to approach her, for the household may well be deemed to have been a joint family, in which the [[विश्पति|Viśpati]] could easily be different from the father of the girl--''e.g.,'' a grandfather or uncle. In other passages<ref name=fx6_ve2_1108/> the [[विश्पति|Viśpati]] is the king as ‘lord of the subject-people’ (''viśām''), though here Zimmer<ref name=fx7_ve2_1108/> thinks reference is made to the election of a king.<ref name=fx8_ve2_1108/> Or again,<ref name=fx7_ve2_1108/> the [[विश्पति|Viśpati]] is the chief of the [[विश्|Viś]], probably in the sense of ‘subjects.’(**  1) ''Altindisches Leben,'' 171.(**  9) ''E.g.,'' [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 1, 3, where [[विश्|Viś]] must clearly be the people or subject class, and the [[विश्पति|Viśpati]] their chief representative; we cannot from such a passage infer a formal office of [[विश्पति|Viśpati]] even as head of the [[विश्|Viś]].<br>

This view is borne out by the Sūtras of Āpastamba<ref name=fx3_ve2_1213/> and [[बौधायन|Baudhāyana]].<ref name=fx4_ve2_1213/> Both prescribe the scale of 1,000 cows for a '''[[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]],'''<ref name=fx5_ve2_1213/> 100 for a '''[[वैश्य|Vaiśya]],''' 10 for a '''[[शूद्र|Śūdra]],''' and a bull over and above in each case. Āpastamba leaves the destination of the payment vague, but [[बौधायन|Baudhāyana]] assigns it to the king. It is reasonable to suppose that the cows were intended for the relations, and the bull was a present to the king for his intervention to induce the injured relatives to abandon the demand for the life of the offender. The Āpastamba [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx6_ve2_1213/> allows the same scale of wergeld for women, but the [[गौतम|Gautama]] [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx7_ve2_1213/> puts them on a level with men of the [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] caste only, except in one special case. The payment is made for the purpose of ''[[वैर|vaira]]-yātana'' or ''[[वैर|vaira]]-niryātana,'' ‘requital of enmity,’ ‘expiation.’<br><br>The Rigveda<ref name=fx8_ve2_1213/> preserves, also, the important notice that a man's wergeld was a hundred (cows), for it contains the epithet ''śata-[[दाय|dāya]],'' ‘one whose wergeld is a hundred.’ No doubt the values varied, but in the case of '''[[शुनःशेप|Śunaḥśepa]]''' the amount is a hundred (cows) in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]].<ref name=fx9_ve2_1213/> In the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]] Saṃhitās<ref name=fx10_ve2_1213/> ''śata-[[दाय|dāya]]'' again appears. <br><br>The fixing of the price shows that already public opinion, and perhaps the royal authority, was in Rigvedic times diminishing the sphere of private revenge; on the other hand, the existence of the system shows how weak was the criminal authority of the king (''cf.''

<u>'''Vaiśya'''</u> denotes a man, not so much of the people, as of the subject class, distinct from the ruling noble ('''[[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]]''') and the '''[[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],''' the higher strata of the Āryan community on the one side, and from the aboriginal '''[[शूद्र|Śūdra]]''' on the other. The name is first found in the [[पुरुष|Puruṣa]]-[[सूक्त|sūkta]] (‘hymn of man’) in the Rigveda,<ref name=fx1_ve2_1221/> and then frequently from the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx2_ve2_1221/> onwards,<ref name=fx3_ve2_1221/> sometimes in the form of Viśya.<ref name=fx4_ve2_1221/><br><br>The [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] plays singularly little part in Vedic literature, which has much to say of [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] and Brahmin. His characteristics are admirably summed up in the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx5_ve2_1221/> in the adjectives ''anyasya bali-kṛt,'' ‘tributary to another’; ''anyasyādya,'' ‘to be lived upon by another’; and ''yathākāmajyeyaḥ,'' ‘to be oppressed at will.’ He was unquestionably taxed by the king ('''[[राजन्|Rājan]]'''), who no doubt assigned to his retinue the right of support by the people, so that the Kṣatriyas grew more and more to depend on the services rendered to them by the Vaiśyas. But the [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] was not a slave: he could not be killed by the king or anyone else without the slayer incurring risk and the payment of a wergeld ('''[[वैर|Vaira]]'''), which even in the Brahmin books extends to 100 cows for a [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]]. Moreover, though the [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] could be expelled by the king at pleasure, he cannot be said to have been without property in his land. Hopkins<ref name=fx6_ve2_1221/> thinks it is absurd to suppose that he could really be a landowner when he was subject to removal at will, but this is to ignore the fact that normally the king could not remove the landowner, and that kings were ultimately dependent on the people, as the tales of exiled kings show.<br><br>On the other hand, Hopkins<ref name=fx7_ve2_1221/> is clearly right in holding that the [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] was really an agriculturist, and that Vedic society was not merely a landholding aristocracy, superimposed upon an agricultural aboriginal stock, as Baden Powell<ref name=fx8_ve2_1221/> urged. Without ignoring the possibility that the Dravidians were agriculturists, there is no reason to deny that the Āryans were  so likewise, and the goad of the plougher was the mark of a [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] in life<ref name=fx9_ve2_1221/> and in death.<ref name=fx10_ve2_1221/> It would be absurd to suppose that the Āryan Vaiśyas did not engage in industry and commerce (''cf.'' '''[[पणि|Paṇi]], [[वणिज्|Vaṇij]]'''), but pastoral pursuits and agriculture must have been their normal occupations.<br><br>In war the Vaiśyas must have formed the bulk of the force under the [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]] leaders (see '''[[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]]'''). But like the Homeric commoners, the Vaiśyas may well have done little of the serious fighting, being probably ill-provided with either body armour or offensive weapons.<br><br>That the Vaiśyas were engaged in the intellectual life of the day is unlikely; nor is there any tradition, corresponding to that regarding the Kṣatriyas, of their having taken part in the evolution of the doctrine of [[ब्रह्मन्|Brahman]], the great philosophic achievement of the age. The aim of the Vaiśya's ambition was, according to the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx11_ve2_1221/> to become a '''Grāmaṇī,''' or village headman, a post probably conferred by the king on wealthy Vaiśyas, of whom no doubt there were many. It is impossible to say if in Vedic times a [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] could attain to nobility or become a Brahmin. No instance can safely be quoted in support of such a view,<ref name=fx12_ve2_1221/> though such changes of status may have taken place (see '''[[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]]''' and '''[[वर्ण|Varṇa]]''').<br><br>It is denied by Fick<ref name=fx13_ve2_1221/> that the Vaiśyas were ever a caste, and the denial is certainly based on good grounds if it is held that a caste means a body within which marriage is essential, and which follows a hereditary occupation (''cf.'' '''[[वर्ण|Varṇa]]'''). But it would be wrong<ref name=fx14_ve2_1221/> to suppose that the term [[वैश्य|Vaiśya]] was merely applied by theorists to the people who were not nobles or priests. It must have been an early appellation of a definite class which was separate from the other classes, and properly to be compared with them. Moreover, though there were differences among Vaiśyas, there were equally differences among Kṣatriyas and Brāhmanas, and it is impossible to deny  the Vaiśyas' claim to be reckoned a class or caste it the other two are such, though at the present day things are different.<br><br>''Cf.''

On the other hand, Pischel<ref name=fx5_ve2_1237/> thinks that in all the passages Vrā means ‘female,’ used either of animals<ref name=fx6_ve2_1237/> or of  women who go to the feast ('''[[समन|Samana]]'''),<ref name=fx7_ve2_1237/> or courtezans (''viśyā,'' ‘of the people’),<ref name=fx8_ve2_1237/> or, metaphorically,<ref name=fx9_ve2_1237/> the hymns compared with courtezans; these senses are perhaps adequate.<br>

व्रात्य|vrātya|vraatya|వ్రాత్య|ವ್ರಾತ್ಯ|_vei2@1245|_vei2_pn342
<u>'''Vrātya'''</u> is included in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]],<ref name=fx1_ve2_1245/> where, however, no further explanation of the name is given. Fuller information is furnished by the Atharvaveda,<ref name=fx2_ve2_1245/> the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx3_ve2_1245/> and the Sūtras.<ref name=fx4_ve2_1245/> which describe at length a certain rite intended for the use of Vrātyas. According to the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]], there are four different kinds of ‘outcasts’--viz., the ''hīna,'' who are merely described as ‘depressed’; those who have become outcasts for some sin (''nindita''); those who become outcasts at an early age, apparently by living among outcasts; and those old men who, being impotent (''śama-nīcameḍhra''), have gone to live with outcasts. The last three categories are by no means of the same importance as the first. The motive of the fourth is hard to understand: according to Rājārām Rām-  krishṇa Bhāgavat,<ref name=fx5_ve2_1245/> they were men who had enfeebled their constitutions by undue intercourse with women in the lands of the outcasts, and returned home in a debilitated state. But this is not stated in the text.<br><br>It seems probable that the really important Vrātyas were those referred to as ''hīna,'' and that the other classes were only subsidiary. According to Rājārām,<ref name=fx6_ve2_1245/> there were two categories of the first class: (''a'') The depressed (''hīna''), who were nonĀryan; and (''b'') degraded Āryans (''gara-gir''). This, however, is a mere guess, and devoid of probability. There seems to have been but one class of Vrātyas. That they were non-Āryan is not probable, for it is expressly said<ref name=fx7_ve2_1245/> that, though unconsecrated, they spoke the tongue of the consecrated: they were thus apparently Āryans. This view is confirmed by the statement that ‘they call what is easy of utterance, difficult to utter’: probable they and already a somewhat Prakritic form of speech (''cf.'' '''[[वाच्|Vāc]]'''). The Sūtras mention their Arhants (‘saints’) and Yaudhas (‘warrioes’), corresponding to the Brahminical [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] and [[क्षत्रिय|Kṣatriya]].<br><br>Other particulars accord with the view that they were Āryans outside the sphere of Brahmin culture. Thus they are said<ref name=fx8_ve2_1245/> not to practise agriculture or commerce (an allusion to a nomadic life), not to observe the rules of '''[[ब्रह्मचर्य|Brahmacarya]]'''--''i.e.,'' the principle regulating the Brahminic order of life. They were also allowed to become members of the Brahminical community by performance of the ritual prescribed, which would hardly be so natural in the case of non-Āryans.<br><br>Some details are given of the life and dress of the Vrātyas. Their principles were opposed to those of the Brahmins: they beat those unworthy of correction.<ref name=fx9_ve2_1245/> Their leder (Gṛhapati) or householder wore a turbrn ('''[[उष्णीष|Uṣṇīṣa]]'''), carried a whip ('''[[प्रतोद|Pratoda]]'''), a kind of bow ('''[[ज्याह्रोड|Jyāhroḍa]]'''), was clothed in a black (''kṛṣṇaśa'') garment and two skins ('''[[अजिन|Ajina]]'''), black and white (''[[कृष्ण|kṛṣṇa]]-valakṣa''), and owned a rough vagon ('''[[विपथ|Vipatha]]''') covered with planks  (''phalakāstīrṇa''). The others,<ref name=fx10_ve2_1245/> subordinate to the leader, had garments with fringes of red (''valūkāntāni dāmatūṣāṇi''), two fringes on each, skins folded double (''dviṣaṃhitāny ajināni''), and sandals ('''[[उपानह्|Upānah]]'''). The leader wore also an ornament ('''[[निष्क|Niṣka]]''') of silver, which Rājārām<ref name=fx11_ve2_1245/> converts into a silver coinage. The Vrātyas, on becoming consecrated, were expected to hand over their goods to the priest. Many other details are given in the Sūtras (''e.g.,'' that the shoes or sandals were of variegated black hue and pointed), but these are not authenticated by the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]].<br><br>The locality in which the Vrātyas lived cannot be stated with certainty, but their nomad life<ref name=fx12_ve2_1245/> suggests the western tribes beyond the [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]]. But they may equally well have been in the east: this possibility is so far supported by the fact that the Sūtras make the Brahmin receiving the gift of the Vrātya's outfit an inhabitant of '''[[मगध|Magadha]].''' The Atharvaveda<ref name=fx13_ve2_1245/> does not help, for it treats the [[व्रात्य|Vrātya]] in so mystical a way that he is represented as being in all the quacters. Indeed, Roth<ref name=fx14_ve2_1245/> believed that it was here not a case of the [[व्रात्य|Vrātya]] of the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]] at all, but of a glorification of the [[व्रात्य|Vrātya]] as the type of the pious vagrant or wandering religious mendicant ('''[[परिव्राजक|Parivrājaka]]'''). This view is clearly wrong, as the occurrence of the words ''uṣṇīsa, [[विपथ|vipatha]],'' and ''pratoaa'' shows. It is probable that the 15th Book of the Atharvaveda, which deals with the [[व्रात्य|Vrātya]], and is of a mystical character, exalts the converted [[व्रात्य|Vrātya]] as a type of the perfect '''Brahmicārin,''' and, in so far, of the divinity.<ref name=fx15_ve2_1245/> <br>

<u>'''Śarīra,'''</u> ‘body,’ is a word of frequent occurrence in Vedic literature.<ref name=fx1_ve2_1312/> The interest of the Vedic Indians seems early to have been attracted to the consideration of questions connected with the anatomy of the body. Thus a hymn of the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx2_ve2_1312/> enumerates many parts of the body with some approach to accuracy and orderly arrangement.<ref name=fx3_ve2_1312/> It mentions the heels (''pārṣṇī''), the flesh (''[[मांस|māṃsa]]''), the ankle-bones (''gulphau''), the fingers (''aṅgulīḥ''), the apertures (''kha''), the two metatarsi (''uchlakau''), the tarsus (''[[प्रतिष्ठा|pratiṣṭhā]]''), the two knee-caps (''aṣṭhīvantau''), the two legs (''jaṅghe''), the two knee-joints (''jānunoḥ sandhī''). Then comes above the two kness (''jānū'') the foursided (''catuṣṭaya''), pliant (''śithira'') trunk (''kabandha''). The two hips (''śroṇī'') and the two thighs (''ārū'') are the props of the frame  (''kusindha''). Next come the breast-bone (''uras''), the cervical cartilages (''grīvāḥ''), the two breast pieces (''stanau''), the two shoulder-blades (''kaphoḍau''), the neck-bones (''skandhau''), and the backbones (''pṛṣṭīḥ''), the collar-bones (''aṃsau''), the arms (''bāhū''), the seven apertures in the head (''sapta khāni śīrṣaṇi''), the ears (''karṇau''), the nostrils (''nāsike''), the eyes (''cakṣaṇī''), the mouth (''mukha''), the jaws (''hanū''), the tongue (''jihvā''), the brain (''mastiṣka''), the forehead (''lalāṭa''), the facial bone (''kakāṭikā''), the cranium (''kapāla''), and the structure of the jaws (''cityā hanvoḥ'').<br><br>This system presents marked similarities with the later system of [[चरक|Caraka]] and Suśruta,<ref name=fx4_ve2_1312/> which render certain the names ascribed to the several terms by Hoernle.

The vertebral column is also denoted by ''karūkara,''<ref name=fx16_ve2_1312/> which, however, is usually found in the plural<ref name=fx17_ve2_1312/> denoting the transverse processes of the vertebræ, a sense expressed also by ''kuntāpa.''<ref name=fx18_ve2_1312/><br><br>''Grīvā,'' in the plural, denotes cervical vertebræ, the number seven being given by the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx19_ve2_1312/> but usually<ref name=fx20_ve2_1312/> the word simply means windpipe, or, more accurately, the cartilaginous rings under the skin.

The unusual consistency of his statements on this point is in favour of the word being a place name; it is also to be noted that [[कुरुक्षेत्र|Kurukṣetra]] contained the lake '''[[अन्यतःप्लक्षा|Anyataḥplakṣā]].''' Roth,<ref name=fx2_ve2_1320/> however, thought that in two passages<ref name=fx3_ve2_1320/> the word denoted merely a ‘lake,’ literally ‘(water) covered with a thicket of reeds’ (''śaryaṇa''), and in the others a Soma vessel. Zimmer<ref name=fx4_ve2_1320/> inclines to this rendering. On the other hand, Pischel<ref name=fx5_ve2_1320/> accepts Sāyaṇa's view. Hillebrandt<ref name=fx6_ve2_1320/> also sees in the word a place name, but he is inclined to locate it among the ‘five tribes,’<ref name=fx7_ve2_1320/> which is not quite inconsistent with its being in [[कुरुक्षेत्र|Kurukṣetra]], for the connexion of the '''Pūrus''' with the later '''Kurus''' is known;<ref name=fx8_ve2_1320/> or perhaps, he suggests, [[शर्यणावन्त्|Śaryaṇāvant]] is an old name for the Wular sea of Kaśmīr, which was only a reminiscence in Vedic times.

शूद्र|śūdra|shuudra|శూద్ర|ಶೂದ್ರ|shoodra|_vei2@1449|_vei2_pn388
<u>'''Śūdra'''</u> is the designation of the fourth caste in the Vedic state (see '''[[वर्ण|Varṇa]]'''). It is quite unknown in the Rigveda except in the Puruṣasūkta<ref name=fx1_ve2_1449/> (‘hymn of man’) in the tenth Maṇḍla, where is the earliest version of the origin of the castes the Śudra for the first time appears. The Rigveda, on the other hand, knows '''[[दस्यु|Dasyu]]''' and '''[[दास|Dāsa]],''' both as aborigines independent of Āryan control and as subjugated slaves: it is reasonable to reckon the [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] of the later texts as belonging to the aborigines who had been reduced to subjection by the Āryans. Strictly speaking, the defeated aborigines must have been regarded as slaves, but it is obvious that, except on occasions when most of the men were slain, which may have occurred quite often, there must have remained too many of them to be used as slaves of individual owners. The villages of the aborigines must have continued to subsist, but under Āryan lordship and control: there may be this amount of truth in Baden Powell's theory, which practically traced all the early cultivating villages in India to Dravidian origin. On the other hand, the term [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] would also cover the wild hill tribes which lived by hunting and fishing, and many of which would acknowledge the superiority of their Āryan neighbours: it could, in fact, be applied to all beyond the pale of the Āryan state.<br><br>This view of the [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] suits adequately the Vedic references to his condition, which would not apply adequately to domestic slaves only. The [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] is continually opposed to the Āryan,<ref name=fx2_ve2_1449/> and the colour of the [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] is compared with that of the Āryan,<ref name=fx3_ve2_1449/> just as his ways are so contrasted.<ref name=fx4_ve2_1449/> The [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx5_ve2_1449/> in its account of the castes, declares that the  [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] is ''anyasya [[प्रेष्य|preṣya]],'' ‘the servant of another’; ''kāmotthāpya,'' ‘to be expelled at will’; and ''yathākāmavadhya,'' ‘to be slain at will.’ All these terms well enough describe the position of the serf as the result of a conquest: the epithets might have been applied to the English serf after the Norman Conquest with but slight inaccuracy, especially if his master had received a grant of jurisdiction from the Crown. The [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx6_ve2_1449/> explains that even if prosperous (''bahu-[[पशु|paśu]],'' ‘having many cows’) a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] could not be other than a servant: his business was ''pādāvanejya,'' ‘the washing of the feet’ of his superiors. The Mahābhārata<ref name=fx7_ve2_1449/> says out and out that a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] has no property (''na hi svam asti śūdrasya,'' ‘the [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] has nothing he can call his own’). On the other hand, just as in England the royal justice would protect the serf in life and limb,<ref name=fx8_ve2_1449/> so it appears that the slaying of a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] involved a wergeld of ten cows according to both [[बौधायन|Baudhāyana]]<ref name=fx9_ve2_1449/> and Āpastamba.<ref name=fx10_ve2_1449/> It may, indeed, be held that this wergeld was only due in case of murder by another than the master, but such limitation is nowhere stated.<br><br>In sacred matters the distinction between Āryan and '''[[शूद्र|Śūdra]]''' was, of course, specially marked. The texts<ref name=fx11_ve2_1449/> do not hesitate to declare that the upper castes were ‘all,’ ignoring the Śūdras; the [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] is prohibited<ref name=fx12_ve2_1449/> from milking the cow for the milk required at the Agnihotra (‘oblation to Agni’); and the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx13_ve2_1449/> forbids a man who has been consecrated (''dīkṣita'') for a sacrifice to speak to a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] at all for the time, though the Śāṭyāyanaka<ref name=fx14_ve2_1449/> seems to have relaxed this rule by confining it to cases in which the [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] was guilty of some sin.  At the sacrifice itself the [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] could not be present in the ''[[शाला|śālā]],'' ‘hall’; he is definitely classed in the Śatapatha Brāhmáṇa<ref name=fx15_ve2_1449/> and the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx16_ve2_1449/> as unfit for ‘sacrifice’ (''ayajñiya''); and declared in the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx17_ve2_1449/> not to be admitted to drink Soma. At the Pravargya (introductory Soma) rite the performer is not allowed to come in contact with a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]],<ref name=fx18_ve2_1449/> who here, as in the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx17_ve2_1449/> is reckoned as excluded from a share in the Soma-draught. On the other hand, the [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] is one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]],<ref name=fx19_ve2_1449/> and a fight between an Āryan and a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]], in which, of course, the former wins, forms a part of the Mahāvrata rite, being perhaps a precursor of the Indian drama.<ref name=fx20_ve2_1449/><br><br>Other indications, however, exist, showing that it would be undesirable to ignore the real importance of the [[शूद्र|Śūdra]], which again reminds us of the condition of the serf, who, though legally restrained, still gradually won his way to the rank of a free man. Rich Śūdras are mentioned in the early texts,<ref name=fx21_ve2_1449/> just as [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] ''gahapatis,'' ‘householders,’ occur in the Buddhist texts, and [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] kings in the legal literature.<ref name=fx22_ve2_1449/> Sin against [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] and Āryan is mentioned;<ref name=fx23_ve2_1449/> prayers for glory on behalf of Śūdras, as well as of the other castes<ref name=fx24_ve2_1449/> occur; and the desire to be dear to [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] as well as to Āryan is expressed.<ref name=fx25_ve2_1449/> <br><br>The Sūtras also, while they emphasize as general rules points earlier not insisted on, such as their inferiority in sitting, etc.,<ref name=fx26_ve2_1449/> their exclusion from the study of the Vedas,<ref name=fx27_ve2_1449/> the danger of contact with them<ref name=fx28_ve2_1449/> or their food,<ref name=fx29_ve2_1449/> still recognize that Śūdras can be merchants,<ref name=fx30_ve2_1449/> or even exercise any trade.<ref name=fx31_ve2_1449/><br><br>Moreover, the Sūtras<ref name=fx32_ve2_1449/> permit the marriage of a [[शूद्रा|Śūdrā]] woman with members of all castes. Though it was a reproach to '''[[वत्स|Vatsa]]'''<ref name=fx33_ve2_1449/> and to '''[[कवष|Kavaṣa]]'''<ref name=fx34_ve2_1449/> that they were the sons of a [[शूद्रा|Śūdrā]] and a Dāsī respectively, still the possibility of such a reproach shows that marriages of this kind did take place. Moreover, illicit unions of [[आर्य|Ārya]] and [[शूद्रा|Śūdrā]], or [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] and Āryā, are referred to in the Saṃhitās of the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]].<ref name=fx35_ve2_1449/><br><br>The origin of the term [[शूद्र|Śūdra]] is quite obscure, but Zimmer<ref name=fx36_ve2_1449/> points out that Ptolemy<ref name=fx37_ve2_1449/> mentions  as a people, and he thinks that the Brāhui may be meant. Without laying any stress on this identification,<ref name=fx38_ve2_1449/> it is reasonable to accept the  view<ref name=fx39_ve2_1449/> that the term was originally the name of a large tribe opposed to the Āryan invasion.

<u>'''Śyāvāśva'''</u> is the name of a man mentioned several times in the Rigveda.<ref name=fx1_ve2_1494/> The Anukramaṇī (Index) assigns to him a series of hymns in the fifth, eight, and ninth books.<ref name=fx2_ve2_1494/> In one of the hymns<ref name=fx3_ve2_1494/> [[श्यावाश्व|Śyāvāśva]] mentions, apparently as his patrons, '''[[तरन्त|Taranta]]''' (a son of '''Vidadaśva''') and '''Purumīlha,''' as well as '''Rathavīti.''' On this hymn is based a legend found in the Bṛhaddevatā,<ref name=fx4_ve2_1494/> that he was the son of '''[[अर्चनानस्|Arcanānas]],''' who was sacrificing for Rathavīti [[दाल्भ्य|Dālbhya]]. The father was anxious to obtain the king's daughter for his son in marriage; but though the father was willing, his wife insisted on her son-in-law being a [[ऋषि|Ṛṣi]]. The father and son, repulsed, were returning home, when they met on the way [[तरन्त|Taranta]] and Purumīḍha, former patrons of the father. These showed him respect, while Taranta's wife, Śaśīyasī, presented [[श्यावाश्व|Śyāvāśva]] with much wealth. The son was then fortunate enough to meet the Maruts in the forest, and praised them, thus becoming a seer. As a result the king himself ultimately offered his daughter to [[श्यावाश्व|Śyāvāśva]]. Sieg<ref name=fx5_ve2_1494/> seeks to show that this legend is presupposed in the Rigveda; but it is difficult to accept this view, since the references in the Rigveda are very obscure, and Śaśīyasī is probably no more than an epithet.<ref name=fx6_ve2_1494/> That there is some [[इतिहास|Itihāsa]] at the back of the hymn is clear: what it is can hardly now be determined.<br><br>Śyāvāśva's obtaining gifts from [[वैदद्अश्वि|Vaidadaśvi]] is referred to also in the [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]].<ref name=fx7_ve2_1494/> His name occurs in the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx8_ve2_1494/> in two lists of persons, of which the former includes Purumīḍha, the latter also [[अर्चनानस्|Arcanānas]] and Atri. A Sāman is ascribed to him in the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx9_ve2_1494/> and he is perhaps referred to in the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Āraṇyaka.<ref name=fx10_ve2_1494/> In the  [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]] and the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx11_ve2_1494/> he is styled Ārcanānasa, ‘son of [[अर्चनानस्|Arcanānas]],’ and later<ref name=fx12_ve2_1494/> he is called [[आत्रेय|Ātreya]], ‘descendant of Atri.’<br>

<u>'''Śveta-ketu'''</u> Aruṇeya<ref name=fx1_ve2_1533/> (‘descendant of '''Aruṇa'''’) or '''[[औद्दालकि|Auddālaki]]'''<ref name=fx2_ve2_1533/> (‘son of '''Uddālaka'''’) is mentioned repeatedly in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] and the Chāndogya [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]]. In the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[उपनिषद्|Upaniṣad]]<ref name=fx3_ve2_1533/> he appears as [[श्वेतकेतु|Śvetaketu]], son of '''[[आरुणि|Āruṇi]],''' and as a '''[[गौतम|Gautama]].''' In the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx4_ve2_1533/> he is quoted as an authority on the vexed question of the duty of the '''[[सदस्य|Sadasya]],''' or the seventeenth priest, at the ritual of the Kauṣītakins, to notify errors in the sacrifice; [[आरुणि|Āruṇi]], his father, is also cited. He was a person of some originality, for he insisted on eating honey despite the general prohibition of the use of that delicacy by Brahmacārins or religious students.<ref name=fx5_ve2_1533/> He was a contemporary of, and was instructed by the '''[[पञ्चाल|Pañcāla]]''' king '''Pravāhaṇa [[जैवल|Jaivala]].'''<ref name=fx6_ve2_1533/> He was also a contemporary of '''[[जनक|Janaka]],''' of '''[[विदेह|Videha]],''' and figured among the Brahmin disputants at his court.<ref name=fx7_ve2_1533/> A story is told of him in the [[शाङ्खायन|Śāṅkhāyana]] Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]:<ref name=fx8_ve2_1533/> '''[[जल जातूकर्ण्य|Jala Jātūkarṇya]]''' was lucky enough to become the [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] of three peoples or kings, of '''[[काशि|Kāśi]], [[कोसल|Kosala]],''' and '''[[विदेह|Videha]].''' Seeing this, [[श्वेतकेतु|Śvetaketu]] felt annoyed and reproached his father with his excessive devotion to sacrifice, which merely enriched and glorified others, not himself. His father replied, forbidding him to speak thus: he had learned the true method of sacrificing, and his ambition in life had been to discuss it with every Brahmin.<br><br>All the references to [[श्वेतकेतु|Śvetaketu]] belong to the latest period of Vedic literature. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Āpastamba [[धर्म|Dharma]] [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx9_ve2_1533/> should refer to him as an Avara, or  person of later days, who still became a [[ऋषि|Ṛṣi]] by special merit. His date, however, must not be fixed too low, because the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] in which he plays so marked a part is certainly earlier than Pāṇini, and was apparently even in that grammarian's time believed to be an ancient work: hence 500 B.C. is probably rather too late than too early a period for [[श्वेतकेतु|Śvetaketu]] as a rough approximation to a date.<ref name=fx10_ve2_1533/><br>

<u>'''Saṃ-vatsara,'''</u> ‘year,’ is repeatedly mentioned from the Rigveda onwards.<ref name=fx1_ve2_1540/><br><br>It duration was, according to the concurrent evidence of the Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas, 360 days, divided into 12 months, being, no doubt, roughly a lunar synodic year, which, however, it exceeded in length by 6 days.<ref name=fx2_ve2_1540/> As a solar year it appears only in the [[निदान|Nidāna]] [[सूत्र|Sūtra]]<ref name=fx3_ve2_1540/> of the [[सामवेद|Sāmaveda]], where the sun is stated to spend 13(1/3) days in each of the 27 Nakṣatras. <br><br>The year being obviously out of harmony with the solar year (whether sidereal or tropical), efforts were certainly made to effect an assimilation of the natural and the accepted year. As has been seen (see '''[[मास|Māsa]]'''), the evidence goes strongly to show that the intercalation was not an easy matter in the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] period, though there are traces of what may be regarded as a five-yearly or six-yearly intercalation. But there is no conclusive evidence that these periods were really observed.<br><br>Zimmer,<ref name=fx4_ve2_1540/> indeed, considers that the evidence required is afforded by the lists of the years, which are sometimes enumerated as five: [[संवत्सर|Saṃvatsara]], [[परिवत्सर|Parivatsara]], Idāvatsara, Idvatsara, and Vatsara;<ref name=fx5_ve2_1540/> or [[संवत्सर|Saṃvatsara]], [[परिवत्सर|Parivatsara]], Idāvatsara, Iduvatsara, Vatsara;<ref name=fx6_ve2_1540/> or [[संवत्सर|Saṃvatsara]], Idāvatsara, Iduvatsara, Idvatsara, Vatsara;<ref name=fx7_ve2_1540/> or [[संवत्सर|Saṃvatsara]], [[परिवत्सर|Parivatsara]], Idāvatsara, Anuvatsara, Udvatsara;<ref name=fx8_ve2_1540/> or [[संवत्सर|Saṃvatsara]], [[परिवत्सर|Parivatsara]], Idāvatsara, Anuvatsara, Idvatsara.<ref name=fx9_ve2_1540/> But it must be noted not merely that the names vary considerably, but that four only are mentioned in some places,<ref name=fx10_ve2_1540/> in others<ref name=fx11_ve2_1540/> three, in others<ref name=fx12_ve2_1540/> two, and in yet others<ref name=fx13_ve2_1540/> six. Moreover, in none of these enumerations is there any reference to the names being connected with a system of intercalation. It is most probable that here we have no more that a mere series of priestly variations of Vatsara, based on the older and more genuine [[संवत्सर|Saṃvatsara]] and [[परिवत्सर|Parivatsara]] as variants of the simple Vatsara, ‘year.’ The key to the invention of the series is probably to be found in passages like that of the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx14_ve2_1540/> where the several '''[[चातुर्मास्य|Cāturmāsya]]''' (‘four-monthly’) sacrifices are equated  with the different years.<ref name=fx15_ve2_1540/> Particularly unjustifiable is the attempt of Zimmer to see in the two-year series a series of two years of 354 days each, with an intercalary month in the second; for the year of 354 days, as such, is not known to have existed before the [[सूत्र|Sūtra]] period.<br><br>Zimmer<ref name=fx16_ve2_1540/> also finds an attempt at intercalation in the famous 12 days in which the Ṛbhus are said to have slept in the house of Agohya.<ref name=fx17_ve2_1540/> He thinks that they represent twelve days added at the winter solstice to equate the lunar year of 354 days and the solar year of 366 days; and from the reverence paid in German antiquity to the ‘12 nights,’ he infers that this mode of intercalation is Indo-Germanic.<ref name=fx18_ve2_1540/> There can be little doubt that this view is wrong, and that the 12 days are merely the ‘reflexion of the year’ (''saṃvatsarasya pratimā'')<ref name=fx19_ve2_1540/> in the sense that they represent the twelve months, and have no relation to chronology at all.<br><br>A reference to the use of [[संवत्सर|Saṃvatsara]] alone as the fifth year of the cycle is seen by Shamasastry<ref name=fx20_ve2_1540/> in the peculiar dating of certain notices in the [[बौधायन|Baudhāyana]] Śrauta [[सूत्र|Sūtra]],<ref name=fx21_ve2_1540/> but this view is improbable.<ref name=fx22_ve2_1540/><br>

It is often mentioned in the Rigveda<ref name=fx1_ve2_1606/> and later,<ref name=fx2_ve2_1606/> but its exact character is not certain. The hall was clearly used for dicing,<ref name=fx3_ve2_1606/> presurnably when the assembly was not transacting public business: a dicer is called ''[[सभा-स्थाणु|sabhā-sthāṇu]],'' ‘pillar of the assembly hall,’ doubtless because of his constant presence there.<ref name=fx4_ve2_1606/> The hall also served, like the Homeric , as a meeting-place for social intercourse and general conversation about cows and so forth,<ref name=fx5_ve2_1606/> possibly for debates and verbal contests.<ref name=fx6_ve2_1606/><br><br>According to Ludwig,<ref name=fx7_ve2_1606/> the [[सभा|Sabhā]] was an assembly not of all the people, but of the Brahmins and '''Maghavans''' (‘rich patrons’). This view can be supported by the expressions  ''[[सभेय|sabheya]],'' ‘worthy of the assembly,’ applied to a Brahmin,<ref name=fx8_ve2_1606/> ''rayiḥ sabhāvān,'' ‘wealth fitting for the assembly,’<ref name=fx9_ve2_1606/> and so on.

Zimmer<ref name=fx12_ve2_1606/> is satisfied that the [[सभा|Sabhā]] was the meetingplace of the village council, presided over by the '''Grāmaṇī.''' But of this there is no trace whatever. Hillebrandt<ref name=fx13_ve2_1606/> seems right in maintaining that the [[सभा|Sabhā]] and the '''[[सम्इति|Samiti]]''' cannot be distinguished, and that the reference to well-born (''[[सु-जात|su-jāta]]'')<ref name=fx14_ve2_1606/> men being there in session is to the Āryan as opposed to the [[दास|Dāsa]] or [[शूद्र|Śūdra]], not to one class of Āryan as opposed to the other.

Hopkins<ref name=fx6_ve2_1626/> thinks that the [[सरयु|Sarayu]] is to be found in the west, and Ludwig<ref name=fx7_ve2_1626/> identifies it with the Kurum ('''[[क्रुमु|Krumu]]''').

<u>'''Sarasvatī'''</u><ref name=fx1_ve2_1628/> is the name of a river frequently mentioned in the Rigveda and later. In many passages<ref name=fx2_ve2_1628/> of the later texts it is certain the river meant is the modern [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]], which loses  itself in the sands of Patiala (see '''[[विनशन|Vinaśana]]'''). Even Roth<ref name=fx3_ve2_1628/> admits that this river is intended in some passages of the Rigveda. With the '''[[दृषद्वती|Dṛṣadvatī]]'''<ref name=fx4_ve2_1628/> it formed the western boundary of [[ब्रह्मावर्त|Brahmāvarta]] (see '''[[मध्यदेश|Madhyadeśa]]'''). It is the holy stream of early Vedic India. The Sūtras<ref name=fx5_ve2_1628/> mention sacrifices held on its banks as of great importance and sanctity.<br><br>In many other passages of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx6_ve2_1628/> and even later,<ref name=fx7_ve2_1628/> Roth held that another river, the '''[[सिन्धु|Sindhu]]''' (Indus), was really meant: only thus could it be explained why the [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]] is called the ‘foremost of rivers’ (''nadītamā''),<ref name=fx8_ve2_1628/> is said to go to the ocean,<ref name=fx9_ve2_1628/> and is referred to as a large river, on the banks of which many kings,<ref name=fx10_ve2_1628/> and, indeed, the five tribes, were located.<ref name=fx11_ve2_1628/> This view is accepted by Zimmer<ref name=fx12_ve2_1628/> and others.<ref name=fx13_ve2_1628/><br><br>On the other hand, Lassen<ref name=fx14_ve2_1628/> and Max Müller<ref name=fx15_ve2_1628/> maintain the identity of the Vedic [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]] with the later [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]].<ref name=fx16_ve2_1628/> The latter is of opinion that in Vedic times the [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]] was as large a stream as the Sutlej, and that it actually reached the  sea either after union with the Indus or not, being the ‘iron citadel,’ as the last boundary on the west, a frontier of the Panjab against the rest of India. There is no conclusive evidence of there having been any great change in the size or course of the [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]], though it would be impossible to deny that the river may easily have diminished in size. But there are strong reasons to accept the identification of the later and the earlier [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]] throughout. The insistence on the divine character of the river is been in the very hymn<ref name=fx17_ve2_1628/> which refers to it as the support of the five tribes, and corresponds well with its later sacredness. Moreover, that hymn alludes to the '''Pārāvatas,''' a people shown by the later evidence of the [[पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण|Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx18_ve2_1628/> to have been in the east, a very long way from their original home, if [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]] means the Indus. Again, the '''Pūrus,''' who were settled on the [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]],<ref name=fx19_ve2_1628/> could with great difficulty be located in the far west. Moreover, the five tribes might easily be held to be on the [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]], when they were, as they seem to have been, the western neighbours of the '''Bharatas''' in '''[[कुरुक्षेत्र|Kurukṣetra]],''' and the [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]] could easily be regarded as the boundary of the Panjab in that sense. Again, the ‘seven rivers’ in one passage<ref name=fx20_ve2_1628/> clearly designate a district: it is most probable that they are not the five rivers with the Indus and the '''[[कुभा|Kubhā]]''' (Cabul river), but the five rivers, the Indus and the [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]]. Nor is it difficult to see why the river is said to flow to the sea: either the Vedic poet had never followed the course of the river to its end, or the river did actually penetrate the desert either completely or for a long distance, and only in the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] period was its disappear-  ance in the desert found out. It is said, indeed, in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<ref name=fx21_ve2_1628/> that the five rivers go to the [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]], but this passage is not only late (as the use of the word '''[[देश|Deśa]]''' shows), but it does not say that the five rivers meant are those of the Panjab. Moreover, the passage has neither a parallel in the other Saṃhitās, nor can it possibly be regarded as an early production; if it is late it must refer to the later [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]].<br><br>Hillebrandt,<ref name=fx22_ve2_1628/> on the whole, adopts this view of the [[सरस्वती|Sarasvatī]],<ref name=fx23_ve2_1628/> but he also sees in it, besides the designation of a mythical stream, the later Vaitaraṇī,<ref name=fx24_ve2_1628/> as well as the name of the Arghandab in Arachosia.<ref name=fx25_ve2_1628/> This opinion depends essentially on his theory that the sixth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda places the scene of its action in Iranian lands, as opposed to the seventh Maṇḍala: it is as untenable as that theory itself.<ref name=fx26_ve2_1628/> Brunnhofer<ref name=fx27_ve2_1628/> at one time accepted the Iranian identification, but later<ref name=fx28_ve2_1628/> decided for the Oxus, which is quite out of the question.

सूर्य|sūrya|suurya|సూర్య|ಸೂರ್ಯ|soorya|_vei2@1778|_vei2_pn465
<u>'''Sūrya,'''</u> the ‘sun,’ plays a great part in Vedic mythology and religion,<ref name=fx1_ve2_1778/> corresponding with the importance of the sun as a factor in the physical life of the peninsula. In the Rigveda<ref name=fx2_ve2_1778/> the sun is normally regarded as a beneficent power, a not unnatural view in a people which must apparently have issued from the cold regions of the Himālaya mountains. Its heat is, however, alluded to in some passages of the Rigveda,<ref name=fx3_ve2_1778/> as well as referred to in the Atharvaveda and the literature of the Brāhmaṇas.<ref name=fx4_ve2_1778/><br><br>In one myth Indra is said to have vanquished [[सूर्य|Sūrya]] and to have stolen his wheel:<ref name=fx5_ve2_1778/> this is possibly a reference to the  obscuration of the sun by a thunderstorm.<ref name=fx6_ve2_1778/> The [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx7_ve2_1778/> presents a naive conception of the course of the sun, which it regards as bright on one side only, and as returning from west to east by the same road, but with the reverse side turned towards the earth, thus at night illumining the stars in heaven.<ref name=fx8_ve2_1778/> In the Rigveda<ref name=fx9_ve2_1778/> wonder is expressed that the sun does not fall.<br><br>There are several references to eclipses in the Rigveda. In one passage<ref name=fx10_ve2_1778/> Svarbhānu, a demon, is said to have eclipsed the sun with darkness, while '''Atri''' restores the light of the sun, a similar feat being elsewhere attributed to his family, the Atris.<ref name=fx11_ve2_1778/> In the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx12_ve2_1778/> '''[[राहु|Rāhu]]''' appears for the first time in connexion with the sun. Indra's defeat of [[सूर्य|Sūrya]]<ref name=fx6_ve2_1778/> may also be explained as alluding to an eclipse; in two other passages<ref name=fx13_ve2_1778/> such an interpretation seems at least probable. Ludwig<ref name=fx14_ve2_1778/> not only argues that the Rigveda knows the theory of eclipses caused by an occultation of the sun by the moon, and regards the sun as going round the earth,<ref name=fx15_ve2_1778/> but even endeavours to identify an eclipse referred to in the Rigveda with one that occurred in 1029 B.C. These views are completely refuted by Whitney.<ref name=fx16_ve2_1778/><br><br>The sun as a maker of time<ref name=fx17_ve2_1778/> determines the year of 360 days, which is the civil year and the usual year ('''[[संवत्सर|Saṃvatsara]]''') of  Vedic literature. This solar year is divided into two halves-the Uttarāyaṇa,<ref name=fx18_ve2_1778/> when the sun goes north, and the [[दक्षिणायन|Dakṣiṇāyana]],<ref name=fx19_ve2_1778/> when it goes south. There can be no doubt that these periods denote the time when the sun turns north from the winter solstice, and when it turns south from the summer solstice, for the [[कौषीतकि|Kauṣītaki]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx20_ve2_1778/> says so in perfectly clear language. The alternative theory is to regard the periods as those when the sun is in the north--''i.e.,'' when it is north of the equator, and when it is in the south, taking as points of departure the equinoxes, not the solstices; but this view has no support in Vedic literature, and is opposed to the fact that the equinoxes play no part in Vedic astronomical theory.<ref name=fx21_ve2_1778/> There are only doubtful references to the solstices in the Rigveda.<ref name=fx22_ve2_1778/><br><br>The Brāhmaṇas,<ref name=fx23_ve2_1778/> and perhaps the Rigveda,<ref name=fx24_ve2_1778/> regard the moon as entering the sun at new moon. According to Hillebrandt,<ref name=fx25_ve2_1778/> the Rigveda<ref name=fx26_ve2_1778/> recognizes that the moon shines by the borrowed light of the sun, but this seems very doubt-  ful.

The Rigveda<ref name=fx5_ve2_1784/> has also a Dānastuti (‘praise of gifts’) of '''[[प्रस्तोक|Prastoka]],'''<ref name=fx6_ve2_1784/> a [[सृञ्जय|Sṛñjaya]], who is lauded along with '''Divodāsa.''' Moreover, '''[[वीतहव्य|Vītahavya]]'''<ref name=fx7_ve2_1784/> seems to have been a [[सृञ्जय|Sṛñjaya]], though Zimmer<ref name=fx8_ve2_1784/> prefers to take the derivative word, '''[[वैतहव्य|Vaitahavya]],''' not as a patronymic, but as an epithet.<br><br>It seems probable that the Sṛñjayas and the '''Tṛtsus''' were closely allied, for Divodāsa and a [[सृञ्जय|Sṛñjaya]] prince are celebrated together,<ref name=fx9_ve2_1784/> and the Turvaśas were enemies of both.<ref name=fx10_ve2_1784/> This view is borne out by the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]],<ref name=fx11_ve2_1784/> which recognizes '''[[देवभाग श्रौतर्ष|Devabhāga Śrautarṣa]]''' as [[पुरोहित|Purohita]] of the '''Kurus''' and the Sṛñjayas. <br><br>On the other hand, some disaster certainly befel the Sṛñjayas, at least the Vaitahavyas, for they are said in the Atharvaveda<ref name=fx12_ve2_1784/> to have offended the '''Bhṛgus''' and to have ended miserably. There is, it is true, no precise confirmation of this notice, but both the [[काठक|Kāṭhaka]] Saṃhitā<ref name=fx13_ve2_1784/> and the [[तैत्तिरीय|Taittirīya]] Saṃhitā,<ref name=fx14_ve2_1784/> in independent passages, refer to the Sṛñjayas having sustained some serious loss, though the notice is in each case coupled with a ritual error, much as in the Old Testament the fate of kings depends on their devotion to Jahve or their disobedience. It is justifiable to recognize some disaster in this allusion.<br><br>The geographical position of the Sṛñjayas is uncertain. Hillebrandt<ref name=fx15_ve2_1784/> suggests that in early times they must be looked for west of the Indus with Divodāsa; he also mentions, though he does not definitely adopt, the suggestion of Brunnhofer that the Sṛñjayas are to be compared with the <ref name=fx16_ve2_1784/> of the Greeks, and to be located in Drangiana. Zimmer<ref name=fx17_ve2_1784/> is inclined to locate them on the upper Indus; but it is difficult to decide definitely in favour of any particular location. They may well have been a good deal farther east than the Indus, since their allies, the Tṛtsus, were in the '''[[मध्यदेश|Madhyadeśa]],''' and were certainly absorbed in the Kurus.<br><br>Of the history of this clan we have one notice.<ref name=fx18_ve2_1784/> They expelled '''[[दुष्टरीतु|Duṣṭarītu]] [[पौंसायन|Pauṃsāyana]],''' one of their kings, from the hereditary monarchy--of ten generations--and also drove out '''[[रेवोत्तरस्|Revottaras]] [[पाटव|Pāṭava]] [[चाक्र|Cākra]] [[स्थपति|Sthapati]],''' probably his minister, who, however, succeeded in effecting the restoration of the king, despite the opposition of the Kuru prince, '''[[बल्हिक|Balhika]] Prātīpya.''' Very probably this Kuru prince may have been at the bottom of the movement which led to the expulsion of the king and his minister. But the restoration of the king can  hardly be regarded, in accordance with Bloomfield's view,<ref name=fx19_ve2_1784/> as a defeat of the Sṛñjayas.<br>

सोम|soma|సోమ|ಸೋಮ|_vei2@1799|_vei2_pn474

Its importance is sufficiently shown by the fact that the whole of the ninth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, and six hymns in other Maṇḍalas, are devoted to its praise.<br><br>Nevertheless, little is actually known of the plant. Its twigs or shoots are described as brown (''[[बभ्रु|babhru]]''),<ref name=fx1_ve2_1799/> ruddy (''aruṇa''),<ref name=fx2_ve2_1799/> of tawny (''hari'').<ref name=fx3_ve2_1799/> Possibly its twigs hang down if the epithet '''[[नैचाशाख|Naicāśākha]]'''<ref name=fx4_ve2_1799/> refers to the plant as Hillebrandt<ref name=fx5_ve2_1799/> thinks. The shoot is called ''[[अंशु|aṃśu]],''<ref name=fx6_ve2_1799/> while the plant as a whole is called ''andhas,''<ref name=fx7_ve2_1799/> which also denotes the juice.<ref name=fx8_ve2_1799/> ''[[पर्वन्|Parvan]]''<ref name=fx9_ve2_1799/> is the stem.

Roth<ref name=fx16_ve2_1799/> held that the ''Sarcostemma acidum'' more nearly met the requirements of the case. Watt<ref name=fx17_ve2_1799/> suggested the Afghan grape as the real Soma, and Rice<ref name=fx18_ve2_1799/> thought a sugar-cane might be meant, while Max Müller and Rājendralāla [[मित्र|Mitra]] suggested that the juice was used as an ingredient in a kind of beer--''i.e.,'' that the Soma plant was a species of hop. Hillebrandt<ref name=fx19_ve2_1799/> considers that neither hops nor the grape can explain the references to Soma. It is very probable that the plant cannot now be identified.<ref name=fx20_ve2_1799/><br><br>In the [[यजुर्वेद|Yajurveda]]<ref name=fx21_ve2_1799/> the plant is purchased ere it is pressed.

It grew on a mountain, and could not be obtained by ordinary people: perhaps some special tribe or prince owned it, like the '''Kīkaṭas.'''<ref name=fx23_ve2_1799/> As it stands, the ritual performance is clearly an acquisition of the Soma from the Gandharvas (represented by a [[शूद्र|Śūdra]]), a ritual imitation of the action which may have been one of the sources of the drama. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining the real plant from a great  distance, several substitutes were allowed in the [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]] period.<ref name=fx24_ve2_1799/><br><br>The plant was prepared for use by being pounded with stones or in a mortar. The former was the normal method of procedure, appearing in the Rigveda as the usual one.

Since in these cases repeated mention is made of obtaining pre-eminence over '''Sajātas''' and Samānas, ‘equals,’ it is probable that allowance must also be made for the control over his fellow-villagers which an ambitious man could obtain (''e.g.,'' by loans), and which might end by giving him the position of a great landlord, even without the intervention of the king.<br>

चमू|camū|chamuu|చమూ|ಚಮೂ|chamoo|_vei2@1981|_vei2_pn513
<u>'''Camū.'''</u>--Oldenberg<ref name=fx1_ve2_1981/> considers that even in the dual the word denotes two vessels into which the Soma, often mixed with water in the '''[[कोश|Kośa]]''' and purified with the sieve, was poured, and that, in the plural, reference is made to these and other vessels into which the Soma was put at the various stages of the  process. '''[[कलश|Kalaśa]]''' similarly denoted either one (sing.) or several (plur.) of the vessels, the dual not being used, since the dual of '''[[चमू|Camū]]''' was reserved for the two vessels ''par excellence.'' In the later ritual the Camūs are replaced by the [[द्रोण|Droṇa]]-[[कलश|Kalaśa]] and the Pūtabhṛt, which was, however, assimilated in form and material (being made of clay, not of wood) to the Ādhāvanīya, the later name of the [[कोश|Kośa]]. The main difficulty of this theory is that it is hard to explain why [[कलश|Kalaśa]] never occurs in the dual. Geldner<ref name=fx2_ve2_1981/> falls back on the older view that in [[चमू|Camū]] (dual) the two boards of the Soma press are meant.<br>

<u>'''Dṛṣadvatī.'''</u>--The identification of this river with the Ghaggar (Macdonell, ''History of Sanskrit Literature,'' 142) seems to be wrong. It is almost certainly the modern Chitang (which is the correct spelling according to Raverty, ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,'' 61, 422), or Chitrung (Oldham, ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,'' 25, 58; ''cf.'' the sketch map opposite p. 49).

This theory is, however, most improbable, as is his explanation<ref name=fx2_ve2_2004/> of the [[ऐतरेय|Aitareya]] [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx3_ve2_2004/> reference by the theory that it portrays the various stages of the life of the Āryans.<br>

Sten Konow,<ref name=fx2_ve2_2012/> however, considers that Paiśācī was the speech used in the Vindhya region. It would be unwise, as a matter of fact, to lay stress on the phrase ''he 'lavo,'' because both the reading and the sense are by no means certain.<ref name=fx3_ve2_2012/> But it should be noted that the easterners and the Asuras are elsewhere in the Śatapatha [[ब्राह्मण|Brāhmaṇa]]<ref name=fx4_ve2_2012/> connected: this tells against Dr. Grierson's view.<br>
