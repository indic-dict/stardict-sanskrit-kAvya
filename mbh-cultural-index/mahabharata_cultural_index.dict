Ed. 5. 22. 12: uttarān kurūn himācalād apy udagdeśān svargabhūmirūpān); they are once distinguished from the southern Kurus (i. e. the Kuru country) 1. 102. 10. 

  B.   Description: Holy (puṇya) 6. 8. 2; 13. 54. 16; delightful (ramya) 13. 105. 25; where Siddhas live (siddhaniṣevita) 6. 8. 2; abode of those who have done meritorious acts (kṛtapuṇyapratiśraya) 6. 7. 11.

  D.   Characteristics: (1) The trees in the Uttara Kurus have sweet and juicy fruits and fragrant flowers; they bear fruits and flowers in all seasons; some trees give any kind of fruit according to one's desire and others always yield milk which has six flavours and is like amṛta; they also produce garments and ornaments from their fruits; jewelled ground in the Uttara Kurus is spread over with thin golden sand; it is everywhere pleasant to touch and is free from mud; men who fall down from the world of gods are born there; both men and women there have similar form and virtues; they are born in pairs; the women are comparable with apsaras; they drink milk, which is like amṛta, of the milk-producing trees; since they are born in pairs, they grow up together, are similar in form and virtues and wear similar dress; they love each other like the cakravāka birds; they are always happy and live ten thousand and ten hundred years; free from disease, they are not afflicted by sorrow; they never abandon each other; when they die, very strong Bhāruṇḍa birds, having sharp beaks, carry them away and throw them in valleys; (this is a short description of the Uttarakurus given by Saṁjaya to Dhṛtarāṣṭra) (uttarā kuravo rājan…/tatra vṛkṣā madhuphalā nityapuṣpaphalopagāḥ/puṣpāṇi ca sugandhīni rasavanti phalāni ca//sarvakāmaphalās tatra kecid vṛkṣā janādhipa/apare kṣīriṇo nāma vṛkṣās tatra narādhipa//ye kṣaranti sadā kṣīraṁ ṣaḍrasaṁ hy amṛtopamam/ vastrāṇi ca prasūyante phaleṣv ābharaṇāni ca//sarvā maṇimayā bhūmiḥ sūkṣmakāñcanavālukā/sarvatra sukhasaṁsparśā niṣpaṅkā ca janādhipa//devalokacyutāḥ sarve jāyante tatra mānavāḥ/tulyarūpaguṇopetāḥ sameṣu viṣameṣu ca//mithunāni ca jāyante striyaś cāpsarasopamāḥ/teṣāṁ te kṣīriṇāṁ ksīram pibanty amṛtaśaṁnibham//mithunaṁ jāyamānaṁ vai samaṁ tac ca pravardhate/tulyarūpaguṇopetaṁ samaveṣaṁ tathaiva ca/ekaikam anuraktaṁ ca cakravākasamaṁ vibho//nīrāmayā vītaśokā nityaṁ muditamānasāḥ/ daśa varṣasahasrāṇi daśa varṣaśatāni ca/ jīvanti te mahārāja na cānyonyaṁ jahaty uta//bhāruṇḍā nāma śakunās tīkṣṇatuṇḍā mahābalāḥ/te nirharanti hi mṛtān darīṣu prakṣipanti ca//uttarā kuravo rājan vyākhyātās te samāsataḥ/) 6. 8. 2-12; (2) The juicy fruits of the Jambū tree called Sudarśana, falling on ground, give rise to a river which, after encircling the Meru mountain, flows to the Uttarakurus; the men living in the Uttarakurus happily drink that juice and hence oldage never overtakes them (tasmin phalarase pīte na jarā bādhate ca tān) 6. 8. 23-24; (3) At the birth of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and Vidura, the people of the Kuru country became so prosperous and happy that they are said to have vied with the people of the Uttara Kurus (uttaraiḥ kurubhtḥ sārdhaṁ dakṣiṇāḥ kuravas tadā/vispardhamānā vyacaran) 1. 102. 10; (4) In the Uttarakurus, Brāhmaṇas who are not born the natural way, i. e. whose origin is in the fire or mountain, delight with gods (devaiḥ sārdhaṁ modamānā narendra/yatrāgniyaunāś ca vasanti viprā hy ayonayaḥ parvatayonayaś ca) 13. 105. 25 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 102. 25: agniyaunā dhṛṣṭadyumnavad agnir eva yaunaṁ yonir yeṣāṁ te); (5) King Kuśika having seen the golden palace, looking like the Gandharvanagara, and the wonderful forest created by sage Cyavana wondered whether he was bodily transferred to the land of the Uttarakurus (aho saha śarīreṇa prāpto 'smi paramāṁ gatim/uttarān vā kurūn puṇyān) 13. 54 16, 1-2; (6) Indra showers all wishes on this land (yatrottarāḥ kuravo…yatra śakro varṣati sarvakāmān) 13. 105. 25-26; (7) The gate-keepers of Harivarṣa told Arjuna that those were the lands of the Uttarakurus and he could not conquer their town; one who entered it did not remain a man: no wars were fought on the lands of Uttarakurus; even if Arjuna entered the land he would not be able to see anything, since no one with a human body could see anything there (tata enaṁ …dvārapālā samāsādya…vacanam abruvan//pārtha nedaṁ tvayā śakyaṁ puraṁ jetuṁ kathaṁcana/…idaṁ puraṁ yaḥ praviśed dhruvaṁ sa na bhaven naraḥ/… uttarāḥ kuravo hy ete nātra yuddhaṁ pravartate//praviṣṭaś cāpi kaunteya neha drakṣyasi kiṁcana/na hi mānuṣadehena śakyam atrābhivīkṣitum//) 2. 25. 8-12; (8) Formerly, women were not closeted (in four walls), they moved as they liked, and were independent; they united with men other than their husbands since their marriage as virgins, and in ancient times that was not adharma, but dharma; that ancient dharma, favourable to women, was still practised by people of the Uttara Kurus (anāvṛtāḥ kila purā striya āsan varānane/kāmacāravihāriṇyaḥ svatantrāś cārulocane//tāsāṁ vyuccaramāṇānām kaumārāt subhage patīn/nādharmo 'bhūt varārohe sa hi dharmaḥ purābhavat// …purāṇadṛṣṭo dharmo 'yam…uttareṣu ca rambhoru kuruṣv adyāpi vartate//) 1. 113. 4-5, 6-7; (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 122. 4: anāvṛtāḥ sarvair draṣṭuṁ yogyāḥ/kāmacāro ratisukhaṁ tadarthaṁ vihāriṇyaḥ paryaṭanaśīlāḥ svatantrāḥ bhartrādibhir anivāryāḥ/); where women behaved as they liked, where men and women were not envious (yatra striyaḥ kāmacārāś caranti/ yatra cerṣyā nāsti nārīnarāṇām) 13. 105. 26. 

  E.   Epic events: (1) Pāṇḍu told Kuntī that the ancient dharma, applicable to married women, was still followed among the Uttarakurus 1. 113. 7 (see above 

  D.   Characteristics: No. 7). (2) The gatekeepers of Harivarṣa did not allow Arjuna to enter the town (see above 

  D.   Characteristics No. 6); they advised Arjuna to return; he then told gate-keepers that he would not enter the land that was prohibited for human beings; he however asked for tribute for Yudhiṣṭhira's Rājasūya sacrifice; the gate-keepers then gave Arjuna heavenly garments, ornaments and animal- and deer-skins (na pravakṣyāmi vo deśaṁ bādhyatvaṁ yadi mānuṣaiḥ/yudhiṣṭhirāya yat kiṁcit karavan naḥ pradīyatām//tato divyāni vastrāṇi divyāny ābharaṇāni ca/ mokājināni divyāni tasmai te pradaduḥ karam//) 2. 25. 15-16; Dhṛtarāṣṭra referred to Arjuna's conquering the northern direction and the Uttarakurus and making them pay tribute; he also said that Arjuna brought wealth from them and made them join his army (which is not reported earlier in 2. 25. 15-16) (diśam udīcīm api cottarān kurūn gāṇḍīvadhanvā…jigāya/dhanaṁ caiṣām āharat savyasācī senānugān balidāṁś caiva cakre) 5. 22. 12; (3) Flowers, brought down by waters flowing from Uttarakurus, were brought for making garlands as tribute to Yudhiṣṭhira by the mountain peoples (uttarebhyaḥ kurubhyaś cāpy apoḍhaṁ mālyam ambubhiḥ/…pārvatīyā baliṁ cānyam āhṛtya praṇatāḥ sthitāḥ) 2. 48. 6-7; (4) The Pāṇḍavas on their way to Gandhamādana crossed the Uttarakurus and saw the Kailāsa mountain and the āśrama of Nara and Nārāyaṇa in its vicinity (te vyatītya…uttarāṁś ca kurūn api/dadṛśur…kailāsam…//tasyābhyāśe tu dadṛśur naranārāyaṇāśramam) 3. 145. 15-16; (5) After the miracle of the meeting of the dead warriors with their living relatives, brought about by Vyāsa, the dead returned to the place from where they came; some of them returned to the Uttarakurus (svāni sthānāni bhejire// ...kecic cāpy uttarān kurūn) 15. 41. 13, 15. 

  F.   Past events: The sage Gautama offered king Dhṛtarāṣṭra (who was really Indra) the world of the Uttarakurus in lieu of his elephant but the latter refused to return the elephant and accept the Uttarakurus (yatrottarāḥ kuravo bhānti ramyā…tatra tvāhaṁ hastinaṁ yātayiṣye//…paraṁ gantā dhṛtarāṣṭro na tatra) 13. 105. 25-26, 28; (2) In the long, twelve-yearly sacrifice of the sage Agastya, when a difficulty arose due to famine, the sage just said that whatever wealth was found in the Uttarakurus all that should appear of its own accord at the place of his sacrifice, and it happened just as he said (uttarebhyaḥ kurubhyaś ca yat kiṁcid vasu vidyate/sarvaṁ tad tha yajñe me svayam evopatiṣṭhatu/…ity ukte sarvam evaitad abhavat tasya dhīmataḥ) 14. 95. 25-26.

  D.   Agni's desire to burn the forest: Agni approached Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna to seek their help in fulfilling his desire to burn the Khāṇḍava; since Indra's friend Takṣaka lived in the forest, he foiled all Agni's earlier attempts to burn it 1. 215. 1-12; 1. 223. 25; 3. 46. 40; 4. 34. 14; 

  E.   Arjuna's request for weapons: Hearing Agni's request Arjuna asked for suitable weapons for himself and Kṛṣṇa so that both of them could foil Indra's attempt to pour water on the great forest 1. 215. 13-18; this was arranged by Agni 1. 216. 1-27. 

  F.   Burning of the forest: The burning described 1. 216. 33-34; 1. 217-219; 1. 220. 32; the burning was so frightful that it appeared as if the end of Aeon had set in (dadāha khāṇḍavaṁ kruddho yugāntam iva darśayan) 1. 216. 32.

  H.

Ed. 13. 26. 28: gātrāṇī asthīni), when thrown in the Gaṅgā come in contact with its water are not thrown out of heaven (na punas teṣāṁ tyāgaḥ svargād vidhīyate) 13. 27. 27; those beings whose obsequies (kṛtyāni) are performed with the water of the Gaṅgā remain permanently in the heaven (divi tiṣṭhanti te 'calāḥ) 13. 27. 28; also cf. 13. 27. 31, 36, 64; (8) The country through which the Gaṅgā flows is as good as a penance grove; a place along the river Gaṅgā is to be looked upon as the place of the Siddhas (yatra gaṅgā mahārāja sa deśas tat tapovanam/siddhakṣetraṁ tu taj jñeyaṁ gaṅgātīrasamāśritam//) 3. 83. 83; the countries (deśāḥ), the Janapadas, the āśramas, the mountains through which the Bhāgīrathī Gaṅgā, the best among the rivers, flows excel in holiness (prakṛṣṭāḥ puṇyataḥ) 13. 27. 24-25 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 26. 18: deśāḥ bhūmibhāgāḥ janapadāḥ mahājananivāsasthānāni āśramāḥ ṛṣisthānāni); the countries and the quarters which do not enjoy the benefit of the auspicious water of the Gaṅgā are like nights without the moon and trees without flowers 13. 27. 33; also cf. 13. 27. 34-35; (9) Many tīrthas on the river Gaṅgā: (i) Daśāśvamedhika 3. 83. 82; (ii) Brahmaśiras 13. 26. 38; (iii) Mārkaṇḍeyatīrtha 3. 82. 70; (iv) Aśvatīrtha 13. 4. 17; (v) Prayāga 3. 83. 69, 71; (vi) Daṇḍārka (?) 3. 82. 142; (also see the next section: Importance). 

  D.   Importance: (i) Sages and gods pay homage to Nārāyaṇa on the river Gaṅgā 3. 88. 18; (ii) Gaṅgā is listed by Mārkaṇḍeya among rivers famous as mothers of fire-hearths, i. e. sacrifices were performed on their banks (gaṅgā ca…/etā nadyas tu dhiṣṇyānāṁ mātaro yāḥ prakīrtitāḥ//) 3. 212. 24 (for Nī. see  Kapilā ); (iii) Gaṅgā, and all the Gaṅgās, listed by Saṁjaya among rivers which are called mothers of the univere 6. 10. 13; (sarvā gaṅgāś ca māriṣa/viśvasya mātaraḥ sarvāḥ) 6. 10. 35; (iv) Finds place twice in the Daivata-Ṛṣi-Vaṁśa 13. 151. 7, 15, 2; (v) Worlds which one gets by adoring with faith and devotion the virtues of the Jāhnavī were created by Gaṅgā herself (gaṅgākṛtān acireṇaiva lokān yatheṣṭam iṣṭān vicariṣyasi tvam); such a person became famous in the three worlds and achieved perfection which was difficult to obtain 13. 27. 98-99; (vi) The narration of the great importance and virtues of the Gaṅgā is called a holy Itihāsa containing the praise of the river; one who recites it, or listens to it, is freed of all sins (itihāsam imaṁ puṇyaṁ śṛṇuyād yaḥ paṭheta vā/gaṅgāyāḥ stavasaṁyuktaṁ sa mucyet sarvakilbiṣaiḥ) 13. 27. 105; (vii) Virtues of the river Gaṅgā are countless; no one can fully describe or determine them (vaktuṁ śakyaṁ neha gaṅgājalānāṁ guṇākhyānaṁ parimātuṁ tathaiva) 13. 27. 97, 96; (viii) Gaṅgā offered shelter, protection, support to those who are without it 13. 27. 44; Lomaśa invoked the blessings of the Gaṅgā, besides those of Varuṇa, Yama, and the Yamunā, on Yudhiṣṭhira and requested her to protect him from the mountains which he was about to enter while on his way to the Gandhamādana 3. 140. 13-14; (ix) Grief due to separation from the Gaṅgā more unbearable than from near relatives or wealth; on the other hand, just the sight of the Gaṅgā is more pleasing than that of the desired objects or sons 13. 27. 74-76; (x) Gaṅgā offers sustenance to those who depend on her 13. 27. 51-52; (11) Relationship with other rivers: (i) Tripathagā Gaṅgā looked upon as the first to be created among the rivers (tathā tripathagā gaṅgā nadīnām agrajā smṛtā) 14. 44. 13; (ii) among the Vibhūtis of the Bhagavān, Jāhnavī is said to be the best among the rivers (srotasām asmi jāhnavī) 6. 32. 31; also cf. 13. 27. 50; (iii) the Gaṅgā has the same relationship to other rivers as the sun has to other luminaries (?) in the sky, the moon to the manes, and the king (?) to men (divi jyotir yathādityaḥ pitṝṇāṁ caiva candramāḥ/deveśaś ca yathā nṝṇāṁ gaṅgeha saritāṁ tathā//) 13. 27. 73 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 26. 74: divi devānām iti śeṣaḥ/deveśaḥ rājendraḥ); (12) Service to deities: Gaṅgā is mentioned among those rivers who wait on Śiva for his ablutions (upasparśanahetos tvā samīpasthā upāsate) 13. 134. 12, 17; the Bhāgīrathī is one of the rivers who wait upon Varuṇa in his sabhā 2. 9. 17; (13) Limitation: Bhagīratha told Brahmadeva that his stay even for a hundred years on the bank of the Jāhnavī, practising austerities and giving as gift a thousand mules and a host of maidens (adāṁ ca tatrāśvatarīsahasraṁ nārīpuram) was not enough to take him to the Brahmaloka which was beyond the world of the gods, the cows and the sages 13. 106. 10, 5. 

  E.   Epic events related to the Gaṅgā: (1) Marriage with Saṁtanu and birth of Bhīṣma: King Pratīpa once went to the bank of the Gaṅgā (gaṅgātīragataḥ) and sat down for many years muttering prayers (japan) 1. 92. 1; Gaṅgā, in the form of a beautiful woman, rose from the waters and sat on the right thigh of king Pratīpa 1. 92. 2-3; when asked by the king what he might do to please her she requested him to make love with her (tvām ahaṁ kāmaye rājan kuruśreṣṭha bhajasva mām) 1. 92. 4-5; but, at the king's suggestion, she agreed to be his daughter-in-law and disappeared 1. 92. 9-12, 15-16; she laid down the condition that the king's son (her future husband) should not know her identity and should never question the propriety of her actions (sa me nābhijanajñaḥ syād ācareyaṁ ca yad vibho/tat sarvam eva putras te na mīmāṁseta karhicit) 1. 92. 13-14; king Śāṁtanu, son of Pratīpa, once went for hunting on the bank of the Gaṅgā; the river appeared before him in the form of a beautiful woman 1. 92. 25-26; when Śaṁtanu requested her to be his wife she agreed on condition that he did not prevent her from doing anything, auspicious or otherwise (śubhaṁ vā yadi vāśubham); should the king question her, she whould abandon him 1. 92. 31-35; when the king consented, she, full of lustre, attended on him as his wife 1. 92. 39-40; Gaṅgā, as the wife of Śaṁtanu, gave birth to eight sons seven of whom, as soon as they were born, she threw away in the waters of the river Gaṅgā; the king did not object to her on the first seven occasions, but on the eighth occasion he asked her to spare him a son; he also wanted to know who she really was 1. 92. 44-47; when thus questioned, she told Śaṁtanu that she was the river Gaṅgā, the daughter of Jahnu, and that she lived with him to achieve some purpose of the gods (devakāryārthasiddhyartham 1. 92. 49); the eight sons she bore him were the eight Vasus who were born as human beings due to the curse of Vasiṣtha; she had promised the Vasus that she would release them from their human birth as soon as they were born (cf. 1. 93. 40); she blessed the king before her departure (svasti te 'stu gamiṣyāmi); she told the king that she had lived with the Vasus (while they were in her womb) in succession (eṣa paryāyavāso me vasūnāṁ saṁnidhau kṛtaḥ) and that the eighth son who was to be given to him later by her was the one born of her (Gaṅgā) (matprasūtaṁ vijānīhi gaṅgādattam imaṁ sutam) 1. 92. 48-55; Śaṁtanu asked Jāhnavī who was Āpava (Vasiṣṭha) and what fault the Vasus had committed to invite the curse of Vasiṣṭha; he also asked why the eighth son (Gaṅgādatta) was required to live long among human beings 1. 9. 1-3; Gaṅgā Jāhnavī then told the king the whole story 1. 93. 5-42; Gaṅgā then disappeared taking the last-born son with her 1. 93. 43; many years later, King Śaṁtanu, while once hunting along the river Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī, noticed that the river had little water (alpajalām 1. 94. 21) and was not flowing as before (syandate kiṁ nv iyaṁ nādya 1. 94. 22); trying to find out the cause of it the king saw a young boy who had covered waters of the entire Gaṅgā with his arrows 1. 94. 24-25; Śaṁtanu suspected the boy to be his son and hence asked Gaṅgā to show herself to him; Gaṅgā appeared before the king holding the boy in her right hand, but the king did not immediately recognize her; Gaṅgā handed over the son to the king 1. 94. 28-31, 36; Śaṁtanu's marriage with Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī and the birth of Devavrata by her mentioned in 1. 57. 76; 1. 90. 50; 5. 179. 5; 12. 38. 8; 12. 46. 15; the birth of the Vasus from Bhāgīrathī in the house of Śaṁtanu mentioned in 1. 2. 78; 1. 61. 68; (2) Her role in Bhīṣma's fight with Rāma Jāmadagnya: When the fight between Bhīṣma and Rāma Jāmadagnya was imminent, the latter threatened to kill Bhīṣma so that Jāhnavī might see him lying on the bed of arrows and the daughter of Bhagīratha (Gaṅgā), who gave birth to him, might weep seeing him dead 5. 179. 3-5; when Bhīṣma was ready to fight with Rāma, his mother appeared before him in her original form (svarūpiṇī) to try to dissuade Bhīṣma from the fight, and expressed her readiness to go to Jāmadagnya to beg him not to engage Bhīṣma, who was his pupil, in fight; Bhīṣma then told her the incidents which had led to the fight; then the river (Gaṅgā) went to Rāma to dissuade him; when told that it was Bhīṣma who was to be dissuaded, Gaṅgā returned to Bhīṣma and again pleaded with him; but Bhīṣma, angered, did not agree to her request 5. 179. 22-30; Bhāgīrathī again appeared later in this event when she joined the sages, Nārada and others, who stood between Bhīṣma and Rāma to stop them fighting with each other 5. 186. 27; (3) Her pleading with Ambā: Gaṅgā, the mother of Bhīṣma, rose from the waters and asked Ambā the purpose she wanted to achieve by performing the austerities; when told by Ambā that her effort was aimed at the destruction of Bhīṣma, Gaṅgā (sāgaragā) told her that her purpose was crooked (jihmaṁ carasi bhāmini); if she persisted in observing her vows and if she died during the observance of the vows she would become a crooked river having water only during the rainy season and not in the remaining eight months (nadī bhaviṣyasi śubhe kuṭilā vārṣikodakā/…vārṣikī nāṣṭamāsikī); Bhīsma's mother then returned from the place where Ambā practised austerities 6. 187. 29-36; (4) Death of Bhīṣma: When Bhīṣma, after his fall on the battle-field, resolved to hold his life till the start of the Uttarāyaṇa, Gaṅgā, knowing his resolve, sent to him the great sages in the form of swans 6. 114. 90; much later, after the cremation of Bhīṣma, Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the rest, including Vyāsa, Nārada, Asita and Kṛṣṇa, went to the bank of the Bhāgīrathī and all the Kṣatriya warriors and citizens offered water offerings to him; then Bhāgīrathī arose from water and, crying, lamented the death of her son; she addressed her words to the Kauravas praising and recounting the good qualities of Bhīṣma 13. 154. 17-26; the grieved Bhāgīrathī was consoled by Dāmodara (Kṛṣṇa) assuring her that her son was brought down from the chariot by Arjuna and not by Śikhaṇḍin and that he had returned to the Vasus in heaven 13. 154. 27-32; Bhāgīrathī then gave up grief and entered her own waters; Kṛṣṇa and others, after honouring the river (satkṛtya te tāṁ saritam) returned from that place (to Hāstinapura) when permitted by her to do so (anujñātās tayā) 13. 154. 33-34; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra had offered water offerings to Bhīṣma, Yudhiṣṭhira came out of water with Dhṛtarāṣṭra and, grief-stricken, fell on the bank of the Gaṅgā 14. 1. 1-2; (5) Arjuna punished for his role in the fall of Bhīṣma: Ulūpī told Arjuna that his defeat at the hands of his son Babhruvāhana was an expiation (niṣkṛtiḥ) he had to undergo for the adharma committed by him in bringing about the fall of Bhīṣma 14. 82. 8; this expiation was prescribed by the Vasus and the Gaṅgā (eṣā tu vihitā śāntiḥ putrād yāṁ prāptavān asi/vasubhir vasudhāpāla gaṅgayā ca mahāmate) 14. 82. 11; when Bhīṣma died (hate śāntanave nṛpe) the Vasus emerged from waters and meeting the great river, told her that they wanted to curse Arjuna for his misdeed in the war, to which Bhāgīrathī agreed (idam ūcur vaco ghoraṁ bhāgīrathyā mate tadā//…vayam apy arjunaṁ…śāpena yojayāmeti tathāstv iti cābravīt//) 14. 82. 12-15; (6) The Pāṇḍavas came across the Gaṅgā at various places: (i) When Yudhiṣṭhira and his brothers decided to go on a pilgrimage, the Brāhmaṇas expressed their wish to visit with them the Gaṅgā and other rivers 3. 91. 10; when they arrived at Prayāga at the confluence of the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā the Pāṇḍavas bathed in their waters (āplutya gātrāṇi), practised the severest austerities and gave gifts to the Brāhmaṇas 3. 93. 5-6; (ii) They again arrived at the Bhāgīrathī flowing by the side of the Agastyāśrama where Lomaśa advised them to bathe at will (yatheṣṭam avagāhyatām) 3. 97. 27; (iii) Going further from the river Kauśikī, they arrived at the place where the Gaṅgā met the ocean and bathed there in waters of five hundred rivers (nadīśatānāṁ pañcānāṁ madhye cakre samāplavam) 3. 114. 2; (iv) On reaching the vicinity of the Maināka mountain, Lomaśa showed the river Gaṅgā to Yudhiṣṭhira; he advised Yudhiṣṭhira to bathe in the Gaṅgā to be freed of all sins; he also advised him to bathe silently (tūṣṇīṁ gaṅgām…samupaspṛśa) 3. 135. 5-7; (v) When the Pāṇḍavas had crossed the Uśīrabīja, the Maināka, the Śvetagiri and the Kālaśaila mountains, Lomaśa showed them the Gaṅgā flowing in seven currents (eṣā gaṅgā saptavidhā) 3. 140. 1-2; Lomaśa could hear the sound of the Gaṅgā on the top on the mountain Jāmbūnada 3. 140. 14; (vi) The Pāṇḍavas saw the Bhāgīrathī on the Kailāsa mountain; they lived there giving offerings to gods and manes again and again 3. 145. 37, 40, 42; (7) Some events after the war and the funeral rites offered to the dead: (i) When Yudhiṣṭhira went to meet Dhṛtarāṣṭra who had left Hāstinapura, he saw the Kaurava women lamenting on the bank of the Gaṅgā 11. 11. 5; (ii) Vyāsa, who knew that Gāndhārī would curse the Pāṇḍavas in their first meeting with her after the war, hastened to them after bathing (upaspṛśya) in the Gaṅgā 11. 13. 4; (iii) After lifting the funeral pyre of Droṇa, his pupils, keeping Kṛpī in the front, proceeded to the Gaṅgā 11. 23. 42; (iv) After arranging for the cremation of all the heroes who fell in the war, Yudhiṣṭhira, accompanied by Dhṛtarāṣṭra, went towards the Gaṅgā 11. 26. 44; on reaching the Gaṅgā, Yudhiṣṭhira and the Kaurava women offered water offerings to the departed (pracakruḥ salilakriyāḥ); at that moment the Gaṅgā became easily fordable spreading herself out widely (sūpatīrthābhavad gaṅgā bhūyo viprasasāra ca); the bank of the Gaṅgā then was without joy and merriment (nirānandam anutsavam …gaṅgātīram aśobhata) 11. 27. 1-5; (v) Yudhisṭhira, after giving water offerings to Karṇa (cakārāsyodakaṁ prabhuḥ 11. 27. 21) and after performing the funeral rites for him with the wives of Karṇa, came out of the river Gaṅgā (sa tābhiḥ saha dharmātmā pretakṛtyam anantaram kṛtvōttatāra gaṅgāyāḥ) 11. 27. 24; (vi) When the Pāṇḍavas, who had given water offerings, were still on the Bhāgīrathī, Dvaipāyana, Narada and others and their pupils and hundreds of thousands of other Brāhmaṇas gathered there to console Yudhiṣṭhira 12. 1. 1-2, 4-5, 8; (8) Cremation of Pāṇḍu and Mādrī: The cremation was performed on an auspicious and even spot in the forest on the river Gaṅgā (ramaṇīye vanoddeśe gaṅgātīre same śubhe); the bier (śibikā) in which their dead bodies were brought from Hāstinapura were placed on this spot 1. 118. 16-17; (9) Certain other epic events in which the Gaṅgā is referred to: (i) At Pramāṇakoṭi, Duryodhana tied up Bhīma, while he was asleep, and threw him in the waters of the Gaṅgā 1. 55. 10; 3. 13. 74; (ii) Droṇa with his pupils once went to the Gaṅgā for bathing when a crocodile caught him by his ankle (jaṅghānte) 1. 123. 69; (iii) When Drupada was brought captive by his pupils to Droṇa, the latter told Drupada that in future he (Drupada) would rule over the Pañcāla country which lay to the south of the Bhāgīrathī while he (Droṇa) himself would rule over the part of the country which lay to its north; Drupada then established himself in the capital city of Kampilya in the countryside of Mākandī on the river Gaṅgā ruling the southern Pāñcālas as far as the river Carmaṇvatī 1. 128. 12, 15; 1. 154. 24; (iv) Drupada while reaming along the bank of the Gāṅgā, came across a settlement of the Brāhmaṇas (brāhmaṇāvasatha) 1. 155. 5; (v) The Aṅgāraparṇa episode: The Pāṇḍavas on their way to the Pañcālas reached the Somaśravāyaṇa tīrtha on the river Gaṅgā; Aṅgāraparṇa, king of the Gandharvas, had already arrived there to sport with his wives in the waters of the river Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī; he was angered when he heard the voice of the Pāṇḍavas approaching the river; he told the Pāṇḍavas to leave the place as the forest along the rivers Gaṅgā and Vākā belonged to him; Arjuna questioned the sole right of the Gandharva over the river either at night, or by day, or in twilight (nadyām asyām …kasya kḷptaḥ parigrahaḥ 1. 158. 15); it was therefore not proper for the Gandharva to withhold the river from others since that was against the age old custom (katham icchasi tāṁ roddhuṁ naiṣa dharmaḥ sanātanaḥ 1. 158. 20); why should the Pāṇḍavas be restrained from touching the waters of the Bhāgīrathī 1. 158. 2, 4, 5, 11, 13, 15, 20, 21; defeat of Aṅgāraparṇa in this episode alluded to in 1. 2. 86; later the Gandharva and the Pāṇḍavas took leave of each other on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī 1. 174. 5; (vi) Arjuna, during the period of his exile, entered the river Gaṅgā for bathing; as he wanted to come out of the water he was dragged by Ulūpī in the water of that river 1. 206. 11-13; (vii) Arjuna, during his exile, while going to the east, crossed many rivers one of them being the Gaṅgā 1. 207. 5-6; (viii) Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma and Arjuna crossed the rivers Mālā, Carmaṇvatī and Gaṅgā on their way to the Magadha 2. 18. 21; (ix) On account of the cries of thousands of animals that were burnt at the Khāṇḍava forest the fish in the waters (?) of the Gaṅgā were terrified 1. 219. 28 (tena śabdena vitresur gaṅgodadhicarā jhaṣāḥ; Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 228. 32: gaṅgododhicarā iti atidūrasthopalakṣaṇam); (x) The Pāṇḍavas spent their first night of forest life under a banyan tree called Pramāṇa on the river Jāhnavī; they bathed in it and had only the water of the Jāhnavī to drink for the night 3. 1. 39-40; from the bank of the river Jāhnavī they started towards the Kurukṣetra 3. 6. 1; (xi) On the mountain Himavant Arjuna took bath in the Gaṅgā before ascending Indra's chariot to go to the Indraloka 3. 43. 20; (xii) Bhīṣma once lived as a muni on the bank of the river Bhāgīrathī practising the vow taken by his father (pitryaṁ vratam); there he heard from Pulastya the fruit obtained by visiting the tīrthas 3. 80. 11-12; there, on the bank of the Gaṅgā, he also heard the narrative of Vipula from Mārkaṇḍeya 13. 43. 17; (xiii) When the Pāṇḍavas were near the Gandhamādana mountain (3. 155. 34) Yudhiṣṭhira showed to Bhīma the river Mahāgaṅgā 3. 155. 69, 85; (xiv) The basket (mañjūṣā) containing the newly born Karṇa went down from the river Aśvanadī to the Gaṅgā (via the Carmaṇvatī and the Yamunā) and then to the city of Campā 3. 292. 25-26; when the Sūta Adhiratha went with his wife to the Jāhnavī, she saw there by chance the floating basket brought to the bank by the waves of the Jāhnavī 3. 293. 1, 3; (xv) The army of the Kauravas, collected for the war, spread along the bank of the Gaṅgā 5. 19. 30; (xvi) Kuntī, who wished to approach Karṇa to tell him the truth about his birth, went to the Bhāgīrathī to meet him; there on the bank of the Gaṅgā she heard the sound of the prayers recited by Karṇa 5. 142. 26-27; (xvii) Arjuna wishing to propitiate Śiva to seek his help in fulfilling the vow to kill Jayadratha saw the Gaṅgā on his way 7. 57. 24; (xviii) Bhīma, in search of Aśvatthāman, reached the bank of the Bhāgīrathī where he saw Vyāsa and the other sages seated on the bank (udakānte) 10. 13. 12-13; (xix) After the great war, Kṛpa, Aśvatthāman and Kṛtavarman, after their meeting with Dhṛtarāṣṭra, rode fast on horse-back towards the Gaṅgā 11. 10. 19; (xx) Bhīṣma, having narrated to Yudhiṣṭhira the Itihāsa connected with the praise of the Gaṅgā (itihāsaṁ…gaṅgāyāḥ stavasaṁyutam), advised him to approach the Gaṅgā with great devotion in order to obtain the highest perfection (siddhim uttamām); he and his brothers were delighted to hear this Itihāsa of the Gaṅgā from Bhīṣma 13. 27. 103-104; (xxi) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra decided to retire to the forest he, along with Gāndhārī, Kuntī, Vidura and Saṁjaya, went in a day a long distance from Hastinapura and camped on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī; next morning they started from there towards the north 15. 24. 16, 23; after going some distance they again camped on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī; in the evening he and Gāndhārī went to the Gaṅgā and performed the prescribed purificatory rites (cakāra vidhivac chaucam); Vidura and other men performed individually all the neccessary rites (cakruḥ sarvāḥ kriyās tatra puruṣā vidurādayaḥ) after bathing in the various tīrthas (tīrtheṣv āplutya); when the purificatory rites were over Kuntī led Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī to the bank of the Gaṅgā; there the priests of the king laid a Vedī (kṛto vedīparistaraḥ) on which Dhṛtarāṣṭra gave offerings in the fire; from the bank of the Bhāgīrathī they all proceeded to the Kurukṣetra 15. 25. 1, 4-8; (10) Meeting with the dead: Vyāsa asked Dhṛtarāṣṭra and all those staying with him to go to the bank of the Bhāgīrathī to meet all those who fell in the war; accordingly all of them went to the Gaṅgā and resided there 15. 39. 18-22; then in the evening Vyāsa bathed in the Bhāgīrathī and invoked all those who fought on the side of the Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas; at his call, all the kings, Bhīṣma, Droṇa, and the rest, together with their armies, rose in thousands from the water (of the Bhāgīrathī) 15. 40. 4, 7, 13; after some time, at the instance of Vyāsa, they again disappeared plunging into the river Tripathagā (Gaṅgā) and repaired to their respective places; then Vyāsa, standing in the water (of the Tripathagā), told the Kaurava women that those who wished to obtain the worlds of their respective deceased husbands should quickly enter the water of the Jāhnavī; the women, fully believing the words of Vyāsa, took permission of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and entered the water of the Jāhnavī; freed of their bodies they were united with their husbands and acquired the worlds of their husbands 15. 41. 13, 17-21; (11) End of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī and Kuntī: When Nārada arrived at Hāstinapura to meet Yudhiṣṭhira he paid a visit to the Gaṅgā on his way; people residing near the Gaṅgā had told Yudhiṣṭhira that Dhṛtarāṣṭra was engaged in severe austerities; Yudhiṣṭhira therefore asked Nārada if he had met Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the rest during his visit to the Gaṅgā and how they fared; Nārada told him that after their last meeting with Dhṛtarāṣṭra the latter had repaired to the Gaṅgādvāra; once, after his bath in the Gaṅgā, when Dhṛtarāṣṭra had started for his hermitage, wind arose, fire engulfed the forest, and burnt it (gaṅgāyām āpluto dhīmān āśṛamābhimukho 'bhavat 15. 45. 18); Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī and Kuntī were burnt in the fire; only Saṁjaya escaped from the forest fire and was seen, surrounded by ascetics, by Nārada on the bank of the Gaṅgā 15. 45. 5-6, 10, 29-32; Nārada further informed Yudhiṣṭhira that Dhṛtarāṣṭra was burnt on the bank of the Jāhnavī not by the ordinary fire but by the sacred fire which Dhṛtarāṣṭra himself and his priests had left after performing the rites (i. e. the forest fire was caused by the sacred fire left by Dhṛtarāṣṭra) (nāsau vṛthāgninā dagdho yathā tatra śrutaṁ mayā); this was reported to Nārada by the sages whom he met on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī 15. 47. 1-6; when asked by Nārada to give the water offerings to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī and Kuntī (kartum arhasi kaunteya teṣāṁ tvam udakakriyām), Yudhiṣṭhira went to the Gaṅgā with his brothers and wife; there, going into the water, they all offered water (dadus toyam) and stayed outside the city to undergo purification (śaucaṁ nivartayantaḥ) 15. 47. 9-13; (12) Ulūpī entered the Gaṅgā when, at the end, the Pāṇḍavas and Draupadī started for the forest 17. 1. 25; 

  F.   Past and mythological events in which the river Gaṅgā figures: (1) Past events: (i) Bhagīratha brought her down from the heaven: The sage Kapila had told Aṁśumant, the grandson of Sagara, that his grandson will bring down the Tripathagā from the heaven by propitiating Maheśvara for the purification of the burnt sons of Sagara 3. 107. 27; however, the descent of the Gaṅgā from the heaven was first attempted by Dilīpa, father of Bhagīratha, without success 3. 106. 38; Bhagīratha, desirous of seeking the favour of the Gaṅgā, went to the Himavant to practise austerities 3. 107. 4; after one thousand years the Gaṅgā appeared before Bhagīratha in a bodily form 3. 107. 14; when requsted by Bhagīratha to wash the bones (śarīrāṇi) of the sons of Sagara so that they might go to heaven, she agreed, but first asked Bhagīratha to propitiate Śiva by tapas so that he might agree to hold her on his head; no one else could check her speed when she descended from heaven; Bhagīratha succeeded in securing a boon from Śaṅkara to hold the Gaṅgā 3. 107. 18-25; Śiva assured Bhagīratha to hold the Devanadī (Gaṅgā) when she came down from heaven; Śiva then went to the Himavant and asked Bhagīratha to request the daughter of the king of the mountains (Gaṅgā not directly named) to come down from the heaven; when Bhagīratha thought of the Gaṅgā (gaṅgāṁ samanucintayat 3. 108. 5), the river descended from heaven on Śiva's forehead; the river became triple while flowing thence to the ocean (sā babhūva visarpantī tridhā rājan samudragā 3. 108. 10); the river asked Bhagīratha to show her the way; Bhagīratha led her to the place where lay the bones (śarīṛāṇi) of the sons of Sagara; after holding the Gaṅgā on his head Hara went to the Kailāsa; Bhagīratha having reached the ocean with the Gaṅgā filled it with the water of the river; Bhagīratha made Gaṅgā his daughter (duhitṛtve ca nṛpatir gaṅgāṁ samanukalpayat); he offered water of the Gaṅgā to the manes 3. 108. 17; 12. 29. 62; Lomaśa thus told Yudhiṣṭhira how the Gaṅgā came to be Tripathagā (flowing in three regions-heaven, mid-region, and the earth) and how she was made to descend also to fill the ocean with water (pūraṇārthaṁ samudrasya pṛthivīm avatāritā) 3. 108. 2-18; the incident of the descent of the Gaṅgā on the head of Śiva also alluded to in 5. 109. 6; 6. 7. 28; 13. 27. 71, 87, 89, 95; 13. 106. 26; 13. 134. 17; (ii) Other events related to Bhagīratha and the Gaṅgā: (a) Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī formerly sat on the lap of Bhagīratha while he was seated on the slope (near the river), hence she came to be known as Urvaśī (upahvare nivasato yasyāṅke niṣasāda ha/gaṅgā bhāgīṛathī tasmād urvaśī hy abhavat purā 12. 29. 61 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 29. 68: urvaśī ūrau vāso yasyāḥ sā iti yogāt/ūrvasīty apekṣite hrasvatvaṁ varṇaviparyaś ca pṛṣodarāditvāt jñeyaḥ); (b) From the lake Bindusaras Bhagīratha watched Bhāgīrathī Gaṅgā and lived there for many years 2. 3. 9; 6. 7. 41; (c) Bhagīratha gave on the Gaṅgā a myriad of hundreds of cows (gavāṁ śatānām ayutam) 13. 106. 37; he gave gifts (of cows ?) which would cover the entire current of the Gaṅgā (srotaś ca yāvad gaṅgāyāś channam āsīj jagatpate/ dakṣiṇābhiḥ pravṛttābhiḥ) 13. 106. 24; (iii) Jahnu and the Gaṅgā: The Gaṅgā became the daughter of Jahnu (duhitṛtvam anuprāptā gaṅgā yasya (i. e. jahnoḥ)) 13. 4. 3; Jahnu waited on her (jahnur jāhnavisevitā) 13. 151. 44; (iv) King Yayāti, desirous of arranging a Svayaṁvara for his daughter Mādhavī, went to a hermitage situated on the confluence of the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā; his sons Pūru and Yadu put their sister on a chariot and rushed to the same hermitage 5. 118. 1-2; the entire region between the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā in the middle of the earth was given by Yayāti to his son Pūru as his kingdom (gaṅgāyamunayor madhye kṛtsno 'yaṁ viṣiyas tava/ madhye pṛthivyās tvaṁ rājā) 1. 82. 5; (v) A battle was fought between Haryaśva and the Haihayas, the kinsmen of Vītahavya, in the region lying between the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā; in this battle Haryaśva was killed 13. 31. 11; Divodāsa, son of Sudeva, established Vārāṇasī on the north bank of the Gaṅgā and to the south of Gomatī (to avoid the attack by the Haihayas) 13. 31. 18, 16; when, later, Pratardana, the son of Divodāsa, wanted to attack the Vaitahavyas (= Haihayas) he crossed the river Gaṅgā 13. 31. 35; (vi) On the river Gaṅgā, near Kanyakubja, king Gādhi married his daughter Satyavatī to Ṛcīka Bhārgava 3. 115. 17; (vii) The sage Cyavana Bhārgava once took the vow of staying in water for twelve years (udavāsakṛtārambho babhūva sumahāvrataḥ…varṣāṇi dvādaśa munir jalavāse dhṛtavrataḥ) 13. 50. 3-4; he became stiff like a post (sthāṇubhūtaḥ) and after worshipping the deities entered the waters of the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā; he withstood with his head the terrific current of the two rivers; the two rivers, and those which followed them, made a pradakṣiṇā of the sage and did not cause harm to him; the sage slept in the waters like a log of wood and then stood erect (antar jale sa suṣvāpa kāṣṭhabhūto mahāmuniḥ/ tataś cordhvasthito dhīmān abhavad bharatarṣabha) 13. 50. 6-9; (viii) Sage Cyavana took his residence for some time on the bank of the river Gaṅgā to observe a vrata 13. 53. 55; (ix) At a place not far from Kanyakubja on the bank of the Gaṅgā is the Aśvatīrtha where from the waters of the Gaṅgā arose a thousand horses having one black ear; Ṛcīka, the son of Cyavana, got them by the favour of Varuṇa 13. 4. 16-17; (x) A certain Brāhmaṇa once lived in the city Mahāpadma on the southern bank of the Gaṅgā 12. 341. 1; (xi) When Śuka was born on the mountain Meru (merupṛṣṭhe), Gaṅgā in her original form (svarūpiṇī) arrived there to bathe him 12. 311. 12; (xii) Once, Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin, the young son of Sṛñjaya, accompanied by his nurse, ran while playing on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī; he was then attacked by Indra's vajra in the form of a tiger 12. 31. 31; (xiii) Gautama and his brothers put their eldest brother Dīrghatamas in a wooden box and put it on the Gaṅgā; king Bali, who had gone to bathe in the river Gaṅgā (not named), saw the box brought to him by the current of the water 1. 98. 18, 21; (xiv) When the Kṣatriyas were destroyed by Rāma Jāmadagnya, Aṅga, the son of Diviratha, was protected by Gautama on the bank of the Gaṅgā 12. 49. 72; (xv) Bharata, the son of Duḥṣanta, offered on different rivers a thousand horse-sacrifices of which he bound fourteen horses on the river Gaṅgā (yo baddhvā…aśvān devebhyo… gaṅgām anu caturdaśa//aśvamedhasahasreṇa…iṣṭavān sa mahātejā dauḥṣantir bharataḥ purā//) 12. 29. 41-42; (xvi) Bharadvāja, when he went to the Gaṅgā for bath, saw there the Apsaras Ghṛtācī who had also come there to bathe 1. 154. 2; (xvii) Vasiṣṭha turned the Gaṅgā, proceeding towards the Kailāsa, to the Mānasa lake; when that lake got mixed with the river, the Gaṅgā became the Sarayū 13. 140. 23-24; (xviii) Rājadharman, the son of Kaśyapa and Dākṣāyaṇī, offered to Gautama, his guest, large fishes (mahāmīnāḥ) obtained from the regions through which the river Gaṅgā flew 12. 164. 4; (xix) A certain Brāhmaṇa, Kauśika by name, told the truth to the robbers about the whereabouts of the people who were afraid of them; by this act he incurred sin on the river Gaṅgā 12. 110. 8 (reference to 8. 49. 41-46 where in st. 32 Gaṅgā is not named); (xx) The following persons attained perfection (siddhi) on the Gaṅgā: (1) Śilavṛtti, when instructed by Siddha on the virtues of the Tripathā, worshipped the Gaṅgā according to the rites and attained perfection which was very difficult to attain; Siddha himself, after instructing Śilarati, entered the sky 13. 27. 101-102; (2) Sage Sanatkumāra attained great perfection on the Gaṅgā 3. 135. 6; (xxi) Indra, in the form of a very weak Brāhmaṇa, appeared before Yavakrī and started doing an impossible deed viz. constructing a dam in the Bhāgīrathī by filling the Gaṅgā with sand; he poured constantly handfuls of sand in the Bhāgīrathī; when asked by Yavakrī smilingly why he was busy with this fruitless effort Indra told him that he wanted to construct a dam in the Gaṅgā so that the river can be crossed easily 3. 135. 30-36; (2) Mythological: (i) Gaṅgā once went to pay a visit to Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) in his assembly; there her garment was displaced by the wind; King Mahābhiṣa, who happened to be there, constantly looked at her in that condition; he was therefore cursed to be born again as a human being; Gaṅgā returned from the assembly continuing to think about Mahābhīṣa; she saw the Vasus, dejected, going along the way; she asked them the cause of their dejection; the Vasus told her that they were cursed by Vasiṣṭha to be born as humans; they requested Gaṅgā to assume a human form so that she could give birth to them as humans; Gaṅgā agreed and asked them whom would they like to be their father; they chose Śaṁtanu, the son of Pratīpa; Gaṅgā also had thought of the same person, hence she would do what was dear to the king and to the Vasus; Vasus requested Gaṅgā to throw them into water no sooner they were born; Gaṅgā agreed to even that request, but asked them to spare one of them so that Śaṁtanu's union with her would not be totally fruitless; Vasus consented to do that, each one of them contributing one-eighth share for Gaṅgā's son; and they also told her that the son of the Gaṅgā would beget no son; having come to this agreement with the Gaṅgā the Vasus, delighted, went their way 1. 91. 4-22; (ii) The lustre (tejaḥ 13. 84. 11) of Rudra fell in Agni; Agni was to beget through that lustre a son on the Gaṅgā for killing the enemy of the gods; Agni went to the Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī and became mixed with her; as a result, Gaṅgā became pregnant; Gaṅgā could not bear the embryo, was mentally distressed, and was in great agony; when Agni laid the lustrous embryo in the Gaṅgā, an Asura (not named) roared fiercely; terrified, the Gaṅgā was unable to bear the embryo; Jāhnavī, with her body covered with lustre and trembling, told Agni that she could not contain his lustre within her; she was very much uneasy and was agitated; she would like to cast away the embryo, as she could hold it no longer, and not because of her sweet will; she was no longer her usual self; Agni, however, asked her to contain the embryo within her: as she was capable of bearing and containing the whole earth there was nothing which Gaṅgā could not achieve except (perhaps) containing the seed of Agni; in spite of the entreaties of Vahni and the other gods the Gaṅgā cast off the embryo on mount Meru; Gaṅgā was capable of holding an embryo, but she could not do it on this occasion as she was overcome by the lustre of Rudra; when she cast it off, she appeared before Agni who asked her if the delivery was happy (kaccid garbhaḥ sukhodayaḥ); he asked her to describe to him the colour, the form and the lustre of the child; having described to Agni the form of his son the goddess (devī) Gaṅgā disappeared 13. 84. 8, 12, 52-72; 9. 43 8-9 (where the embryo is said to have been cast off on the mountain Himavant; when the embryo was cast off that part of the mountain became of gold 9. 43. 14); the son Kumāra was first Gāṅgeya (son of Gaṅgā), then became Kārttikeya (the son of the Kṛttikās); the Gaṅgā, the best among the rivers, waited on him 9. 43. 20; when the child approached Śiva, Pārvatī, Gaṅgā and Pāvaka (Agni) each one of them wondered whom he would show his honour by going to him or her first (kiṁ nu pūrvam ayaṁ bālo gauravād abhyupaiṣyati/api mām iti sarveṣām teṣām āsīd manogatam) 9. 43. 34-35; knowing their mind the child assumed four forms (tato 'bhavac caturmūrtiḥ), of which the form Naigameṣa went to the Gaṅgā 9. 43. 37, 39; then all the four, Rudra, Devī, Pāvaka and the Gaṅgā, bowed down to Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) and requested him to grant Kumāra the overlordship of all beings i. e. of the kings of all the classes of gods (ādhipatyam; senāpatyam dadau tasmai sarvabhūteṣu bhārata/sarvadevanikāyānāṁ ye rājānaḥ pariśrutāḥ/tān sarvān vyādideśāsmai sarvabhūtapitāmahaḥ) 9. 43. 42, 44, 48, 49; when the gods gave different gifts to Kumāra, Gaṅgā gave him a divine water vessel which was the source of the nectar (kamaṇḍaluṁ divyam amṛtodbhavam uttamam) 9. 45. 45; people call Kumāra differently the son of Pitamaha, or of Maheśvara, or of Umā, or of the Kṛttikās, or of the Gaṅgā 9. 45. 86; the incident is also alluded to in 3. 207. 4; 13. 27. 87 (iyaṁ gāṅgā …guhasya rukmasya ca garbhayoṣā; Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 26. 88: garbhayoṣā garbhadhāriṇī strī); (iii) Once when the gods performed a satra in the Naiṁiṣa forest (3. 189. 1), they saw a (golden) lotus coming floating on the river Bhāgīrathī; to find out its source, Indra went to the place of the origin of the Gaṅgā (yatra gaṅgā satataṁ saṁprasūtā); he saw there a woman weeping while standing in the water of the river; the tear which fell in the water became a golden lotus 1. 189. 10-11; (iv) When, in former times, Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) once performed a sacrifice on the Mahendra mountain, Bhāgīrathī was present in the sadas (yatra bhāgīrathī puṇyā sadasyāsīt) 3. 85. 17; (v) When the fish, reared by Manu, outgrew the size of the large vāpī, it requested Manu to take it to the Gaṅgā, the chief wife of the ocean (samudramahīṣīm…gaṅgām); as requested, Manu took the fish to the Gaṅgā and put it in its water; when the fish further so grew in size that it could not move in the Gaṅgā (gaṅgāyāṁ hi na śaknomi bṛhatvāc deṣṭituṁ prabho), it requested Manu to take it to the ocean; accordingly Manu pulled it out of the Gaṅgā and took it to the ocean 3. 185. 18-19, 21-22; (vi) Nārada, once early in the morning, descended into the water of the Gaṅgā arising at the Dhruvadvāra to take bath (pispṛkṣuḥ); Indra also happened to go there; both of them bathed in its water (āplutya) and, with controlled mind, performed japa; then they sat down on the bank, covered with thin golden sand, to tell each other stories told by gods and sages narrating holy deeds (puṇyakarmabhir ākhyātā devarṣikathitāḥ kathāḥ) 12. 221. 6-9; (vii) The two rivers, the Gaṅgā and the Sarasvatī, became the eyebrows of Nārāyaṇa when he assumed a different form by his mighty device (aiśvareṇa prayogeṇa dvitīyāṁ tanum āśrītaḥ) to get back the Vedas stolen by the two Dānavas Madhu and Kaiṭabha 12. 335. 43, 46; (viii) Mṛtyu, conceived as a woman (12. 249. 15-18), avoiding to kill men, went to the river Gaṅgā on the mountain Meru and stood there motionless like a piece of wood 12. 250. 22; (ix) Mārkaṇḍeya saw the Gaṅgā, among other rivers, in the belly of the Bāla (3. 186. 83, i. e. Nārāyaṇa 3. 187. 3) 3. 186. 93; (x) When Śiva asked Umā to instruct him in the duties of women (strīdharma 13. 134. 10), she first wanted to consult the rivers, the Gaṅgā and others, who were expert in that subject (strīdharmakuśalāḥ); when Umā approached the rivers they appointed the Gaṅgā to address Umā on their behalf; the river told Umā that they felt blessed since Umā held them in high esteem, but it was indeed Umā who was the right person to instruct them in the strīdharma; when the goddess (Umā) was thus honoured by the Gaṅgā she discoursed on the strīdharmas to them 13. 134. 17-30; (xi) Once, when the ocean asked the rivers why they carried away large trees but not the small and weak cane growing on their banks, the Gaṅgā told him the reason convincingly giving the grounds 12. 114. 3-7; (xii) Rāma crossed (the Gaṅgā) at Śṛṅgaverapura 3. 83. 4; (xiii) Once, while Śiva was seated on the peak of the mountain Meru and was being attended upon by gods and others, the Gaṅgā in bodily form (rūpiṇī) waited on him 12. 274. 16. 

  G.   Similes: The Gaṅgā, in various aspects, figures as an upamāna: (1) To compare an army with: (i) The army of Duryodhana, returning to the Hāstinapura, with its white parasols, banners, and the very white chowries was an image of the current of the Gaṅgā (gaṅgaughapratimā camūḥ) 3. 240. 42; (ii) The army of Duryodhana, eleven akṣauhiṇīs strong, looked like the Gaṅgā while at some distance from the Yamunā (gaṅgeva yamunāntare) 6. 18. 18; (iii) The army of the Pāṇḍavas proceeding to the battle-field looked full and irresitible like the Gaṅgā (gaṅgeva pūrṇā durdharṣā) 5. 149. 49; (iv) The army, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, with its formidable archers looked full, tranquil and flowing like the Gaṅgā (bhīmadhanvāyanī senā… gaṅgeva pūrṇā stimitā syandamānā vyadṛśyata) 5. 197. 10 (Nī. on Bom.

Ed. 5. 139. 11: uṣṇage uṣṇātigame varṣākale) 5. 137. 11; (vii) Bhīma would enter the army of the Kauravas as does the current of the Gaṅgā the trees growing on its banks 5. 50. 35; (viii) The Trigartas (five brothers), in the war, would agitate the army of the Pāṇḍavas as the crocodlies agitate water of the Gaṅgā 5. 163. 10; (ix) The army of the Kauravas, attacked by Arjuna, was split into two (some going to Droṇa, some to Duryodhana) as does the Gaṅgā on meeting a mountain 7. 29. 29; (x) The army of the Kauravas, at the sight of Ghaṭotkaca, was struck with fear and was agitated, as are the surging waves of the Gaṅgā, whose eddies are agitated by wind 7. 131. 31; (xi) The Pāñcālas attacked the army of Duryodhana on all sides as the swans, returning from the Mānasa lake, rush towards the Gaṅgā 8. 43. 64; (xii) The army of the Pāṇḍavas was agitated by the Madra warriors as is the Gaṅgā by the hostile wind (purovātena gaṅgeva) 9. 17. 10; (xiii) When the Kaurava heroes (Droṇa and others), who were ready (for attack) at a distance of twenty steps attacked Abhimanyu, they appeared, for a while, like an eddy of the Gaṅgā and the ocean (where the former meets the latter) (te viṁśatipade yattāḥ saṁprahāraṁ pracakrire/āsīd gāṅga ivāvarto muhūrtam udadher iva) 7. 35. 13 (Nī., however, on Bom.

  B.   Residence: Lived in Bhogavatī Purī in the southern direction; he, with Vāsuki, protected it 5. 107. 19; 5. 101. 9; he had his abode (niveśana) also in the Khāṇḍava forest where Asura Maya happened to stay at the time of the great fire 1. 215. 7; 1. 219. 35; Uttaṅka, in his praise of the nāgas, referred to Takṣaka as living in Khāṇḍava near Kurukṣetra, along the river Ikṣumatī 1. 3. 142-146. 

  C.   Status: Second only to Vāsuki according to an enumeration based on eminence (yathāśreṣṭhān) 5. 101. 8; called the king of the serpents nāgarāja 1. 3. 119, 120, 166; sarparāja 1. 218. 4; chief of serpents nāgendra 1. 38. 34; 1. 39. 3; pannagendra 1. 38. 33, 35 etc.; best among serpents pannagottama 1. 37. 13, 19, etc.; bhujagottama 1. 48. 15, 18; pannagaśreṣṭha 1. 38. 32, 36; 1. 40. 3; uragasattama 1. 39. 16; however Uttaṅka called Takṣaka pannagādhama 1. 3. 188. 

  D.   Description: He was of blazing lustre (tigmatejas), his poison acted like fire and burnt the being he bit (āśīviṣa) 1. 37. 13; lotus-coloured (padmavarcas) 1. 40. 3; he was called by Uttaṅka and Janamejaya ‘evil-minded’ (durātman 1. 46. 36, 40; duṣṭāntarātman 1. 3. 185, 187), and by Janamejaya ‘sinful’ (pāpa) 1. 46. 37. 

  E.   Khāṇḍava incident: Since Takṣaka lived in the Khāṇḍava forest, whenever god Fire tried to burn it, Indra, being Takṣaka's friend, he immediately extinguished the fire 1. 215. 7; when the forest was finally on fire, Takṣaka was not in Khāṇḍava but was safe at Kurukṣetra 1. 218. 4; Indra was informed of this by an invisible voice 1. 219. 12-13. 

  F.   Takṣaka and the kuṇḍalas: Uttaṅka informed by Pauṣyaś wife (kṣatriyā) while handing over her earrings to him that Takṣaka coveted them; Uttaṅka assured her that Takṣaka would not be able to attack him 1. 3. 119-120; Takṣaka assumed the form of a nacked mendicant (nagna śramaṇa) and followed Uttaṅka on way; he took the kuṇḍalas, placed by Uttaṅka on the ground, and ran away; when caught by Uttaṅka, Takṣaka assumed his original form and suddenly entered a big hole; on reaching nāgaloka he entered his residence (svabhavana); Uttaṅka went behind him 1. 3. 136-138; when the nāgaloka was filled with smoke issuing from the anus of a horse (really god Agni) the confused Takṣaka, frightened by the heat of fire, returned the kuṇḍalas to Uttaṅka 1. 3. 158-159; when asked by the teacher the cause for delay in getting the kuṇḍalas, Uttaṅka told him the hindrance caused by Takṣaka 1. 3. 165-166; angered by this incident Uttaṅka started for Hāstinapura to take revenge on Takṣaka 1. 3. 177. 

  G.   Death of Parikṣit: Due to the curse pronounced by Śṛṅgin king Parikṣit was destined to die within a week due to the burning lustre of the eminent serpent Takṣaka 1. 37. 13-14, 19; 1. 46. 8-10; Śṛṅgin's father informed Parikṣit about his impending death at the hands of Takṣaka 1. 38. 19; 1. 46. 12-13; Kāśyapa, an eminent sage (munipuṁgava 1. 38. 35), who knew the cure for serpent bites started for Hāstinapura to save Parikṣit from Takṣaka and acquire wealth 1. 38. 31-33; Takṣaka, in disguise of an aged Brāhmaṇa, met Kāśyapa on way and asked him the reason for his hurrying on the way; Kāśyapa told Takṣaka that he wanted to cure Parikṣit when he would be burnt by the fire of Taṣaka's lustre (tejasā 'dya pradhakṣyati); then Takṣaka revealed his identity and told Kāśyapa that he would not be able to save Parikṣit from Takṣaka's bite; Kāśyapa retorted that he was confident about the strength of his science (vidyābala) 1. 38. 34-39; 1. 46. 15-17; Takṣaka challenged Kāśyapa to bring back to life a nyagrodha bitten and burnt by him; this was done by Kāśyapa by his vidyābala 1. 39. 1-10; astonished, Takṣaka promised to give Kāśyapa all the wealth he desired from Parikṣit, and even more, and begged him to return; he also told Kaśyapa that the curse of the sage was bound to come true, and if Kāśyapa was not able to save Parikṣit he would lose his reputation; having received from Takṣaka the wealth he wanted Kāśyapa turned back 1. 39. 11-19; 1. 46. 18-21; Takṣaka then started for Hāstinapura; on way he learnt about the arrangements made to save Parikṣit with the help of mantras and medicines which worked as cures for poison (mantrāgadair viṣaharaiḥ 1. 39. 21); Takṣaka planned to deceive Parikṣit with some trick (māyāyoga) and sent to the king serpents in the disguise of hermits with fruits, leaves, and water; when the seventh day since the curse was uttered was about to end Parikṣit felt himself secure; he found a small worm in the fruit held by him and said (in joke): “may this small worm turn into Takṣaka and bite me” (kṛmiko māṁ daśatv ayam takṣako nāma bhūtvā vai 1. 39. 31) and put it on his neck; immediately Takṣaka coiled around the king with his body (bhoga) 1. 39. 22-33; the ministers of the king cried and fled; they saw a wonderful (adbhuta) serpent rising up in the sky 1. 40. 1-3; the whole house was on fire due to the heat of the serpent's poison; Parikṣit died due to the fire (tejas) of Takṣaka's poison 1. 40. 4-5; (chadmenopetya takṣakaḥ…dagdhavān viṣavahninā 1. 46. 22-23). 

  H.   Snakesacrifice: Uttaṅka, embittered by Takṣaka due to the obstacle put by him in Uttaṅka's way, reported to Janamejaya how Takṣaka was responsible for his father's death, and instigated him to burn Takṣaka in the fire of a sarpasatra 1. 3. 177-190; when Janamejaya enquired with his ministers they told him how his father was killed by Takṣaka (1. 45. 19-28; 1. 46. 1-25); Janamejaya again asked them how they could know the conversation between the Pannagendra (i. e. Takṣaka) and Kāśyapa when, apparently, it took place in a secluded place in the forest; if satisfied with their explanation he would think of the means to kill the serpents (vidhāsyāmi pannagāntakarīṁ matim) 1. 46. 26-27; the ministers reported that a man happened to mount the tree before it was burnt by Takṣaka; this man had heard the dialogue between Takṣaka and Kāśyapa; the man too was burnt with the tree; when brought back to life along with the tree the man returned to the town and reported the incident to others 1. 46. 28-31; Janamejaya, satisfied with this account, decided to avenge the death of his father by killing serpents for it was the evil-minded Takṣaka who had offered wealth to Kāśyapa and persuaded him not to go to Hāstinapura 1. 46. 35-41; Janamejaya wished to know from his house-priest if there was any rite by which he could get Takṣaka and his relatives in the kindled fire; just as Takṣaka had burnt Parikṣit by the fire of his poison (viṣāgni), so too Janamejaya wished to burn the serpent; priests informed Janamejaya about a rite known as sarpasatra, not performed by any one before; thereupon Janamejaya considered Takṣaka as good as burnt in the sacrificial fire 1. 47. 3-8; Takṣaka having come to know of the sarpasatra went to Indra and sought his shelter; Indra had already propitiated Pitāmaha on Takṣaka's behalf and therefore assured Takṣaka that there was no danger to his life from the fire of sarpasatra; Takṣaka then lived happily in Indra's dwelling 1. 48. 14-18; in the meantime when the snake sacrifice was in progress Āstīka appeared at the place of sacrifice where serpents were falling in the fire in large numbers; he praised king Janamejaya; pleased, Janamejaya desired to offer a boon to Āstīka and asked permission of the officiating priests; they gave the permission since Takṣaka was to arrive soon; but the hotṛ priest told Janamejaya that Takṣaka was not showing; Janamejaya asked the priests to spare no pains and get Takṣaka quickly; the priests told the king that as the Śāstras informed them and as the Fire narrated to them Takṣaka, out of fear, had taken shelter with Indra 1. 51. 1-5 (yathā śāstrāṇi naḥ prāhur yathā śaṁsati pāvakaḥ/indrasya bhavane rājaṁs takṣako bhayapīḍitaḥ); the king's bard Lohitākṣa, who knew what had transpired (paurāṇiko veditavān purastāt 1. 51. 6), confirmed what the priests had told the king; he said that Indra had asked Takṣaka to stay with him and feel free from any danger from fire; Janamejaya urged his hotṛ priest to proceed and the priest with his mantras called Indra himself; Indra appeared on the scene with the serpent tucked to his uttarīya; Janamejaya asked the priests to make Takṣaka fall in the fire with Indra if he sought shelter in Indra's residence; priests told Janamejaya, as they heard a thunderous roar, that Takṣaka was coming under the king's control, they were sure that the serpent was dropped down by Indra and was falling from his lap, the serpent's body was loosened by the mantras (mantravisrastakāyaḥ 1. 51. 13) and he had lost consciousness; they permitted Janamejaya to grant a boon to Āstīka since the rite was progressing according to the prescription and as Takṣaka was about to fall into the fire; Āstīka chose the boon: “let this sacrificial session come to an end, and let no more serpents fall (into the fire)” (satraṁ te viramatv etan na pateyur ihoragāḥ 1. 51. 17); in vain did Janamejaya try to persuade Āstīka to choose another boon; Janamejaya agreed to stop the session and granted freedom from risk to serpents 1. 51. 6-23; 1. 53. 8; Āstīka admitted that Takṣaka was somehow saved because Janamejaya followed the path of truth (and kept his word) (kathaṁcit takṣako muktaḥ satyatvāt tava pārthiva) 15. 43. 14; Sūta called it a great miracle of Āstīka that when Takṣaka slipped from Indra's hand, he remained in the sky and did not drop down in the fire; on Śaunaka's query whether Takṣaka's not falling down from the mid-region was due to the fact that the (suitable) mantras did not reveal themselves to the priests (mantragrāmo manīṣiṇām na pratyabhāt 1. 53. 4), Sūta replied that that happened because Āstīka thrice said to the serpent ‘stay’ (tiṣṭha) 1. 53. 1-6, and Takṣaka stayed.  I. Upamāna:  Bhīṣma with his sharp weapons compared with the big serpent Takṣaka having excess of poison (viṣolbaṇa) 6. 103. 15; a bow picked up by Aśvatthāman had the lustre of the body of Takṣaka 8. 57. 60.

  C.   Bhīṣma's falling down in the Dakṣiṇāyana and his death in the Uttarāyaṇa: When Bhīṣma fell down on the battlefield he heard a heavenly voice in the midregion resounding all around saying “how should the high-souled Gāṅgeya (Bhīṣma) die when it was Dakṣiṇāyana ?” (kathaṁ mahātmā gāṅgeyaḥ…/kālaṁ kartā naravyāghraḥ saṁprāpte dakṣiṇāyane) 6. 114. 88; the great sages who, in the form of the swans, were sent by Gaṅgā observed that the sun was in the south when Bhīṣma fell from the chariot (dakṣiṇena ca bhāskaram 6. 114. 93); they said to each other: (it seems) Bhīṣma, though high-souled, shall die when it was Dakṣiṇāyaṇa (itaretaram āmantrya prāhus tatra manīṣiṇaḥ/bhīṣma eva mahātmā san saṁsthātā dakṣiṇāyane//) 6. 114. 94 (Nī. on Bom.

  D.   Death in the Dakṣiṇāyana: If a Yogī dies during the six months of the Dakṣiṇāyana he, after reaching the moon's relam of light, returns to this world (ṣaṇmāsā dakṣiṇāyanam/tatra cāndramasaṁ jyotir yogī prāpya nivartate//) 6. 30. 25; Nārada, while consoling Sṛñjaya lamenting over the death of his son, told him that Ambarīṣa, son of Nābhāga, and hundreds of other kings who performed the Aśvamedha, went towards the Dakṣiṇāyana (i. e. died during the Dakṣiṇāyana) (sarve 'śvamedhair ījānās te 'bhyayur dakṣiṇāyanam) 12. 29. 96; (Nī., however, who reads anvayuḥ, on Bom. Ed. 12. 29. 103: sarve rājānaḥ…dakṣiṇāyanam anu paścāt ayur gatāḥ/uttarāyaṇamārgeṇa hiraṇyagarbhalokaṁ prāptāḥ ity arthaḥ); but men who perform bad deeds and who die in the Dakṣiṇāyana wait upon Dharmarāja (Yama) in his sabhā (narā duṣkṛtakarmāṇo dakṣiṇāyanamṛtyavaḥ/…upāsate dharmarājam) 2. 8. 28-29.

  B.   Use by Śiva: (1) Śiva killed with it all Daityas in the battle 7. 57. 16; (all the enemies of gods) 7. 57. 65; (2) Śiva charged his arrow with the Pāśupata missile and shot it to burn the tripuras of the three sons of Tāraka Asura 8. 24. 115, 120; (8. 24. 4, 10-12); 13. 14. 128. 

  C.   Śiva gave it to (1) Arjuna: Two accounts: (i) Arjuna desired to have Śiva's Pāśupata missile so that he could burn the Dānavas, the Rākṣasas, the Bhūtas, the Piśācas, the Gandharvas and the mythical serpents (pannagas) in battle; he could then be a match for Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, and Karṇa 3. 41. 7, 9, 11; Arjuna called it Brahmaśiras which was terrific and of fierce power (yat tad brahmaśiro nāma raudraṁ bhīmaparākramam) 3. 41. 8; Śiva ready to give Pāśupata, his dear weapon (dayitam astram), to Arjuna as he was capable of possessing (dhāraṇa), releasing (mokṣa), and withdrawing (saṁhāra) it 3. 41. 13; to receive it, Arjuna purified himself and remained fully attentive (śucir bhūtvā samāhitaḥ); he folded his hands and said to Śiva ‘recite (the mantra)’ (adhīṣva); Śiva then taught it to Arjuna together with its secrets and mode of withdrawal (sarahasyanivartanam) 3. 41. 17-18; the missile, like the God of Death in bodily form, then waited on Arjuna; at that time the earth trembled and there was a loud sound of conches, drums and bheris by thousands; the gods and demons saw the missile in bodily form standing near Arjuna 3. 41. 17-22; 1. 1. 109; 3. 163. 48, 51; 6. 116. 38; 8. 57. 44; (ii) During the night, after Arjuna took the vow to kill Jayadratha the next day before sunset, Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to acquire the knowledge of the great Pāśupata missile from Śiva in order to be able to accomplish his vow; Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to mentally approach god Śiva; Arjuna touched water (saṁspṛśyāmbhaḥ), sat down on the ground, and mentally went to Bhava (Śiva) 7. 57. 17-19; Arjuna praised Śiva and made him favourable to give the missile 7. 57. 59; Śiva told Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa that nearby there was a lake of nectar where he had left his divine bow and arrow; he asked them to get his bow and arrow 7. 57. 6465; when they brought the bow and arrow, a Brahmacārin came from the side of Śiva; he held the bow and, putting the arrow on it, drew it according the prescriptions (vyakarṣac cāpi vidhivat saśaraṁ dhanur uttamam 7. 57. 75); having seen how the Brahmacārin held the bow in his grip, how he drew the string, and the posture adopted by him (tasya maurvīṁ ca muṣṭiṁ ca sthānaṁ cālakṣya pāṇḍavaḥ 7. 57. 76), and having heard the mantra recited by Śiva, Arjuna understood the way how to employ Pāśupata; the arrow was shot by the Brahmacārin in the lake and the bow was again placed in it; Arjuna then remembered the boon Śiva granted to him during his stay in the forest (āraṇyaka) and his meeting Śiva, and wished that he might now receive the boon; knowing Ariuna's mind, Śiva gave him the boon, the Pāśupata missile, and wished him success in accomplishing his vow; Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna bowed down to Śiva and, when permitted to leave, delighted they returned to their camp, 7. 57. 73-81; (Śiva gave missile to Arjuna 7. 173. 100); (2) Besides Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa knew the use of Pāśupata 7. 57. 79; 8. 57. 44; Bhīṣma is not so sure about Kṛṣṇa's knowledge of the Pāśupata 6. 116. 39. 

  D.   Effects: The missile, when released, produced thousands of tridents (śūlas), fierce maces (gadāś cograpradarśanāḥ), and charmed arrows having the form of serpents (śarāś cāśīviṣākārāḥ saṁbhavanty anumantritāḥ) 3. 41. 10. 

  E.   Restrictions on its use: Arjuna was specifically told by Śiva that the missile was never to be used against men (na prayojyaṁ bhaved etan mānuṣeṣu kathaṁcana); Arjuna was to use the missile only if he was under severe pressure (pīḍyamānena balavat), or if he wished to ward off the missiles used by his opponents (astrāṇāṁ pratighāte ca sarvathaiva prayojayeḥ) 3. 163. 49-50; 3. 41. 15; if used against ordinary persons it would burn the entire world 3. 41. 15. 

  F.   Use in the epic war: (1) Arjuna in his message to the Kauravas, sent through Saṁjaya, threatened that he would use the Pāśupata missile against them in the war 5. 47. 100; Kṛṣṇa told Karṇa that in the ‘sacrifice to be performed with the weapons’ (śastrayajña 5. 139. 29), the mantras recited by Arjuna while releasing the Pāśupata and other missiles would serve as the mantras used while performing a sacrifice 5. 139. 31; (2) Droṇa used Pāśupata against Arjuna and it was repelled (jaghāna) by Arjuna presumably by using the same missile 7. 163. 28; (3) Karṇa used it against Yudhiṣṭhira and hence Kṛṣṇa apprehended Yudhiṣṭhira's death in the war 8. 43. 21, 18. 

  G.   Status: The Pāśupata missile surpassed all other missiles like Brāhma, Nārāyaṇa, Aindra, Āgneya, and Vāruṇa; it could destroy all weapons (sarvaśastravighātana) 13. 14. 127; even gods like Indra, Yama, Kubera, Varuṇa, and Vāyu did not know it 3. 41. 14; there was none who could not be killed by it; besides its use on an arrow, it could be released even by mind, eye, and speech (manasā cakṣuṣā vācā dhanuṣā ca nipātyate) 3. 41. 16.

  B.   Origin: Śiva wanted to tame sage Uśanas, a Bhārgavarelative (bhārgavadāyādo muniḥ 12. 278. 7) because Uśanas had taken away the riches of Kubera; so Śiva, with śūla in hand, went to Uśanas; Uśanas using his Yogic powers appeared on the tip of the śūla; Śiva then bent the śūla to get Uśanas into his hand; the śūla, bent by the hand (pāṇi), was called by Śiva ‘pināka’ (ānatenātha śūlena pāṇināmitatejasā/pinākam iti covāca śūlam ugrāyudhaḥ prabhuḥ 12. 278. 18-19; Nīla. uses this description to suggest a fanciful etymology of pināka: śūlam eva pinākapadena uvāca/yataḥ pāṇinā anāmayat ataḥ pinākam/tena ādyapadasyādyantavarṇābhyāṁ dvitīyasya madhyamābhyāṁ kapratyayayuktābhyāṁ pinākapadam niṣpannam iti yogapradarśanaṁ kṛtam Bom.

*1st word in left half of page p42  (+offset) in original book.Pūrvā Bhādrapadā  : f.; also called  Pūrvā Proṣṭhapadā  (du., pl.);  Pūrva Proṣṭhapada  m. (sg.) (6. 3. 14): Name of a double nakṣatra distinguished as Pūrvā and Uttarā. 

  A.   Religious rites: (1) dāna: Nārada told Devakī (13. 63. 2-4) that by offering the rājamāṣas (kind of beans) as a gift under the Pūrvabhādrapadā conjunction one enjoys all kinds of food and becomes happy in next life (pūrvabhādrapadāyoge rājamāṣān pradāya tu/sarvabhakṣaphalopetaḥ sa vai pretya sukhī bhavet//) 13. 63. 31; (2) śrāddha: Yama told Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that by offering a kāmya śrāddha under Pūrvaproṣṭhapadā one obtained many goats and sheep (pūrvaproṣṭhapadāḥ kurvan bahu vinded ajāvikam) 13. 89. 13; but in general one is not supposed to offer any rites to gods and manes under the two Proṣṭhapadā nakṣatras (daivaṁ pitryam athāpi ca/… na proṣṭhapadayoḥ kāryam) 13. 107. 119. 

  B.   Bad effect: Śukra, when in conjunction with the two Proṣṭhapadās has always wealth, so also the Lord of riches (i. e. Kubera); Śukra (when in conjunction with the two nakṣatras) takes away from men whatever wealth they had earned as desired (nityaṁ proṣṭhapadābhyāṁ ca śukre dhanapatau tathā/manuṣyebhyaḥ samādatte śukraś cittārjitaṁ dhanam//) 5. 112. 3 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 5. 114. 3: proṣṭhapadābhyām iti tṛtīyā…saptamyarthe tena tasmin nakṣatradvaye śukre śukravāsare tadyoge sati śukro 'gniḥ dhanapatau kuberasya vṛddhyarthaṁ manuṣyebhyaḥ saṁpradānebhyaḥ dhanaṁ datte dadāti/ śukraś cittārjitam ity anena vahniretastvaṁ tasya pradarśyate/dhanārthī uktanakṣatravārayoge vahniṁ prārthayet/tac ca dhanaṁ yāgādidvārā vā bhūmau nikhanena vā sarvaṁ kuberaṁ praty eva gacchatīti bhāvaḥ). 

  C.   Bad omen: Among the bad omens pointed out by Vyāsa to Dhṛtarāṣṭra one referred to Śukra's having ascended the Pūrva Proṣṭhapada constellation and then having gone over to the Uttara Proṣṭhapada, was still looking at it (i. e. looking at the Pūrva Proṣṭhapada) 6. 3. 14 (for the citation and Nī.'s commentary on it see above  Uttarā Bhādrapadā  p. 232. 2).

 previous_page p940       next_page p942Prasvāpa  : nt.: Name of a missile which sent the adversary to sleep.

  It was fashioned by Viśvakarman (viśvakṛtam) and it belonged properly to Prajāpati (prājāpatyam) 5. 184. 12; described as ‘dear’ (sudayita, dayita) 5. 184. 11; 5. 184. 15; 5. 185. 23; it was known to Bhīṣma in his former life (pūrvasmin dehadhāraṇe); in his long-drawn fight with Rāma Jāmadagnya, when Bhīṣma was dejected, the eight Vipras (Vasus) reminded him of this missile in a dream and told him that it would flash upon him again (idam astram sudayitam pratyabhijñāsyate bhavān); the missile was not known to Rāma Jāmadagnya, and to no one else on the earth; the Vipras advised Bhīṣma to employ it forcefully (bhṛśaṁ saṁyojayasva 5. 184. 13) against Rāma Jāmadagnya; as a result Rāma would not die but just go to sleep; in its use against his teacher Rāma, Bhīṣma would incur no sin; Bhīṣma will have thus defeated Rāma with Prasvāpāstra (to be awakened by him later by using Saṁbodhanāstra); since Rāma could not be killed in battle, he was to be defeated by using Prasvāpāstra; the Vipras told Bhīṣma that a hero sent to sleep in battle and the one killed were considered by them equal (prasuptaṁ vā mṛtaṁ vāpi tulyaṁ manyāmahe vayam 5. 184. 16) 5. 184. 9-17; the next day when Bhīṣma thought of the missile for employing it, it flashed in his mind (cintitaṁ ca tad astraṁ me manasi pratyabhāt tadā) 5. 185. 22-23; the gods, appearing in the heaven, however, forbad Bhīṣma from using Prasvāpa against Rāma; as Bhīṣma put the arrow on his bow, Nārada drew Bhīṣma's attention to what the gods asked him and he told Bhīṣma not to insult Rāma who was his teacher; the eight Vipras also asked Bhīṣma to do what Nārada told him, since therein lay the welfare of the worlds (etad dhi paramaṁ śreyo lokānām); hence Bhīṣma withdrew the missile; when Rāma saw Bhīṣma withdrawing the missile he accepted defeat at the hands of Bhīṣma (dṛṣṭvā tad astraṁ vinivartitaṁ vai/jito 'smi Bhīṣmeṇa sumandabuddhir ity eva vākyaṁ sahasā vyamuñcat) 5. 186. 1-8.

*1st word in left half of page p397  (+offset) in original book.Brahmaśiras^1  : nt.: Name of a missile (once called brahmāstra 10. 15. 21). 

  A.   History: Supposed to have arisen from Brahman's lustre (brahmatejobhava 10. 15. 7); Droṇa, after practising severe austerities, received the missile Brahmaśiras from Agastya 10. 12. 14; later it was taught by Droṇa to Arjuna when he was satisfied (pritimān, prīyamāṇaḥ) with him (Arjuna) 1. 123. 72; 10. 12. 5 and, not with great delight (nātihṛṣṭamanāḥ), to Aśvatthāman whom he had apparently first refused to teach 10. 12. 6. 

  B.   Description: powerful missile (paramāstra) 1. 123. 78; 10. 15. 3, 6; famous as ‘uncomparable’ in the worlds (asāmānyam idaṁ tāta lokeṣv astraṁ nigadyate) 1. 123. 76; divine (divya) 10. 15. 16; outstanding (viśiṣṭa) 1. 123. 74; highly irresistible (atidurdhara) 1. 123. 74; fiery (mahārciṣmat) 10. 14. 7; difficult to obtain (duravāpa) 10. 15. 9; worshipped by gods and Gandharvas (devagandharvapūjita) 10. 12. 14; capable of burning the whole earth (dahed yad pṛthivīm api) 10. 12. 4. 

  C.   Restrictions on its use: (1) while giving the astra to Arjuna, Droṇa told him not to use it against men, but to use it only if he was attacked in a battle by a superhuman enemy (amānuṣaḥ śatruḥ); if released against an enemy of lesser mettle (alpatejas), the missile would burn the world 1. 123. 75, 77; (2) while teaching it to Aśvatthāman, who was known to be rash by nature, Droṇa warned him not to use it even under dire circumstances in battle, especially not against men (paramāpadgatenāpi na sma tāta tvayā raṇe/idam astraṁ prayoktavyaṁ mānuṣeṣu viśeṣataḥ) 10. 12. 7-8. 

  D.   Taught by Droṇa only to Arjuna and Aśvatthāman: (1) It was given to Arjuna since Droṇa considered him to be distinguished among his pupils (viśiṣṭaṁ sarvaśiṣyebhyaḥ) 1. 123. 72; 10. 15. 21; when taught to Arjuna, he would be an unrivalled archer (bhavitā tvatsamo nānyaḥ pumāĩ loke dhanurdharaḥ) 1. 123. 78; Droṇa taught to Arjuna, both its use and withdrawal (saprayoganivartanam) 1. 123. 74; its withdrawal very difficult; once released, no one except Arjuna, not even Indra, was capable of withdrawing it 10. 15. 5, 6; it could not be withdrawn by one who had not observed celibacy; if a non-qualified person tried to withdraw it, it would cut his head and destroy his belongings 10. 15. 7-8; Arjuna could withdraw it as he was truthful, brave, had practised celibacy, and was obedient to his teacher 10. 15. 10, 20, 24; although fully qualified to withdraw it, Arjuna never used it in the epic war nor outside it, even under stress (brahmacārī vratī cāpi duravāpam avāpya tat/paramavyasanārto 'pi nārjuno 'straṁ vyamuñcata) 10. 15. 9, (brahmāstram apy avāpyaitad…kṣatradharmān mahābāhur nākampata dhanaṁjayaḥ) 10. 15. 21; (2) Envious of Arjuna, Aśvatthāman asked his father to teach him Brahmaśiras; Droṇa gave it to him but not with a pleased mind (nātihṛṣṭamanā iva) 10. 12. 6; (since Aśvatthāman could not make use of it) he wanted to exchange it with Kṛṣṇa for his (Sudarśana) Cakra so that Aśvatthāman could be invincible 10. 12. 15, 36; Kṛṣṇa offered to give any one of his weapons to Aśvatthāman without receiving from him in return his Brahmaśiras 10. 12. 18-19; Aśvatthāman chose the Cakra but failed even so much as to move it from its place 10. 12. 20-23. 

  E.   Use: As Aśvatthāman was cruel and rash, there was every danger of his using Brahmaśiras against Bhīma, who was chasing him 10. 12. 40; when Aśvatthāman actually used it on an iṣīkā, Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to release his Brahmaśiras to counter it; Arjuna got down from the chariot with bow and arrow in hand, wished ‘well’ (svasti 10. 14. 5; 1. 1. 155) first to Aśvatthāman, then to himself and to his brothers (the Pāṇḍavas); then bowing down to deities and teachers, he released Brahmaśiras, wishing welfare, and saying ‘may the missile pacify (Aśvatthāman's) missile’ (utsasarja śivaṁ dhyāyann astram astreṇa śāmyatām) 10. 14. 4-6; 10. 15. 2, 20; 1. 1. 155; at that time fire broke out like the fire at the end of the aeon; the fire of Arjuna's missile matched the fire of Aśvatthāman's missile; as a result terror struck the creatures, skies were filled with great sound and were engulfed in fire, earth, with its mountains and trees, shook; the two missiles produced heat with their lustre 10. 14. 7-11; just then Nārada and Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana, desiring welfare for all the people, appeared and stood between the two missiles; they pointed out that Brahmaśiras was never used by any one before against men 10. 14. 16; in response to their appeal, Arjuna immediately withdrew his Brahmaśiras; but Aśvatthāman could not 10. 15. 1-15; moreover, if Brahmaśiras was pacified by the other powerful missile (paramāstra) there would be no rain in the land for twelve years 10. 15. 23; Aśvatthāman then directed his missile towards the foetus of the Pāṇḍavas 10. 15. 31, 32; 10. 16. 9. [See  Iṣīkā, Brahmaśiras^2, Brahmāstra ]

 previous_page p119       next_page p121Brahmaśiras^2  : nt.: Name of the missile of Śiva (Rudra) (identified with the fierce (ghora), divine (divya) Pāśupatāstra 3. 41. 7). 

  A.   Origin: It arose from amṛta 3. 89. 11; Rudra acquired it with austerities 3. 89. 10.

  C.   Given to Arjuna: Arjuna requested Śiva to give his Brahmaśiras (Pāśupata); armed with it, Arjuna wanted to burn in battle the Dānavas, the Rākṣasas, the Bhūtas, the Piśācas, the Gandharvas, and the Pannagas; using it Arjuna wanted to fight with Bhīṣma, Droṇa. Kṛpa, and Karṇa 3. 41. 8-11; Arjuna received it from Rudra together with the mantras to be recited at the time of its employment, the mode of withdrawing it, and the benediction meant for expiation (if wrongly used) samantraṁ sasaṁhāraṁ saprāyaścittamaṅgalam 3. 89. 11 (however, Nī. prāyaścittam astrāgninā niraparādhānāṁ dāhe yo doṣas tasya śodhanam/maṅgalaṁ dagdhānām evārāmādīnāṁ punarvikasanam/ on Bom.

  D.   Effect: When employed, thousands of śūlas, gadās, and serpent-like ‘charmed’ arrows came out of it (śarāś cāśīviṣākārāḥ saṁbhavanty anumantritāḥ) 3. 41. 10. [See  Pāśupata, Brahmaśiras^1 ]

  C.   Organisation: A kulapati presided over it and decided whether a newcomer was to be permitted in the āśrama 13. 10. 12-15 (see the next section). 

  D.   Past events: A certain Śūdra once arrived at Brahmāśrama and was honoured by the ascetics; he desired to practise dharma (icchāmi dharmaṁ cartum) 13. 10. 13, and hence requested the head of the āśrama (kulapati) to teach him and initiate him into the ascetic practices (tan māṁ tvaṁ bhagavan vaktuṁ pravrājayitum arhasi) 13. 10. 13 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 10. 14: pravrājayitum vidhivat svocitaṁ karma tyājayitum); the head of the āśrama told him that it was not possible for him to be an ascetic (pravrājaka) and live in the āśrama (na śakyam iha śūdreṇa liṅgam āśritya vartitum) 13. 10. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 10. 16: liṅgaṁ saṁnyāsacihnam); so the Śūdra went some distance from the āśramapada and constructed a cottage for himself; he put up an altar, levelled the ground, and raised abodes for gods (gatvāśramapadād dūram uṭajaṁ kṛtavāṁs tu saḥ/tatra vediṁ ca bhūmiṁ ca devatāyatanāni ca/niveśya/) 13. 10. 17 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 13. 10. 20: vedīṁ pūjārthaṁ, bhūmiṁ śayanādyartham); a certain ascetic (muni, ṛṣi, tāpasa) who acted as a priest for the rites of manes (pitṛkārya) of this Śūdra became in his next bitrh the Purohita of the king (viz. the Śūdra who was born as a king); when the Purohita was told by the king about his past life he went to the same Brahmāśrama to practise austerities; he obtained great perfection (siddhiṁ parāṁ prāptaḥ) and was respected by the residents of the āśrama 13. 10. 10-59.

  A.   Relationship with god Brahman: Destined by god Brahman for repulsing all other missiles (sarvāstrapratighātāya vihitaṁ padmayoninā) 7. 172. 32; when withdrawn by Kṛṣṇa from the stillborn Parikṣit, the flaming missile returned to Pitāmaha (Brahman) 14. 69. 1, 3. 

  B.   Gods and heroes who knew its use: (1) Among the gods, Indra knew it 5. 47. 100; (2) Among men: (i) Droṇa: He received it from Rāma Jāmadagnya; when Droṇa received it, he became distinguished among men 1. 154. 13; Droṇa not equalled by any one in the use of Brahmāstra; Drupada attributed his defeat at the hands of Droṇa to Droṇa's knowledge of Brahmāstra 1. 155. 22; Droṇa unequalled in battle by any one because of his knowledge of Brahmāstra (and other missiles) (…brahmāstrādīni yāny api/tāni sarvāṇi tiṣṭhanti bhavaty eva viśeṣataḥ) 7. 160. 5; known for his knowledge of Brahmāstra, Droṇa knew its use and remedy (saprayogacikitsitam) 3. 38. 5; 4. 46. 7, 9; 7. 166. 2; (ii) Arjuna: He was taught (niṣṭhita) Brāhma astra by his teacher (Droṇa) 1. 181. 20; 6. 116. 38; in its use, he never violated the rules of the Kṣatriyas (kṣatradharmān mahābāhur nākampata dhanaṁjayaḥ) 10. 15. 21; Arjuna was asked by Indra to learn the Paitāmaha astra (identical, or different from Brahmāstra ?) 3. 164. 29; (iii-v) Bhīṣma, Kṛpa, and Aśvatthāman: According to Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma, Kṛpa and Aśvatthāman knew its use and remedy (saprayogacikitsitam) 3. 38. 5; 4. 46. 7 (Kṛpa and Aśvatthāman); 4. 46. 9 (Aśvatthāmān); (vi) Karṇa: Karṇa requested Droṇa to teach him Brahmāstra together with its secret and withdrawal, but Droṇa refused to oblige 12. 2. 10, 13; Karṇa, who coveted the Astra (12. 3. 27, 30), then learnt it in its entirety (kṛtsnam) from Rāma Jāmadagnya 12. 3. 2; 8. 5. 67; but since Karṇa had told a lie to obtain its knowledge (12. 3. 30), Rāma cursed him saying that the missile would flash to him on all occasions except when he met his equal and the time of his death had arrived (te…brahmāstraṁ pratibhāsyati/anyatra vadhakātāt te sadṛśena sameyuṣaḥ) 12. 3. 30-31; 5. 61. 2; returning, Karṇa reported to Duryodhana that he had acquired the missiles (from Rāma) (kṛtāstro 'smi) 12. 3. 33; since Karṇa had pacified Rāma, knowledge of Brahmāstra remained with him; hence Karṇa assured Duryodhana that he was quite capable of bearing the burden of the war (tatas tad astraṁ mama sāvaśeṣaṁ tasmāt samartho 'smi mamaiṣa bhāraḥ) 5. 61. 2-4; according to Yudhiṣṭhira, Karṇa knew the use and remedy of Brahmāstra 3. 38. 5; Karṇa boasted to Śalya that he knew the Brāhma astras (pl. astrāṇi…brāhmāṇī) 8. 29. 26; (vii) Kṛṣṇa: According to Bhīṣma, perhaps Kṛṣṇa knew Brāhma and many other heavenly weapons (kṛṣṇo vā devakīputraḥ) 6. 116. 39; (viii) Vibhīṣaṇa: He prayed Brahman that the Brahmāstra might flash to him although it was not duly taught to him (aśikṣitaṁ ca bhagavan brahmāstraṁ pratibhātu me) 3. 259. 30; [For its use also by Yudhiṣṭhira, Kuvalāśva, Bṛhatkṣatra, Pradyumna, Rāma (Dāśarathi), and Lakṣmaṇa see below section 

  F.  ]. 

  C.   Description: heavenly (divya) 3. 271. 16; 7. 101. 12; 7. 160. 5; 7. 165. 22, 105; 8. 29. 27; 9. 61. 13, (19); great missile (mahāstra) 3. 163. 33; 7. 165. 23; 8. 65. 23; (param astram) 8. 66. 52; (paramāstra) 5. 185. 15; best (uttama) 5. 185. 16; unrivalled (apratima) 8. 29. 27; dreadful (ghora) 3. 274. 27, (māhāghora) 8. 5. 67; fierce (ugra) 8. 65. 23; unbearable (asahya) 8. 65. 24; of unmatched strength (apratimaujas) 3. 274. 27; invincible even in thought (manasā tad dhy ajayyam) 8. 29. 27; highly respected (paramasaṁmata) 1. 154. 13; to be employed mentally (manasā saṁvidheyam) 8. 65. 24; cannot be withstood even by Indra 9. 61. 27. 

  D.   Teaching of the astra: The use of the missile was to be taught in full (kṛtsnam), i. e. together with the mode of its withdrawal; this is how Rāma Jāmadagnya taught it to Karṇa after performing due rites (tasmai sa vidhivat kṛtsnam brahmāstraṁ sanivartanam/provāca) 12. 3. 2; Droṇa learnt from Rāma Jāmadagnya both--the mode of its employment (prayoga) and withdrawal (saṁhāra) 1. 154. 11; when Karṇa expressed his desire to learn it from Droṇa he wanted to know it with its secrets and the mode of its withdrawal (sarahasyanivartanam) 12. 2. 10; Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, Karṇa and Aśvatthāman reputed for their knowledge of the employment of the astra and its remedy (i. e. withdrawal) (saprayogacikitsitam) 3. 38. 5; it could be taught only to a Brāhmaṇa who had duly observed the prescribed vow (yathāvat caritavrataḥ), or a Kṣatriya who had practised austerities (tapasvī), but to none else 12. 2. 13; hence Karṇa told a lie to Rāma Jāmadagnya about his lineage while declaring that he was a Bhārgava Brāhmaṇa 12. 2. 15; 12. 3. 26-30. 

  E.   Use and withdrawal: At the time of its employment, mantras related to Brahmāstra were recited on an arrow to use it as a charged missile (bāṇavaryaṁ…brahmāstreṇābhimantritam) 3. 274. 24-25; (brahmāstraparimantritaiḥ sāyakaiḥ) 3. 167. 17; (saṁmantrya) 8. 66. 52; these mantras used to charge the arrow with the Brāhma (and the other astras) were supposed to serve as the ritual mantras for the ‘sacrifice to be performed with weapons’ (śastrayajña, i. e. in the war) 5. 139. 31; it was necessary to support the bow and the arrow with great might (balenātha sa saṁstabhya brahmāstraṁ samudairayat) 8. 66. 48; at the time of withdrawing the Brahmāstra (Iṣīkā) employed by Aśvatthāman, Kṛṣṇa touched water (upaspṛśya) 14. 68. 16, 14. 69. 1, and also made a satyakriyā 14. 68. 19-23. 

  F.   Uses: (1) In the epic war: (i) by Droṇa--(a) against Arjuna in order to cut down the bhalla arrows 7. 67. 9 (samudīraya-); 7. 163. 43 (prāduṣkṛ-); 9. 61. 27; (b) against Yudhiṣṭhira to burn his śakti to ashes 7. 81. 32-33 (prāduṣkṛ-); 7. 132. 33 (udīraya-); (c) against Bṛhatkṣatra of the Kekayas 7. 101. 12 (prāduṣkṛ-); (d) against the Pāñcālas, killing twenty thousand chariot-fighters, besides many elephants and horses 7. 164. 79-83 (prāduṣkṛ-); in addition, Droṇa killed ten ayutas of the Pāñcāla soldiers with Brāhma astra as if to destroy all the Kṣatriyas (kṣatriyāṇām abhāvāya brāhmam ātmānam āsthitaḥ) 7. 165. 14-15; (e) against the armies of the Pāṇḍavas, the Kekayas, the Matsyas, specially of the Pāñcālas killing by hundreds and thousands; Droṇa also burnt one thousand chariot-fighters and two thousand elephant-riders 7. 165. 100-102; (f) against Dhṛṣṭadyumna while dashing the horses of his chariot against those of Dhṛṣṭadyumna (brāhmam astram udīrayan) 7. 164. 129; (udīrayetāṁ brāhmāṇi divyāny astrāṇy anekaśaḥ) 7. 165. 22; (brāhmam astraṁ vikurvāṇaḥ) 7. 165. 100; (divyam astraṁ vikurvāṇaḥ) 7. 165. 105; (ii) by Arjuna: (a) He assured Kṛṣṇa that by employing his Brāhma astra he would repulse all the missiles used against him by the protectors of Jayadratha 7. 53. 44; (b) Arjuna cut down with the rain of arrows released by the use of the Brahmāstra the shower of arrows released against him by Droṇa by using the same missile 7. 67. 12; 7. 163. 46; (c) Arjuna released (udīraya-) his Brāhma astra to nullify the effect of the Āgneya astra (7. 172. 14) of Aśvatthāman 7. 172. 14; (d) against Karṇa: Arjuna thought of using it for the welfare of the people (śivāya lokasya) and the death of Karṇa (vadhāya sauteḥ); to do this he sought the permission of Kṛṣṇa, the gods, Brahman, Śiva, and of all the knowers of brahman (brahmavid) 8. 65. 23-24; Arjuna advised to use Brahmāstra by Kṛṣṇa 8. 66. 52 (visṛj-, prayojaya.); he countered Karṇa's Brahmāstra by using apparently the same missile (tad astram astreṇāvārya) 8. 67. 8; (iii) by Karṇa: (a) when he was surrounded at once by many Pāṇḍava warriors 8. 33. 25 (udīraya-); (b) against Arjuna 8. 66. 48 (samudīraya-); 8. 67. 8; (9. 61. 27); (iv) by Yudhiṣṭhira: to pacify the Brahmāstra of Droṇa used against him 7. 81. 34; 7. 132. 35; (v) by Dhṛṣṭadyumna: He and Droṇa used (udīraya-) heavenly Brāhma missiles (pl.) against each other in many ways (brāhmāṇi divyāny astrāṇy anekaśaḥ) 7. 165. 22; Dhṛṣṭdyumna repelled successfully all missiles used by Droṇa 7. 165. 23; (vi) by Bṛhatkṣatra (a Kaikeya): he repulsed Droṇa's Brāhma astra by the use of the same weapon 7. 101. 13, (14); (2) Outside the epic war: (i) by Arjuna: (a) against Kirāta (Śiva); but it was destroyed by Kirāta 3. 163. 33, 35; (b) against the Nivātakavacas to blow them away by hundreds and thousands with the arrows released from the missile 3. 167. 17; (ii) by Aśvatthāman: the iṣīkā directed by Aśvatthāman towards the foetus of Uttarā (10. 15. 31, 33) identified with Brahmāstra 14. 65. 9; 14. 67. 21; 14. 68. 16; 14. 69. 1; (14. 67. 13, 16); (iii) by Rāma Jāmadagnya: he used it against Bhīṣma 5. 185. 15 (prāduṣkṛ-); (iv) by Bhīṣma: to counter with the same missile the use of the Brahmāstra by Rāma Jāmadagnya 5. 185. 16 (prayuj-); (v) by Pradyumna: against Śālva to cut off half way his Daiteyāstra (māyā) 3. 20. 17; (vi) by Kuvalāśva: against the Daitya Dhundhu who was burnt with it 3. 195. 28; (vii) by Rāma (Dāśarathi): against Rāvaṇa; Rāma, while using it, recited mantras on his arrow; with it, Rāvaṇa, together with his chariot and the charioteer, were burnt down 3. 274. 24-25, 28; (viii) by Lakṣmaṇa: against the demon Kumbhakarṇa who was burnt with it 3. 271. 16. 

  G.   Effects of Brahmāstra: When the Brahmāstra was released: (i) it produced a very large number of (flaming) arrows 3. 163. 33; 3. 167. 17; 7. 67. 9 (bhalla), 12; 7. 165. 100 (bhalla); 8. 33. 25; 8. 65. 24; 8. 66. 53; 8. 67. 8; (ii) it produced fire enough to heat the worlds and fill the directions and space with lustre (tataḥ saṁtāpito loko matprasūtena tejasā/kṣaṇena hi diśaḥ khaṁ ca sarvato 'bhividīpitam) 3. 163. 34; (jajvāla) 5. 185. 16; (vyomni pādurabhūt tejaḥ) 5. 185. 18; (dīpayāṁ cakre) 5. 186. 7; (tad astraṁ jvalitam) 14. 69. 3; or to burn the enemy with it 3. 195. 28; 3. 271. 16; 3. 274. 28; 7. 165. 102; or to burn the enemy's weapon 7. 81. 33; or to burn the enemy's chariot 9. 61. 18-19; or to burn the chariot together with horses and charioteer 3. 274. 28; (iii) it produced smoke to fill the directions 5. 185. 21; (iv) it produced darkness all over which terrified creatures 7. 132. 33-34; (v) it removed the darkness produced by the enemy's missile with the result that cold winds blew and the directions became clear 7. 172. 32; (vi) all life could be threatened by it 5. 47. 101; 5. 185. 18, 20-21; 7. 163. 45; (vii) earth, with its mountains, forests, and trees shook, winds blew in the opposite direction, and the oceans were agitated 7. 163. 44; 5. 185. 22; (viii) gods and other divine and demoniac beings were heated with its blaze 5. 185. 19; or they could not remain in the mid-region and they bewailed 5. 185. 21-22; (ix) under its influence the Rakṣases infested the residence; they disappeared when the missile was withdrawn 14. 69. 2. 

  H.   Withdrawal: Brahmāstra, when employed, either served the purpose for which it was used, or was repulsed, or pacified by the counter-use of the same missile (cf. above sections 

  F.   and 

  G.  ); it was only once destroyed by Kirāta (Śiva) 3. 163. 35; only once when the same missile was employed by the opponents they clashed inbetween without reaching the respective targets 5. 185. 17; Arjuna withdrew it (= Brahmaśiras) 10. 15. 1, 5, but it (Iṣīkā identified with Brahmāstra) could not be withdrawn by Aśvatthāman as he had not observed the brahmacārivrata 10. 15. 7-8; later Kṛṣṇa withdrew it after sipping water (and making a satyakriyā) to revive the still-born child 14. 68. 16, (19-23); 14. 69. 1; when Kṛṣṇa withdrew the Brahmāstra, brilliant light emanated from the body of Parikṣit to fill the room; the evil spirlts (rakṣāṁsi) then left the house and disappeared, and the mid-region was filled with the words ‘well-done’ (sādhu keśava sādhv iti) 14. 69. 1-2. 

  I.   Comparison: the missile compared with the raised Brahmadaṇḍa 3. 274. 27; 

  J.   Status: Inferior to Pāśupatāstra of Śiva 13. 14. 127, (124). [See  Iṣīkā, Brahmaśiras^1 ]

  A.   Importance: Aṅgiras told Gautama that on the Māghī (māghyām) three crores and ten thousand tīrthas visit Prayāga 13. 26. 35. 

  B.   Auspicious: (1) for Vedic rites: Yudhiṣṭhira asked his brothers to make preparations for the Aśvamedha since the roaming horse had returned and the day was the full moon of the month of Māgha (abhito vartate hayaḥ/māghī ca paurṇamāsīyam) 14. 86. 8; (2) for non-Vedic rites: (a) The sages, Aṅgiras and others, while on a tīrthayātrā, went to the holy river Kauśikī on the Māghī (māghyām) 13. 96. 6 (for the river Kauśiki see the Editor's note on 13. 3. 10, Cr.

  A.   Description: Holy (puṇya) 13. 153. 28. 

  B.   Epic Event: Bhīṣma, lying on the bed of arrows, realized that the holy month of Māgha had arrived (māso 'yaṁ samanuprāpto māsaḥ puṇyo yudhiṣṭhira); he guessed that it must be the eighth day of the bright fortnight of that month (tribhāgaśeṣaḥ pakṣo 'yaṁ śuklo bhavitum arhati) 13. 153. 28 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 167. 28: tenādyāṣṭamīty arthaḥ). 

  C.   Religious rites: (1) Vedic: Aśvamedha: when the return of the horse, wandering on the earth, was reported to Yudhiṣṭhira, he, noticing that the day was the twelfth of the (bright) fortnight of the month of Māgha and that the constellation (viz. Puṣya) was favourable, he asked Bhīma to make preparations for the horse sacrifice (etasminn eva kāle tu dvādaśīṁ māghapākṣikīm/iṣṭam gṛhītvā nakṣatraṁ) 14. 86. 4 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 14. 85. 4: iṣṭaṁ nakṣatraṁ puṣyam); (2) Non-Vedic: (a) snāna: Aṅgiras told Gautama that if one who had controlled his mind and had strictly observed the vows bathed at Prayāga in Māgha he was purified of the sins and went to heaven 13. 26. 36; (b) dāna: One who offered sesame to Brāhmaṇas in Māgha did not go to hell 13. 65. 7; (c) upavāsa: If one, who is devoted to father (pitṛbhaktaḥ), spends the month of Māgha taking food only once a day he becomes eminent in his illustrious family and among his kinsmen (śrīmatkule jñātimadhye sa mahattvaṁ prapadyate) 13. 109. 20. 

  D.   Smile: Bhīṣma said that the arrows which pierced his vitals, as (the winter time śaiśiraḥ kālaḥ 6. 113. 7) in the month of Māgha pierced the vitals of cows, were those of Arjuna and not of Śikhaṇḍin (kṛntanti mama gātrāṇi māghamāse gavām iva/ arjunasya ime bāṇā neme bāṇāḥ śikhaṇḍinaḥ) 6. 114. 60 (see the Editor's note on the stanza, Cr.

(6) On the fourteenth day, countless Mlecchas, along with the elephants who carried them, were killed by Arjuna with the māyā of his astras (astramāyayā); vaḍas, kaṅkas and wolves were glad to drink their blood 7. 68. 37, 42, 44, 46; 7. 69. 30; (7) On the same day, Sātyaki noticed the large army of Añjanaka elephants ridden by Mlecchas 7. 87. 16-18; having secured that large army of elephants of Mlecchas, Duryodhana had felt contempt for Pāṇḍavas (etad duryodhano labdhvā samagraṁ nāgamaṇḍalam…avamanyata pāṇḍavān//) 7. 87. 37-39; Sātyaki pointed out to his charioteer the Mlecchas who, riding chariots, horses and elephants, and equipped with different weapons, desired to fight with him 7. 95. 13-14; (8) Duḥśāsana, rebuked by Droṇa, attacked Sātyaki along with a large army of Mlecchas (sainyena mahatā yukto mlecchānām anivartinām) 7. 98. 23;

it was with their support that he was going to fight with Pāṇḍavas (mlecchāś ca bahusāhaśrāḥ…madartham udyatāḥ sarve prāṇāṁs tyaktvā raṇe prabho//) 9. 2. 18, 21-22; that they were killed by thousands, was due to bad fate according to Dhṛtarāṣṭra (hatā…mlecchāś ca bahusāhasrā kim anyad bhāgadheyataḥ/) 9. 2. 36; (14) Mlecchācāryas were among those who attended the svayaṁvara of the Kaliṅga princess at Rājapura 12. 4. 8; (15) Arjuna in his wanderings with the Aśvamedha horse had to fight with Mlecchas who were formerly, in the war, offended by him (mlecchāś cānye bahuvidhā pūrvaṁ vinikṛtā raṇe) 14, 72. 24; when the horse wandered along the seacoast through Vaṅga, Puṇḍra and Kerala countries, Arjuna defeated many Mleccha armies many times (tataḥ samudratīreṇa vaṅgān puṇḍrān sakeralān//tatra tatra ca bhūrīṇī mlecchasainyāny anekaśaḥ/vijigye) 14. 83. 30; at the end of the Aśvamedha sacrifice, the sacrificial priests distributed a large quantity of gold among the Brāhmaṇas; after that, what wealth (gold) remained that was taken away over a long period by Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas, Śūdras and Mleccha tribes (anantaraṁ brāhmaṇebhyaḥ kṣatriyā jahrire vasu/ tathā viṭśūdrasaṁghāś ca tathānye mlecchajātayaḥ/kālena mahatā jahrus tat suvarṇam tatas tataḥ//) 14. 91. 25;

  A.   Birth: Son of Dākṣāyaṇī (referred to as devakanyā 12. 163. 19) and Kaśyapa 12. 164. 2. 

  B.   Residence (bhavana 12. 163. 17; nilaya 12. 163. 23; niveśana 12. 166. 10; gṛha 12. 166. 6; ālaya 12. 167. 14): Under a big nyagrodha tree, on a space covered with golden sand, in a forest near the ocean; the place was frequented by the Yakṣas and Kinnaras; the residence looked like the seat of Pitāmaha (pitāmahasadopamam) 12. 163. 6-7; 11-13. 

  C.   Description: Of pure soul (viśuddhātman 12. 166. 10), nobleminded (mahātman 12. 165. 7; 12. 167. 15), magnanimous (mahāmanas 12. 164. 6), of great understanding (mahāmati 12. 164. 10), intelligent (dhīmant 12. 165. 27), eloquent (vāgmin 12. 164. 9). 

  D.   Status: King of the cranes (bakarāj 12. 164. 9; bakarāja 12. 166. 2; 12. 167. 2, 5; bakapati 12. 165. 31; 12. 167. 1, 8; bakādhipa 12. 167. 5, 13, 14; bakendra 12. 167. 8); best among the birds or king of the birds (khagottama 12. 165. 26; khagendra 12. 166. 1); Brahmadeva when angered, however, called him ‘wicked-minded’ (duṣṭātman) and ‘worst among the cranes’ (bakādhama) 12. 167. 9. 

  E.   Visits to Brahmaloka: It was Rājadharman's practice to go to Brahmaloka during the first twilight to pay homage to god Brahmadeva 12. 166. 6; on his return journey from Brahmaloka Rājadharman used to meet his friend the Rākṣaka king Virūpākṣa every day 12. 166. 6. 

  F.   Encounter with the Brāhmaṇa Gautama: Once when Rājadharman returned from Brahmaloka in the evening he met Gautama who happened to be at his residence 12. 163. 17; Rājadharman received him as his guest with due rites and offered him a seat of śāla flowers; he also gave him big fishes from Ganges and fire (for his protection during the night); he fanned Gautama with his wings to remove his fatigue and then asked Gautama his gotra; Gautama told him only his name and that he was a Brāhmaṇa but nothing else (so 'bravīd gautamo 'smīti brāhma nānyad udāharat 12. 164. 7); Rājadharman offered his guest a bed of leaves, rich in fragrance and strewn with fragrant, heavenly flowers; when Rājadharman (Kāśyapa) asked him the reason of his arrival, Gautama told him that since he was poor he wanted to go on sea in search of wealth; Rājadharman (Kāśyapa) told Gautama that he need have no anxiety for wealth, since according to Bṛhaspati, there were four means of acquiring wealth, viz. inheritance, luck, effort, and friend (caturvidhā hy arthagatir bṛhaspatimataṁ yathā/ pāraṁparyaṁ tathā daivaṁ karma mitram iti prabho 12. 164. 12); Rājadharman, as Gautama's friend, would help him to acquire wealth; in the morning he asked Gautama to go a distance of three yojanas along a particular way where, in the city Meruvraja, lived Rājadharman's friend Virūpākṣa the chief of the Rākṣasas (rākṣasādhipati); Rājadharman was to Virūpākṣa his brother, relative and a dear friend; Rājadharman always trusted Virūpākṣa (sa (i. e. Rājadharman) hi mām āśritaḥ sadā) 12. 165. 8; hence when Gautama met Virūpākṣa he was prepared to give Gautama all that he desired 12. 163. 22-23; 12. 164. 3-16; when Gautama returned from Virūpākṣa carrying with him heavy load of gold to Rājadharman's residence under the nyagrodha tree, the latter welcomed Gautama and tried to remove his fatigue by fanning him with wings; he offered Gautama food 12. 165. 27; Gautama thought of returning home but since he had nothing to eat on way the ungrateful Gautama decided to kill Rājadharman who was a heap of flesh 12. 165. 31; Rājadharman had kept fire burning with flames for the protection of Gautama at night, and he slept by the side of Gautama fully trusting him (viśvasta); Gautama killed Rājadharman with a fire-brand; he dressed the bird by removing his wings and hair (sa taṁ vipakṣaromāṇaṁ kṛtvā 12. 166. 4) and roasted him on fire; then taking the gold and meat with him Gautama started off 12. 166. 1-4; when a couple of days passed without Rājadharman's going to meet Virūpākṣa on his way home from the Brahmaloka, Virūpākṣa was worried about Rājadharman's safety; he suspected that Gautama, devoid of virtues as he was, might have killed Rājadharman; he therefore asked his son to visit Rājadharman's residence and find out whether he was alive; Virūpākṣa's son saw near the nyagrodha tree only a skeleton of Rājadharman; he and his associates pursued Gautama, captured him, and returned to Virūpākṣa with the body of Rājadharman which was without wings, bones and feet (ºśarīraṁ ca pakṣāsthicaraṇojjhitam 12. 166. 13) 12. 166. 5-14; Virūpākṣa lamented over the loss of his friend and prepared a funeral pyre decorated with jewels, and spread over with perfumes and many pieces of cloth; after kindling the pyre of Rājadharman, Virūpākṣa performed the prescribed funeral rites; at that time divine Surabhi, daughter of Dakṣa, happened to stand above the pyre (in the sky); the foam from her mouth, mixed with milk, fell down on the burning pyre; Rājadharman came back to life and met Virūpākṣa; at that time Indra arrived on the scene and was glad that Rājadharman was alive (diṣṭyāyaṁ jīvatīty uta 12. 167. 6); Indra told them an old incident (purātanam 12. 167. 7): on a certain occasion, Rājadharman had failed to present himself in the assembly (sadas) of Brahmadeva; the enraged god cursed Rājadharman to die soon (tasmād vadhaṁ sa duṣṭātmā nacirāt samavāpsyati 12. 167. 9 [na cirāt seems to contradict purātanam]); hence Rājadharman was killed by Gautama, but was again revived by Brahman by sprinkling nectar 12. 167. 1-10; since Indra was favourably disposed to Rājadharman he was requested by Rājadharman to bring Gautama back to life; Indra revived Gautama and gave him to Rājadharman; delighted Rājadharman embraced Gautama who had with him all kinds of vessels full of gold (sabhāṇḍopaskaram 12. 167. 13); Rājadharman then took leave of Gautama and returned home 12. 167. 11-14; Rājadharman, as usual, visited the above of Brahmadeva and was received with guest worship 12. 167. 15; this narrative of Rājadharman and Gautama is called ākhyāna 12. 167. 18.

*1st word in left half of page p558  (+offset) in original book.Rudrakoṭi^1  : f.: Name of a tīrtha. 

  A.   History: Formerly a crore of devout sages sat down in order to see god (Śiva); they started for this place vying with one another to see god Śiva first; god Śiva with his divine power (yogam āsthāya) created a crore of Rudras in front of every one of them so that every one felt that he saw Rudra first (sṛṣṭā koṭis tu rudrāṇām ṛṣīṇām agrataḥ sthitā/mayā pūrvataraṁ dṛṣṭa iti te menire pṛthak) and did not entertain anger (with the thought that he was behind others in seeing Rudra) (teṣāṁ manyupraṇāśārtham ṛṣīṇām); pleased Mahādeva granted them a boon so that their religious merit would increase (adyaprabhṛti yuṣmākaṁ dharmavṛddhir bhaviṣyati) 3. 80. 124128. 

  B.   Holiness: A devout pilgrim should visit it; by bathing there, a pure person (naraḥ śuciḥ) gets the fruit of an Aśvamedha and lifts up his family (kulaṁ caiva samuddharet) 3. 80. 124, 129.

  B.   Identified with the Pāśupata (and the Brahmaśiras ?): When Arjuna prayed to Śiva to give him the divine missiles, he agreed to Arjuna's request and told him that his Raudra missile would wait on him; he then gave him his Pāśupata 3. 163. 47-48; Brahmaśiras missile, which Arjuna received from Rudra, also called Raudra (or adj. ‘fierce’ of Brahmaśiras (?)) 3. 41. 8.

  D.   Mode of use: At the time of using it (against Karṇa), Arjuna recited the mantras (anumantrya) on the arrow on which he employed it 8. 66. 58; at the time of charging his arrow with the missile (to release it against the Pauloma and the Kālakeya demons) Arjuna bowed down to Rudra (rudrāya praṇato raṇe) and wished well to the creatures (svasti bhūtebhyaḥ); he bowed down to Śarva (Rudra) again when he actually released the missile from the bow (namaskṛtvā trinetrāya śarvāyāmitatejase) 3. 170. 38, 41. 

  E.   Uses: 1. In the epic war: (i) Arjuna wanted to employ it on a heavenly arrow, resembling fire or snake's poison and which was hard like a stone, and release it against Kaṛṇa 8. 66. 58-59; there is no mention of Arjuna having released it, but it seems that he warded off Karṇa's Brahmāstra with it (not named; tad astram astreṇāvārya prajahārāsya pāṇḍavaḥ) 8. 67. 8; (ii) Aśvatthāman killed the followers of Dhṛṣṭadyumna who surrounded him after he killed Dhṛṣṭadyumna at night in the camp of the Pāṇḍavas 10. 8. 31-32; 2. Outside the epic war: (i) Arjuna used it to burn with its fire the Nivātakavaca demons 5. 136. 7; (ii) Arjuna used it to kill the Pauloma and the Kālakeya demons; Arjuna first used all his other missiles without being able to defeat the demons, but was himself oppressed by them; at that time he was afraid; he bowed to Rudra and employed the great Raudra missile on his arrow (mahāstraṁ samayojayam); he then saw a man having three heads, nine eyes, three mouths, six hands, burning, his hair bright like the sun or fire, his head covered with big snakes (tato 'paśyaṁ triśirasaṁ puruṣaṁ navalocanam/trimukhaṁ ṣaḍbhujaṁ dīptam arkajvalanamūrdhajam//lelihānair mahānāgaiḥ kṛtaśīrṣam) 3. 170. 38-39; when the missile was next actually released (muktamātre tatas tasmin) thousands of different shapes--wild animals like lions, tigers, bears, buffalos, as also snakes, cows, elephants, sṛmaras, śarabhas, bulls, boars, wild cats, śālāvṛkas, ghosts, bhuruṇḍas, vultures, eagles, crocodiles, Piśācas, Yakṣas, demons, Guhyakas, Nairṛtas, big fishes having mouths of elephants, owls, hosts of fishes and tortoises, shapes holding different weapons and swords, Yātudhānas holding gadā and mudgara, and many others--came out from the missile and filled the space; the demons were killed by many shapes having three heads, four tusks, four mouths, four hands, as also by the arrows of Arjuna which shone like the sun and the fire, which were brilliant like the Vajra and lightning, and hard like rocks; when the demons were killed by the Raudrāstra, Arjuna bowed down to Tripuraghna (Śiva) once again 3. 170. 42-51.

 previous_page p88       next_page p90Rohiṇī  : f. (sg., once pl. 12. 160. 80): Name of a constellation. 

  A.   Computation of time: Abhijit, younger sister of Rohiṇī, vying with her and desiring for a higher rank went to forest to practise austerities; Indra was then confused in calculating time (due to the loss of a nakṣatra) 3. 219. 8-9; hence Brahman ordained that time (kāla) would commence with Dhaniṣṭhā, while formerly it commenced with Rchiṇī; this made good the loss of one nakṣatra (rohiṇyādyo 'bhavat pūrvam evaṁ saṁkhyā samābhavat) 3. 219. 10 (for full citation and Nī.'s commentary see  Abhijit  and  Dhaniṣṭhā ). 

  B.   Auspicious constellation: The Pāṇḍavas left for Vāraṇāvata on the eighth day of Phalguna and under the constellation Rohiṇī (rohiṇyām) 1. 133. 30. 

  C.   Religious rites: (1) dāna: Nārada told Devakī (13. 63. 2-4) that in order to be free from debt (to the manes ?) one should, under the constellation Rohiṇī, feed the Brāhmaṇas with known kinds of meat, beans, cooked rice and clarified butter, and give them milk at the end of the meal (rohiṇyāṁ prathitair māṁsair māṣair annena sarpiṣā/payo 'nupānaṁ dātavyam ānṛṇyāya dvijātaye// 13. 63. 6 (Nī. who reads prasṛtair mārgair māṁsair explains mārgair as mṛgasaṁbandhibhiḥ); (2) śrāddha: Yama told Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that one desirous of offspring should offer a śrāddha under Rohiṇī (rohiṇyām) 13. 89. 3. 

  D.   Rohiṇī and the asi: The sword which was created by Brahman as a weapon (12. 160. 42) had the Rohiṇī stars for their gotra (rohiṇyo gotram asya (aseḥ)) 12. 160. 80. 

  E.   Omens: (1) Among the omens noticed by Vyāsa before the start of the war there was one according to which Śanaiścara was afflicting Rohiṇī (rohiṇīṁ pīḍayann eṣa sthito rājañ śanaiścaraḥ) 6. 2. 32 (also cf. the next section 

  F.   (3); also 5. 141. 7 ? see  Prājāpatya^2 ) (2) At the time of Karṇa's death, Bṛhaspati was afflicting Rohiṇī (bṛhaspatī rohiṇīṁ saṁprapīḍya) 8. 68. 49. 

  F.   Similes: (1) Yudhiṣṭhira saw Gāndhārī surrounded by her daughtersin-law as is Rohiṇī by the stars (tārābhir iva rohiṇīm) 2. 52. 27; (2) Lopāmudrā, surrounded by her hundred dāsīs and a hundred maidens, sat like Rohiṇī in the sky (rohiṇīva divi prabho) 3. 94. 24; (3) Rāvaṇa drawing near Sītā looked like the planet Śanaiścara when it approached Rohiṇī (dadṛśe rohiṇīm etya śanaiścara iva grahaḥ) 3. 265. 6; (4) Śāntā waited on Ṛśyaśṛnga like Rohiṇī on Soma (rohiṇī somam ivānukūlā) 3. 113. 22; (5) Sudeva wondered when would Damayanti be united with Nala and reach the end of her hardship as Rohiṇī on meeting the moon (rohiṇī śaśino yathā) 3. 65. 21. [See  Prājāpatya^2;  for  Rohiṇī  also see Section 1. 7]

  A.   Residence: He lived on the branches of a banyan tree in a certain forest 12. 136. 19, 22; also in a hole (svabilam) at the foot of the tree 12. 136. 190. 

  B.   Description: Had sharp front teeth and eyes resembling the cat's-eye gem; he was intelligent, eloquent (vākyasaṁpanna) and knew the import of speech vākyatattvajña) 12. 136. 65, 64, 94. 

  C.   Palita-Lomaśa Episode: A mouse, Palita, also lived in a hole at the foot of the banyan tree; Lomaśa, although normally watchful (apramatta 12. 136. 25), was once caught in a trap (unmātha 12. 136. 23) fixed by a Cāṇḍāla; when this happened Palita began to move about freely, got a piece of flesh, and started eating it on the top of the trap while smiling inwardly at the cat caught in the trap below; just then the mouse Palita saw his two other enemies, an ichneumon on the ground and an owl on the tree, wanting to get him; Palita immediately realized that the cat, his third enemy in distress, was his only means of escape; he therefore offered the cat to cut off the cords of the net if the cat in return promised not to injure him when he moved near the cat to protect himself from the ichneumon and the owl; Palita wished that Lomaśa remained alive and expected a similar response from Lomaśa (tava jīvitam icchāmi tvaṁ mamecchasi jīvitam 12. 136. 59); the cat too knew that be by himself was almost at the end of his life (tām avasthām avekṣyāntyām 12. 136. 64) and hence spoke in conciliatory terms to the mouse; Lomaśa told the mouse that he had given up his pride and that he was Palita's devotee and pupil; he was prepared to carry out Palita's order and work in his interest; he requested Palita to do what would serve the purpose of both of them; Palita then suggested the following plan to Lomaśa: the mouse was to go very close to the cat and while he was in that condition the cat was to protect the mouse from the owl and the ichneumon; when the danger to the mouse from the two had passed, the mouse was to cut the cords of the net and free the cat; Lomaśa agreed to this plan and promised not only to be welldisposed towards Palita when he drew near, but also offered later to do, with his friends and relatives, things pleasing to Palita; the mouse then moved very close to the cat and slept on his chest; having seen that the ichneumon and the owl had returned to their respective homes Palita started to cut off the cords of the net slowly; Lomaśa tried to hasten him asking him not to be ungrateful; Lomaśa wanted Palita to finish the work before the Caṇḍāla (śvapaca) returned; Palita refused to hasten until he was sure that the Caṇḍāla was close by so that Lomaśa, when freed, would not pounce on the mouse but jump on the tree from the fear of the Caṇḍāla; Lomaśa again pleaded with Palita to be more quick in his work pointing out that good men did not act the way Palita was going about his work; Palita should not remember their past enmity and delay in freeing the cat; Palita assured Lomaśa that he had cut off most of the cords and deliberately left only one which he would bite off at the proper time; when the night ended and the Caṇḍāla was seen arriving, Lomaśa was frightened and asked Palita what he intended to do; Palita cut off the last cord and the freed Lomaśa jumped up the tree as was expected by Palita, and Palita himself entered his hole; when the disappointed Caṇḍāla went away, Lomaśa requested Palita not to misunderstand him if he, when he became free, jumped up the tree without conversing with Palita (akṛtvā saṁvidaṁ kāṁcit sahasāham upaplutaḥ/ kṛtajñaṁ kṛtakalyāṇaṁ kaccin māṁ nābhiśaṅkase 12. 136. 119); Lomaśa asked the mouse to trust him and come close to him as he wanted to honour Palita who had saved him; Lomaśa asked Palita to be his minister and instruct him like a father (amātyo me bhava prājña piteva hi praśādhi mām 12. 136. 126); the counsel (mantra) of the mouse and the strength (bala) of the cat together would win victories for them (12. 136. 127); but Palita pointed out to Lomaśa that he fell into the trap due to his thoughtlessness (capalatvāt 12. 136. 142); thoughtlessness does not help the person himself, how can it help others ?; Palita plainly told the cat that he wanted the mouse to move close to him because he was the food of the cat; Palita refused to go near Lomaśa when that was the cat's dinner time; Lomaśa made one more plea to Palita describing himself to be the knower of duties (dharmajña), appreciative of the merits of others (guṇajña), grateful for the good act (kṛtajña), and fond of friends (mitreṣu vatsala 12. 136. 179); if the mouse forsook the cat the latter would die; Palita, however, remained firm and advised Lomaśa to protect himself from the Caṇḍāla; hearing Caṇḍāla's name, the frightened Lomaśa quickly entered his hole, and Palita entered his 12. 136. 21-191.

  C.   Use in the epic war: (1) Arjuna arranged the Pāṇḍava army according to this Vyūha on the first day of the war 6. 19. 6-7, 35; Bhīma led it (bhīmaseno 'graṇīs teṣām) 6. 19. 18, (dṛṣṭvāgrato bhīmasenam) 6. 19. 44, (bhīmaseno…pracakarṣa mahat sainyam) 6. 19. 32; 6. 19. 8, 9; also in the forefront stood Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Nakula, Sahadeva, and Dhṛṣtaketu; Nakula and Sahadeva acted as the protectors of the wheels of Bhīma's chariot (cakrarakṣau 6. 19. 20), and the sons of Draupadī and Abhimanyu protected Bhīma from behind (pṛṣṭhagopāḥ 6. 19. 20); Dhṛṣṭadyumna, helped by the Prabhadrakas, offered protection to all of them (6. 19. 21); the king (Virāṭa ?), surrounded by an army, akṣauhiṇī strong, together with his brothers and sons guarded them from behind; Śikhaṇḍin, guarded by Arjuna, followed them; Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki) protected Arjuna from behind (pṛṣṭhagopa) and Yudhāmanyu and Uttamaujas acted as his wheelprotectors (cakrarakṣau); Yudhiṣṭhira, with elephants, took position in the middle; the Pāñcāla king Yajñasena with an army, akṣauhiṇī strong, marched behind Virāṭa; Dhṛṣṭadyumna, having moved from his position, with his brothers and sons, protected Yudhiṣṭhira from behind; hundreds and thousands of foot-soldiers moved in the front to protect Bhīmasena, while ten thousand elephants followed Yudhiṣṭhira 6. 19. 18-31; according to 6. 22. 1-6, where the name of the Vyūha is not mentioned but the description of which apparently applies to the arrangement of the Pāṇḍava army on the first day, Yudhiṣṭhira himself directed the contingents (anīkāni) of his army to counter the Vyūha (Sarvatobhadra) of Bhīṣma; Śikhaṇḍin's contingent stood in the middle, protected by Arjuna (also 6. 22. 14); Dhṛṣṭadyumna's contingent was protected by Bhīma himself; the contingent on the right side of the Vyūha (anīkaṁ dakṣiṇam) was protected by Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki); Yudhiṣṭhira's chariot was stationed in the midst of elephants; Bhīma, along with Nakula and Sahadeva, is said to be the guard of the chariot of the hero (vīrarathasya goptā i. e. Arjuna ? Dhṛṣṭadyumna ?), but his position seems to be in the front of the army (senāgragatam) 6. 22. 12-13; in many respects, this description of the Vyūha agrees with that of the Vajra given above (6. 19. 18-31); (2) On the seventh day of the war Yudhiṣṭhira himself used the Vajravyūha for his army (of which no details are available) to counter the Maṇḍalavyūha of the Kaurava army 6. 77. 21.

Meeting with Rāma: Gandharva Viśvāvasu advised Rāma to approach Sugrīva for help in his search for Sītā and gave him Sugrīva's address who lived with his four counsellors on the mountain Ṛśyamūka, near Pampā; according to Viśvāvasu Sugrīva knew Rāvaṇa's whereabouts 3. 263. 39-42; Lakṣmaṇa while comforting Rāma who was grieving over Sītā's loss suggested to meet Sugrīva; they saw Sugrīva and four other monkeys (vānarān pañca 3. 264. 9) on the Ṛśyamūka mountain (also 3. 147. 31); Sugrīva sent Hanūmant to them; having talked with him, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa approached Sugrīva and became friends (also 3. 147. 32; 3. 264. 57, 60; 3. 266 62); the monkeys showed to Rāma Sītā's upper garment (vāsaḥ 3. 264. 12) which inspired confidence in him; Rāma consecrated Sugrīva as the chief of the monkeys (sugrīvaṁ plavagādhipam/pṛthivyāṁ vānaraiśvarye svayaṁ rāmo 'bhyaṣecayat 3. 264. 13; 3. 266. 6); Rāma promised to kill Vālin in battle and Sugrīva promised help in getting back Sītā (also 3. 258. 3); Sugrīva then went to Kiṣkindhā and roared near Vālin's residence to challenge him for a fight; when asked by Vālin whose help Sugrīva had secured his wife Tārā told him that Rāma had become friend of Sugrīva since both had comparable enemies (tulyārimitratāṁ prāptaḥ 3. 264. 21); when told further by Tārā that Sugrīva and others were quite capable of destroying Vālin, he suspected that Tārā loved Sugrīva; Vālin went out of his residence and reminded Sugrīva that formerly on many occasions he had defeated Sugrīva but not killed him since Sugrīva was his kinsman (mukto jñātir iti jñātvā 3. 264. 27); Sugrīva, while alerting Rāma, retorted that although Vālin had deprived Sugrīva of his kingdom and his wife he wanted to show him how much of his lifeforce still remained with him (hṛtadārasya me rājan hṛtarājyasya ca tvayā/kiṁ nu jīvitasāmarthyam iti viddhi samāgatam 3. 264. 29); the two brothers were then engaged in a duel; during the fight, the one could not be distinguished from the other; hence Hanūmant put a garland around the neck of Sugrīva; Sugrīva with garland around his neck compared with the great mountain Malaya circled by a garland of clouds (3. 264. 34); Rāma then could correctly aim arrow at Vālin; when Vālin died Sugrīva got Kiṣkindhā and Tārā (also 3. 147. 32); when Rāma lived on the mountain Mālyavant, Sugrīva waited on him (3. 264. 1-40; 3. 266. 1); Rāma suspected Sugrīva to have become ungrateful (kṛtaghna 3. 266. 8) and hence not active in making efforts to find Sītā (anudyukta 3. 266. 10); he abused him as the very low in his family (kulādhama), foolish (mūḍha) and an outcaste among the monkeys (vānarāpasada) 3. 266. 6, 8; Rāma wanted Lakṣmaṇa to remind Sugrīva that he had killed Vālin for Sugrīva's sake and if he did not want to fulfil the agreement (na jānīte samayapratipādanam 3. 266. 9), Rāma would send him also along the path of Vālin; if, on the other hand, Sugrīva wanted to exert himself for Rāma's cause, he should present himself before Rāma; Lakṣmaṇa was received by Sugrīva and his wife with all humility; with folded hands Sugrīva informed Lakṣmaṇa that he was neither ungrateful nor dull-witted; he had not remained idle and had sent monkeys in all directions in search of Sītā (also 3. 147. 3233); they have been asked to report back within a month, and Rāma would get the good news within five days; Lakṣmaṇa was happy to learn this and he honoured Sugrīva; the two then met Rāma on the Mālyavant; the monkeys informed Sugrīva that Hanūmant, Aṅgada and other monkey-chiefs who were sent to the south had returned and were enjoying the Madhuvana; from their behaviour Sugrīva inferred that they must have been successful in their mission and informed Rāma accordingly; Hanūmant and others met Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, and Sugrīva and bowed to them 3. 266. 5-32; being friend of Rāma Sugrīva had enquired through Hanūmant about the welfare of Sītā; Sītā had heard of Sugrīva from the Rākṣasa Avindhya 3. 266. 62, 65. 

  F.   Part in the war with Rāvaṇa: At the instance of Sugrīva many monkey-chiefs came with their troops to help Rāma in war; they encamped near Kiṣkindhā with the consent of Sugrīva; on an auspicious day, under a favourable constellation, and at an approved hour (tithau praśaste nakṣatre muhūrte cābhipūjīte 3. 267. 14), Rāma and Sugrīva marched towards the south; when they reached the ocean Rāma held consultations with Sugrīva about the means to cross the ocean 3. 267. 1, 13-15, 23-24; when Vibhīṣaṇa came to Rāma, Sugrīva suspected him of being a spy 3. 267. 47; during the war Sugrīva fought a duel with Virūpākṣa 3. 269. 8; when Kumbhakarṇa struck terror in the hearts of Tāra and the other monkey-chiefs, Sugrīva attacked Kumbhakarṇa and struck him on his head with a Śāla tree; but this had no effect on the demon; Kumbhakarṇa overpowered Sugrīva and tried to forcibly take him away; seeing that, Lakṣmaṇa attacked Kumbhakarṇa 3. 271. 6-10; after Kumbhakarṇa's death Rāvaṇa sent Indrajit to kill Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, and Sugrīva 3. 272. 2, 5; Sugrīva with other monkey-chiefs surrounded Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa when they fell on the ground struck by the arrows of Indrajit; Sugrīva rid them of arrows with the powerful viśalyā herb and by using a divine spell (viśalyayā mahauṣadhyā divyamantraprayuktayā 3. 273. 6); Sugrīva with others, applied water sent by Kubera to the eyes so that they could see invisible beings 3. 273. 3, 6, 7. 

  G.   After the war: Rāma crossed the ocean back to Kiṣkindhā with Sugrīva and his other ministers (yathāmukhyair amātyaiḥ 3. 275. 52) in the Puṣpaka vimāna; they all then went to Ayodhyā; when Rāma was consecrated on the throne he consented to the departure of Sugrīva and others to their homes 3. 275. 50-59, 66. 

  H.   Comparisons: Fight between Bhīma and Kirmīra, between Bhīma and Jaṭāsura, and between Ghaṭotkaca and Alāyudha compared to the one between Vālin and Sugrīva 3. 12. 47; 3. 154. 49; 7. 153. 27.

  A.   Designation: Yādavī 16. 8. 7; Dāśārhī 2. 3. 24. 

  B.   Equipment: (1) Furnished with hundreds of royal seats (siṁhāsanāni); parts of them were made of gold, they were variegated due to gems and corals set in them, were lustrous like burning fire and were spread with precious covers, (jāmbūnadāṅgāni spardhyāstaraṇavanti ca/ maṇividrumacitrāṇi jvalītāgniprabhāṇi ca// bhejire puruṣavyāghrā…siṁhāsanāni śataśaḥ) 1. 212. 13-14; (2) A war-drum was placed in it; it was adorned with gold and, when struck, it produced loud sound (bherīṁ sāṁnāhikīṁ/…mahāghoṣāṁ jāmbūnadapariṣkṛtām) 1. 212. 11. 

  C.   Management: The Sabhā was supervised by a Sabhāpāla whose duty was to beat the drum and alert the citizens in the event of an emergency (see the next). 

  D.   Purpose: Whenever an emergency arose the Sabhāpāla beat the bherī to produce loud sound; hearing it, the agitated Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas would leave aside their food and drink and rush to the Sabhā to know the nature of the emergency 1. 212. 11-12. 

  E.   Epic events: (1) When Subhadrā was forcibly abducted by Arjuna, the soldiers accompanying her rushed to the Sudharmā Sabhā and acquainted the Sabhāpāla with what had happened; when the Vṛṣṇi heroes who gathered in the Sabhā sat down on the royal seats, the Sabhāpāla told them about the abduction of Subhadrā by Arjuna 1. 212. 9-10, 15; (2) After the mutual killings by the Yādavas, when Arjuna reached Dvārakā he entered the Sudharmā to meet the ministers of the Vṛṣṇi heroes; when he occupied a seat in the Sabhā the citizens gathered around him 16. 8. 7-8. 

  F.   Comparison: Sudharmā was not equal to the unrivalled Sabhā constructed by Maya for the Pāṇḍavas (sabhā tu sā mahārāja… na dāśārhī sudharmā vā…tādṛśī…yāṁ cakre 'pratimāṁ mayaḥ) 2. 3. 19, 24.

*1st word in left half of page p72  (+offset) in original book.Sumukha^1  : m.: A mythical serpent, living in Bhogavatī Purī 5. 101. 23, 1. 

  A.   Birth: Born in the kula of Airāvata, grandson of Āryaka, son of Cikura; his mother was the daughter of Vāmana 5. 101. 23, 24; his father was killed by Vainateya (Garuḍa) 5. 101. 24. 

  B.   Eminence: A big snake (mahānāga 5. 103. 5); excellent snake, king or chief of snakes (bhujagottama 5. 101. 25; nāgarāj 5. 101. 23; nāgapati 5. 101. 26). 

  C.   Description: Lustrous, pleasing to look at 5. 101. 19; high banner of his race (vaṁśasya mahān ketubhūtaḥ) 5. 101. 20; he impressed Mātali with such qualities as attentiveness, fortitude, handsomeness and young age (praṇidhānena dhairyeṇa rūpeṇa vayasā ca me/manaḥ praviṣṭaḥ) 5. 101. 21; also marked with such qualities as good character, purity and self-control (sumukhasya guṇaiś caiva śīlaśaucadamādibhiḥ) 5. 102. 10. 

  D.   Marriage with Guṇakeśī: Mātali while searching in the Nāgaloka a bride-groom for his daughter Guṇakesī happened to notice the serpent Sumukha in Bhogavatī Purī; he was happy to see him 5. 101. 22; when told by Nārada who Sumukha was, Mātali chose him as his son-inlaw; he told Nārada accordingly and requested Nārada to make effort to obtain Sumukha 5. 101. 21, 25, 26; Nārada approached Āryaka, Sumukha's grand-father, and told him what Mātali had in mind; Āryaka was told that although Sumukha had no father he was chosen by Mātali on account of his good qualities 5. 101. 6, 10; Āryaka was happy to hear the proposal but he was distressed because Garuḍa had announced his intention to eat up Sumukha after a month 5. 102. 15; 5. 103. 5; the threat was bound to come true as Garuḍa wanted to feed his large progeny by killing Sumukha 5. 102. 16; 5. 103. 5; Mātali then proposed to take Sumukha with him to meet Indra and make effort to prolong the remaining life-span of Sumukha and thwart Garuḍa in carrying out his threat 5. 102. 17-21; Viṣṇu, who happened to be present when all met Indra, asked Indra to give amṛta to Sumukha and make him (immortal) like other gods; Viṣṇu desired Sumukha and the rest to get what they wanted; Indra, however, asked Viṣṇu himself to give amṛta to Sumukha; when asked by Viṣṇu again, Indra gave only long life (āyur uttamam 5. 102. 27) to Sumukha but not amṛta; on obtaining the boon Sumukha's face shone with brilliance (labdhvā varaṁ tu sumukhaḥ sumukhaḥ saṁbabhūva ha 5. 102. 28); having obtained wife as desired Sumukha went home 5. 102. 23-28; Garuḍa was extremely angry to know that he was deprived of Sumukha; he blamed Indra for acting as he willed and announced that since Sumukha was no longer available to him he would not kill any other serpent 5. 103. 1, 2, 6, 15.

*1st word in left half of page p73  (+offset) in original book.Surabhi^1, Surabhī  : f.: A mythical cow. 

  A.   Origin: (1) Daughter of Dakṣa, hence called Dākṣāyaṇī 1. 93. 8 (Surabhī); 12. 167. 3; 13. 82. 26; once, (Dakṣa) Prajāpati satisfied with drinking amṛta, emitted fragrance (surabhi) while belching; he saw his daughter Surabhi coming out of his mouth produced by belching (udgārasaṁvṛtlā) 13. 76. 17, 18; hence described as ‘born of nectar’ (amṛtasaṁbhavā) 5. 100. 1; (2) Daughter of Brahman 13. 128. 10 (Surabhī). 

  B.   Description: devī ‘divine’ 1. 93. 8; 2. 11. 29; 13. 82. 30, 31, 34; 13. 151. 7 and śubhā, śobhanā ‘brilliant, shining’ her special epithets 3. 10. 8, 15; 12. 167. 3; 13. 82. 29, 31, 37; ‘gentle’ (saumyā) 13. 151. 7, yet ‘very proud’ (atigarvitā) 1. 93, 8; ‘blameless’ (aninditā) and ‘distinguished’ (mahābhāgā) 5. 100. 3, 13. 82. 30, 31. 

  C.   Qualities: Surabhi yields nectar as milk (amṛtadhenuṁ payomucam/sā sṛṣṭā…kṣaramāṇā payo'mṛtam 13. 128. 10); Surabhi yields milk after reaching the outskirts of the Kāñcana mountain on the shore of the ocean in which flows golden water (kāncanaśailasya kāñcanāmbuvahasya ca/ udadhes tīram āsādya) 5. 108. 10. 

  D.   Progeny: She gave birth to a cow (Nandinī) by Kaśyapa; Vasiṣṭha got Nandinī as his homadhenu 1. 93. 8; mother of cows (gavām mātā) 3. 219. 32; 5. 100. 1; mother of cows yielding nectarlike milk (payo'mṛtam) 13. 128. 10; mother of cows who are themselves mothers of the world (lokamātaraḥ) 13. 76. 18; four cows born to her, Surūpā, Haṁsakā, Subhadrā and Sarvakāmadughā, dwell in four directions protecting and guarding them 5. 100. 7-10; mother of bulls 3. 10. 7. 

  E.   Eminence: (1) The Goloka granted to Surabhī by Brahman stands above the three worlds; as decreed by Brahman, Surabhī was to get there all human and divine enjoyments and happiness of dwelling in heaven; her worlds are provided with all objects of desire and neither death, nor old age, nor fire steps in there; neither wretchedness nor inauspiciousness is met with in the Goloka; the Goloka could be obtained by mortals only by practising great austerities and doing good deeds 13. 82. 3740; (2) She is mentioned in the daivatavaṁśa narrated by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira; recitation of this vaṁśa destroys sin 5. 151. 7, 2; (3) She is mentioned among those who are present in the sabhā of Brahmadeva 2. 11. 29. 

  F.   Functions: Residing in the rasātala, the seventh world of the earth, she lets milk flow continually which is produced from the essence of the earth and which, as a rasa, constitutes the essence of all the six rasas; out of her milk, falling on the earth, is created the sea of milk; water of the ocean that was churned by the gods and the demons was mixed with the milk of Surabhi and her four daughters; milk oozing from Surabhi provides nectar (sudhā) to those whose food is sudhā, svadhā for the manes, and amṛta for those who live on amṛta 5, 100. 1, 2, 4, 7-13. 

  G.   Events: (1) Seeing Aditi practising severe austerities, Surabhi did the same on the peak of the Kailāsa mountain, standing on one foot and resorting to the highest yoga (paramaṁ yogam āsthitā 13. 82. 28); this she did for ten thousand and ten hundred years; tormented by her austerities, gods, big snakes (mahoragāḥ), and sages went to her with Brahman; Brahman asked her the reason for practising austerities and granted her a boon; Surabhī (surabhy uvāca) did not ask for anything saying that Brahman's satisfaction with her austerities was as good as a boon; since Surabhī (13. 82. 33) practised austerities not craving for anything (alobhakāmyayā tapasā 13. 82. 34) Brahman granted her immortality and a world of her own to be known as Goloka 12. 82. 26 35; this narration forms part of an old Itihāsa which includes a dialogue between Pitāmaha and Indra 13. 82. 6; (2) Surabhi once went to heaven and cried aloud; Indra took pity on her and asked her why she was crying; she wept for her son, the bull, who though weak and emaciated was forced to draw the plough and was pierced with a goad; one of the two bulls yoked to the plough was strong and it carried the yoke ahead of the other (? ekas tatra balopeto dhuram udvahate 'dhikām 3. 10. 12); the other who was weak and lean bore the burden with difficulty; Surabhi grieved because of the torture of the weak bull; when Indra asked her that while she had thousands of sons who were tortured why did she weep over a particular one, Surabhi replied that all her sons were equal to her but she had more compassion for the weak; on hearing what Surabhī (3. 10. 17) had said Indra realized that a son was more than one's life; narrating this, Vyāsa advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra to adopt the attitude of Surabhi and have more sympathy for those among his sons who were reduced to a wretched condition (i. e. for the Pāṇḍavas) 3. 10. 5-19; the dialogue between Surabhi and Indra called a great and excellent ākhyāna (mahad ākhyānam uttamam/surabhyāś caiva saṁvādam indrasya ca viśāṁ pate 3. 10. 6); (3) Surabhi, while taking the oath to prove that she had not stolen the lotus (puṣkara) of Agastya said: “let (the cow) who has stolen your puṣkara be milked with her feet tied by the rope made from balvaja, the milk-pot used to collect milk be made of kāṁsya, and the calf used to induce her to give milk be not her own” 13. 96. 41; (4) Surabhi happened to stand in the sky when the body of Rājadharman (the king of the cranes) was being cremated by his Rākṣasa friend; milk streamed from her udder (sā babhūva payasvinī), and foam from her mouth mixed with milk dropped down on the body of Rājadharman which brought him back to life 12. 167. 1-5; (5) Once, froth from the mouth of Surabhī's (13. 128. 10) calf fell on Śiva's body; angered, Śiva burnt all the cows who then became of different colours; Brahman (lokaguru) pacified Śiva and gave the bull (i. e. that calf) to Śiva to serve him as vehicle and as a distinguishing mark on his banner (vṛṣaṁ cemaṁ dhvajārthaṁ me dadau vāhanam eva ca) 13. 128. 11-12. 

  H.   Mahāgraha: She is included among the afflictions (mahāgraha 3. 219. 41) which are not favourable to children until they are sixteen years old and are favourable afterwards; a bird perches on her head and eats the children with her 3. 219. 32, 41, 22.

*1st word in left half of page p482  (+offset) in original book.Suvīra, Sauvīra (Sauvīraka)  : m. (pl.): Name of a Janapada and its people; they are often mentioned along with Sindhus. 

  A.   Location: Listed by Saṁjaya among the northern Janapadas (also called Deśas 6. 10. 68) of Bhāratavarṣa (ata ūrdhvaṁ janapadān nibodha) 6. 10. 37, 5; (kāśmīrāḥ sindhusauvīrā…) 6. 10. 52; once also referred to as rāṣṭra (3. 252. 1). 

  B.   Description of their warriors: Excellent young heroes (sauvīravīrāḥ pravarā yuvāno …) 3. 249. 12; brave (śūra) 6. 18. 13; strong (balin) 3. 249. 12; 7. 85. 73; 6. 20. 10 (?); excellent attackers (pravarāṇāṁ prahāriṇām) 3. 255. 9; ready to lay their bodies (tanutyaj) 6. 18. 14; fighting with sharp lances (nakharaprāsayodhin) 7. 85. 73; 12. 102. 3. 

  C.   Characteristics of the people: Karṇa while deriding Śalya mentioned Sindhus and Sauvīras as those who did not know dharma since they were Mlecchas born in sinful countries and those who could not discern between dharma and adharma; they wholeheartedly treaded on despicable paths (ā keśāgrān nakhāgrāc ca vaktavyeṣu kuvartmasu//…sindhusauvīrā dharmaṁ vidyuḥ kathaṁ tv iha/pāpadeśodbhavā mlecchā dharmāṇām avicakṣaṇāḥ//) 8. 27. 90-91 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 8. 40. 42: vaktavyeṣu garhaṇīyeṣu); he also told him that according to a Rākṣasī, Sindhus and Sauvīras were in general despicable; this was reported by a certain Brāhmaṇa in the Kuru assembly (vasātisindhusauvīrā iti prāyo vikutsitāḥ) 8. 30. 41, 46-47. 

  D.   Epic events: (1) Kṛṣṇa recalled that Śiśupāla had abducted the unwilling wife of Babhru on her arrival at Suvīra country from Dvārakā (?)

the army of Kauravas which included warriors from Sindhu, Suvīra and Kuru countries was scattered by the swift arrows of both Karṇa and Bhīma fighting with each other (tato vyudastaṁ tat sainyaṁ sindhusauvīrakauravam/protsāritaṁ…); afflicted by arrows and with their horses and men killed and chariots broken (hatāśvanaravāhanāḥ) they left Bhīma and Karṇa and ran in all directions; thinking that the gods were deluding them for the benefit of Bhīma (nūnaṁ pārthārtham evāsmān mohayanti divaukasaḥ) they stopped shooting arrows and became spectators (śarapātaṁ samutsṛjya sthitā yuddhadidṛkṣavaḥ) 7. 113. 7, 11-14; Karṇa was enraged to see the destruction all around of the army of Kuru, Sindhu and Suvīra countries (kurusauvīrasaindhavānāṁ balakṣayam…sarvataḥ), the dead bodies of elephants, and the earth covered with the armours, banners and weapons 7. 114. 17-18; (13) On the fifteenth day, when Dhṛtarāṣṭra heard the death of Droṇa he remembered that Sātyaki had formerly defeated the large army of a king (not named) of the Suvīra country (sauvīrarājasya pramathya mahatīṁ camūṁ) 7. 9. 29; (14) When the war was over, Gāndhārī, on the battle-field, pointed out to Kṛṣṇa women of the Sindhu and Suvīra countries who sat around the dead body of Jayadratha keeping watch over him (tam etāḥ paryupāsante rakṣamāṇā mahābhujam/sindhusauvīraº ºstriyaḥ/) 11. 22. 9. 11. 

  E.

  D.   Epic event: Arjuna, while returning to the residence of gods after killing the Nivātakavaca demons, saw on way the town Hiraṇyapura 3. 170. 1; on hearing from Mātali about the demons occupying the town (3. 170. 8-10), Arjuna asked Mātali to take him to Hiraṇyapura so that he might kill the demons; accordingly Mātali drove him there quickly in the heavenly chariot 3. 170. 13-15; the battle between Arjuna and the demons in the town described (3. 170. 16-50); when the demons were being killed they employed māyā of the demons and flew up in the sky together with the town (te vadhyamānā daiteyāḥ puram āsthāya tat punaḥ/kham utpetuḥ sanagarā māyām āsthāya dānavīm//) 3. 170. 21; Arjuna steadied the town along with the demons and when broken by his iron arrows it fell down on the ground 3. 170. 26-27; Mātali praised Arjuna for his feat of destroying Hiraṇyapura,--a feat which could not be accomplished even by gods and Asuras 3. 170. 51-54; when the town was destroyed and the demons were killed (vidhvaste 'tha pure tasmin dānaveṣu hateṣu ca) the women of the demons came out of the town weeping aloud in grief 3. 170. 55-57; Arjuna, after destroying Hiraṇyapura and killing the Asuras (hiraṇyapuram ārujya nihatya ca mahāsurān), returned to Indra with Mātali 3. 170. 60-61; hearing from Mātali in details the exploits of Arjuna, (hiraṇyapuraghātaṁ ca māyānāṁ ca nivāraṇam), Indra exclaimed ‘well done’ 3. 170. 63-64; this exploit of Arjuna is referred to: (i) by Bhīṣma, when he referred to the boon granted by Nara and Nārāyaṇa to Indra, while addressing Duryodhana (tābhyāṁ ca sahitaḥ śakro vijigye daityadānavān//nara indrasya saṁgrāme hatvā śatrūn…/paulomān kālakhañjāṁś ca) 5. 48. 13-14 (in the earlier account in 3. 170 Indra is not mentioned as taking part in the battle); (ii) again by Bhīṣma while reminding Duryodhana about the exploits of Arjuna (dānavānāṁ sahasrāṇi hiraṇyapuravāsinām/ hatāny ekarathenājau) 5. 166. 34 (this could also be a reference to Nivātakavacas of Hiraṇyapura^1); (iii) by Arjuna while telling Uttara his earlier exploits (aham indrasya vacanāt saṁgrāme 'bhyahanaṁ purā/paulomān kālakhañjāṁś ca) 4. 56. 9 (actually, according to the account in 3. 170, Indra had not asked Arjuna to kill Paulomas and Kālakhañjas (there called Kālakeyas); Arjuna did this on his own; Indra had asked him to destroy the Nivātakavacas of Hiraṇyapura^1 (3. 165. 10-11) which is mentioned by Arjuna in 4. 56. 11); (iv) by Yudhiṣṭhira when, while lamenting over the death of Abhimanyu, he referred to the feats of Arjuna (hiraṇyapuravāsinaḥ …paulomāḥ sagaṇā hatāḥ) 7. 49. 17; (v) possibly by Duryodhana while reminding Droṇa of Arjuna's exploits (dānavānāṁ sahasrāṇi hiraṇyapuravāsinām/vijigye puruṣavyāghraḥ) 7. 160. 19. 

  E.   Simile: When the demons were killed the town Hiraṇyapura became unfit to be seen like a pond with its elephants killed or like a forest the trees of which had gone dry (hatanāgam iva hradam/śuṣkavṛkṣam ivāraṇyam adṛśyam abhavat puram//) 3. 170. 59.

Characteristics: (1) Their close relationship with the Pāṇḍavas: The Pāṇḍavas had no friends other than the Andhakas and the Vṛṣṇis and vice versa (asmākaṁ…mitram anyan na vidyate/ param andhakavṛṣṇibhyaḥ…//tathaivāndhakavṛṣṇīnāṁ...asmatto mitram anyan na vidyate//) 7. 169. 48-49; it was on account of their friendship with the Pāṇḍavas that the Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis did not pay them tribute at the time of the Rājasūya (dvau karaṁ na prayacchetāṁ…sakhyenāndhakavṛṣṇayaḥ) 2. 48. 42; (2) Fortunate, strong, and difficult to be assailed, the Andhakas and the Vṛṣṇis had become prosperous by being ever industrious (…sumahābhāgā balavanto durāsadāḥ/nityotthānena saṁpannā nāradāndhakavṛṣṇayaḥ//) 12. 82. 8; (3) The Andhakas and the Vṛṣṇis were not subjugated by Jarāsandha due to either their policy or due to good luck (nayenāndhakavṛṣṇayaḥ/te na tasya vaśaṁ jagmuḥ kevalaṁ daivam eva vā//) 5. 50. 39; (4) All the Andhakas and the Vṛṣṇis were attached to Kṛṣṇa (sarve cāndhakavṛṣṇayḥ/tvayyāsaktā…) 12. 82. 29; they relied on the wisdom of Kṛṣṇa (vṛṣṇyandhakāḥ…yasya prajñām upāsate) 5. 84. 4; Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis, and Bhojas were led by Kṛṣṇa; relying on the counsel of Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa) they subjugated the enemies and gave delight to their friends (andhakāś ca vārṣṇeyabhojāḥ kaukurāḥ…/upāsīnā vāsudevasya buddhiṁ vigṛhya śatrūn suhṛdo nandayanti//vṛṣṇyandhakā…kṛṣṇapraṇītāḥ) 5. 28. 11-12; (5) According to Yudhiṣṭhira, Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas and all the Yādavas were like Indra, spirited, who proved their valour, very strong and who enjoyed pleasures (vṛṣṇyandhakā…sarva evendrakalpāḥ/manasvinaḥ satyaparākramāś ca mahābalā yādavā bhogavantaḥ) 5. 28. 12; (6) Arjuna described them as brave, high-souled, proud like lion, very strong, capable of bearing the strokes of gadā, parigha and śakti, having arms like parigha, having strong arms (ye te śūrā mahātmānaḥ siṁhadarpā mahābalāḥ/ bhojavṛṣṇyandhakā…//gadāparighaśaktīnāṁ sahāḥ parīghabāhavaḥ) 16. 9. 9-10; (7) Vyāsa too called them high-souled (diṣtam etan mahātmanām) 16. 9. 26; (8) (According to Bhūriśravas, however, the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas could be treacherous); he, therefore, while blaming Arjuna for his misdeed asked him why he regarded them as authority (vṛṣṇyandhakāḥ kathaṁ pārtha pramāṇaṁ bhavatā kṛtāḥ) 7. 118. 15.

(5) A great festival of the Raivataka mountain was observed by the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; they, along with the Bhojas, gave gifts to thousands of Brāhmaṇas in that festival (tasmin raivatake girau/vṛṣṇyandhakānām abhavat sumahān utsavo nṛpa// tatra dānaṁ dadur vīrā…bhojavṛṣṇyandhakāś caiva) 1. 211. 1-2; (6) When Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas heard the sound of the bherī sounded by the Sabhāpāla, they were agitated; they left their food and drink and rushed to the Hall; there the great heroes among the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas took their royal seats (kṣubdhās tenātha śabdena bhojavṛṣṇyandhakās tadā/annapānam apāsyātha samāpetuḥ sabhāṁ tataḥ// …bhejire…vṛṣṇyandhakamahārathāḥ/ siṁhāsanāni śataśaḥ) 1. 212. 12, 14;

(9) Jarāsandha was neglected by Andhakas, Kukuras and Vṛṣṇis on considerations of policy (kukurāndhakaiḥ/ vṛṣṇibhiś ca…nītihetor upekṣitaḥ//) 2. 17. 27; (10) Andhakas, Yādavas and Bhojas had deserted Kaṁsa; similarly Vidura wanted Dhṛtarāṣṭra to desert Duryodhana (andhakā yādavā bhojāḥ sametāḥ kaṁsam atyajan) 2. 55. 6; later Kṛṣṇa told the same thing (here Vṛṣṇis are mentioned along with Andhakas) to Bhīṣma and others (kaṁsam ekaṁ parityajya kulārthe…saṁbhūya sukham edhante…andhakavṛṣṇayaḥ) 5. 126. 39; (11) Having heard about the Pāṇḍavas' exile, the Bhojas went with Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas to meet them in the Dvaitavana (bhojāḥ...vṛṣṇayaś cāndhakaiḥ saha…samājagmur mahāvane) 3. 13. 1; (12) When Pradyumna was aflicated by the arrows of Śālva, the army of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas wailed loudly (hāhākṛtam abhūt sarvaṁ vṛṣṇyandhakabalaṁ tadā) 3. 19. 2;

(19) Kṛtavarman went to Duryodhana to assist him with an army numbering one akṣauhiṇī of Bhojas and Andhakas (kṛtavarmā…bhojāndhakabalaiḥ saha/akṣauhiṇyaiva senāyā duryodhanam upāgamat) 5. 19. 17; (20) Saṁjaya, while conveying the message from the Kauravas told Yudhiṣṭhira that he (Saṁjaya) would consider Yudhiṣṭhira's living by begging in the kingdom of the Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis better than waging a war for kingdom (bhaikṣacaryām andhakavṛṣṇirājye śreyo manye na tu yuddhena rājyam) 5. 27. 2; (21) Kṛṣṇa told Duryodhana that he was not alone but the Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis were with him; in the terrible form that he showed in the assembly, Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis were in front of him (ihaiva…andhakavṛṣṇayaḥ) 5. 129. 3;

(24) Sātyaki said to Dhṛṣṭadyumna that he deserved to be discharged by the Pāṇḍavas and all the Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis (since he boasted after killing Droṇa) (yāpyas tvam asi…sarvaiś cāndhakavṛṣṇibhiḥ) 7. 169. 11; (25) Yudhiṣṭhira, dejected at the destruction of the Pāṇḍava army by Nārāyaṇāstra, asked Sātyaki to leave the battlefield along with Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas and return home (sātyake tvaṁ ca gacchasva vṛṣṇyandhakavṛto gṛhān) 7. 170. 26; (26) Kṛṣṇa told Aśvatthāman that the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka heroes did not at any time ask him to part with his cakra (vṛṣṇyandhakamahārathaiḥ/ noktapūrvam idaṁ jātu) 10. 12. 33; (27) When Kṛṣṇa returned to Dvārakā after the war, Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas came out to meet him; Kṛṣṇa honoured them and enquired about their well-being (upayātaṁ tu vārṣṇeyaṁ bhojavṛṣṇyandhakās tadā/abhyāgacchan…//sa tān abhyarcya medhāvī pṛṣṭvā ca kuśalaṁ tadā) 14. 58. 17-18; (28) Abhimanyu had told Uttarā that her son would go to the families of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas and learn from them the Dhanurveda, the use of astras and the whole Nītiśāstra (gatvā vṛṣṇyandhakakulaṁ dhanurvedaṁ grahīṣyati/astrāṇi ca vicitrāṇi nītiśāstraṁ ca kevalam//) 14. 65. 24; (29) When Vyāsa arrived at Hāstinapura, the Kuru leaders (the Pāṇḍavas), along with the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka heroes, worshipped him as was proper for them to do and waited on him (tasya (i. e. of Vyāsa) sarve yathānyāyaṁ pūjāṁ cakruḥ kurūdvahāḥ/saha vṛṣṇyandhakavyāghrair upāsāṁ cakrire tadā) 14. 70. 11; (30) Janamejaya asked Vaiśampāyana how the Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis were destroyed, and by whom were they cursed (kathaṁ vinaṣṭā bhagavann andhakā vṛṣṇibhiḥ saha//…kenānuśaptās te vīrāḥ kṣayaṁ vṛṣṇyandhakā yayuḥ) 16. 2. 1, 3; Vaiśampāyana then told about the curse of the sages, Viśvāmitra and others, to the effect that an iron pestle would be born to Sāmba for the destruction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; accordingly Sāmba gave birth to a large pestle of the size of a kiṁkara (shaft of a chariot ?) (vṛṣṇyandhakavināśāya musalam ghoram āyasam/…sāmbo 'yaṁ janayiṣyati//… sāmbo musalaṁ tad asūta vai/vṛṣṇyandhakavināśāya kiṁkarapratimaṁ mahat) 16. 2. 8, 15 (however, Nī. on Bom. Ed. 16. 1. 26: kiṁkaro yamadūtas tattulyam); (31) King Āhuka declared that the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas, from the day of his declaration, should not distil liquor in their houses (adyaprabhṛti sarveṣu vṛṣṇyanahakagṛheṣviha/surāsavo na kartavyaḥ sarvair nagaravāsibhiḥ) 16. 2. 18; (32) When the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas were maintaining vigil over their conduct, Kāla always moved round their houses; many bad omens including blowing of fierce strong winds, occurred indicating the destruction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; also whitish pigeons having red feet, goaded by Kāla, moved over their houses; when the conch Pāñcajanya was sounded in their houses, asses of harsh voice brayed in response (evaṁ prayatamānānāṁ vṛṣṇīnām andhakaiḥ saha/kālo gṛhāṇi sarveṣām paricakrāma nityaśaḥ//) 16. 3. 1; (utpedire mahāvātā dāruṇāś ca dine dine/vṛṣṇyandhakavināśāya bahavo romaharṣaṇāḥ//) 16. 3. 3; (pāṇḍurā raktapādāś ca vihagāḥ kālacoditāḥ/vṛṣṇyandhakānāṁ geheṣu kapotā vyacaraṁs tadā//) 16. 3. 6; (nadantaṁ pāñcajanyaṁ ca vṛṣṇyandhakaniveśane samantāt pratyavāśyanta rāsabhā dāruṇasvarāḥ//) 16. 3. 15; for other bad omens see 16. 3. 3-5, 7, 10-14, 17; 16. 4. 1-5; (33) The Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas, wishing to go out with their wives, decided to go for a tīrthayātrā; so they got ready food and drink, which included meat and wine, which they took with them; fond of liquor they went out of the town in vehicles, or on horses and elephants; they stayed at Prabhāsa; hearing that they had settled near the sea, Uddhava took leave of them; the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka heroes saw Uddhava leaving them; the food which was prepared for Brāhmaṇas, they gave to monkeys; then a great drinking bout began at Prabhāsa in which musical instruments were played upon and actors and dancers took part (tato jigamiṣantas te vṛṣṇyandhakamahārathāḥ/ sāntaḥpurās tadā tīrthayātrām aicchan...// tato bhojyaṁ ca bhakṣyaṁ ca peyaṁ cāndhakavṛṣṇayaḥ/bahu nānāvidhaṁ cakrur madyaṁ māṁsam anekaśaḥ//tataḥ sīdhuṣu saktāś ca niryayur nagarād bahiḥ/yānair aśvaiḥ gajaiś caiva…//) 16. 4. 6-8; 9-10; (tataḥ kālaparītās te vṛṣṇyandhakamahārathāḥ/apaśyann uddhavaṁ yāntam) 16. 4. 12; (brāhmaṇārtheṣu yat siddham annaṁ teṣāṁ mahātmanām/tad vānarebhyaḥ pradaduḥ surāgandhasamanvitam//tatas tūryaśatākīrṇaṁ naṭanastakasaṁkulam/ prāvartata mahāpānaṁ prabhāse…//) 16. 4. 13-14; (34) When Sātyaki severed the head of Kṛtavarman, Bhojas and Andhakas, goaded by the turn of Kāla, gathered round Sātyaki (ekībhūtās tataḥ sarve kālaparyāyacoditāḥ/bhojāndhakā…śaineyaṁ paryavārayan//) 16. 4. 29; angered, they, in a state of drunkenness struck Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki) with pots from which food was eaten; Bhojas then fought with Pradyumna, who had intervened to save Sātyaki, and Andhakas attacked Sātyaki, and killed both of them; Kṛṣṇa then killed those Bhojas and Andhakas who were in front of him with the pestle which arose out of the erakā grass held by Kṛṣṇa in his hand; whoever of them held the erakā in his hand, it became (a pestle like) vajra; the Andhakas, Bhojas, Śaineyas and Vṛṣṇis killed each other with that vajra-like pestle; in the tumult, the son killed the father and the father his son; Kukuras and Andhakas fell down as do the flies in fire (te tu pānamadāviṣṭāś coditāś caiva manyunā/ yuyudhānam athābhyaghnann ucchiṣṭhair bhājanais tadā//…rukmiṇinandanaḥ/tadantaram upādhāvan…//sa bhojaiḥ saha saṁyuktaḥ sātyakiś cāndhakaiḥ saha/ bahutvān nihatau tatra…//…erakāṇāṁ tadā muṣṭim kopāj jagrāha keśavaḥ//tad abhūn musalaṁ ghoraṁ vajrakalpam ayomayam/jaghāna tena kṛṣṇas tān ye 'sya pramukhato 'bhavan//tato 'ndhakāś ca bhojāś ca śaineyā vṛṣṇayas tathā/jaghnur anyonyam ākrande musalaiḥ kālacoditāḥ// yas teṣām erakāṁ kaścij jagrāha…/ vajrabhūteva sā rājann adṛśyata…//avadhīt pitaraṁ putraḥ pitā putraṁ ca bhārata/ …pataṁgā iva cāgnau te nyapatan kukurāndhakāḥ//) 16. 4. 31-41; (35) Kṛṣṇa, contemplating the destruction of Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis and Kurus, thought it was time for him to leave the world (sa cintayāno 'ndhakavṛṣṇināśaṁ kurukṣayaṁ caiva…mene tataḥ saṁkramaṇasya kālam) 16. 5. 18; (36) The Pāṇḍavas were very much grieved when they heard from Dāruka the destruction of Vārṣṇeyas, Bhojas, Kukuras and Andhakas (śrutvā vinaṣṭān vārṣṇeyān sabhojakukurāndhakān/) 16. 6. 2; (37) Arjuna seeing Dvārakā after the destruction of Yādavas compared it with a river of which Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas formed the water (tāṁ sa vṛṣṇyandhakajalāṁ…dvārakāsaritaṁ tadā/ …dadarśārjuno dhīmān) 16. 6. 8, 10; (38) Arjuna told the people of Dvārakā gathered in the assembly hall that he himself would take with him Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas to Śakraprastha; there Vajra would be their king; when Arjuna left Dvārakā, servants, elephant- and chariot-drivers of Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis, as also their sons, followed him; many thousands of women of Bhojas, Andhakas and Vṛṣṇīs, who had lost their husbands left Dvārakā to follow Arjuna; on their way to Indraprastha when they were attacked by Mlecchas (also called Dasyus 16. 8. 44, 47, 58, 60 or Ābhīras 16. 8. 45) the latter captured the women of Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas and took them away (śakraprastham ahaṁ neṣye vṛṣṇyandhakajanaṁ svayam/…vajro 'yaṁ bhavatāṁ rājā śakraprasthe bhaviṣyati//…bhṛtyās tv andhakavṛṣṇīnāṁ sādino rathinaś ca ye/…putrāś cāndhakavṛṣṇīnāṁ sarve pārtham anuvratāḥ/…bahūni ca sahasrāṇi prayutāny arbudāni ca/bhojavṛṣṇyandhakastrīṇāṁ hatanāthāni niryayuḥ//…vṛṣṇyandhakavarastriyaḥ/jagmur ādāya te mlecchāḥ) 16. 8. 10-11, 28-30, 34, 38, 61; (39) On his way to Hāstinapura, Arjuna told Vyāsa about the destruction of Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas due to mutual killing; they fought each other with erakā grass; a total of one thousand and five hundred of them was killed (bhojavṛṣṇyandhakā brahman anyonyaṁ tair hataṁ yudhi/ …ta erokābhir nihatāḥ…//hataṁ pañcaśataṁ teṣāṁ sahasraṁ bāhuśālinām/ nidhanaṁ samanuprāptaṁ samāsādyetaretaram) 16. 9. 9-11 (however, Nī. on Bom. Ed. 16. 8. 11: pañcaśataṁ sahasraṁ sahasraguṇitaṁ pañcalakṣāṇīty arthaḥ); Vyāsa consoled Arjuna by saying that the great heroes among Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas were destroyed due to the curse of a Brāhmaṇa and hence Arjuna should not grieve over the event; it was ordained for them (brahmaśāpavinirdagdhā vṛṣṇyandhakamahārathāḥ/vinaṣṭā…na tāñ śocitum arhasi/bhavitavyaṁ tathā tad dhi diṣṭam etan mahātmanām) 16. 9. 25-26; (40) On reaching Hāstinapura, Arjuna informed Yudhiṣṭhira what had happened to Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka people (ācaṣṭa tad yathāvṛttaṁ vṛṣṇyandhakajanaṁ prati) 16. 9. 38; (41) Having heard from Vaiśaṁpāyana about the battle fought with musala (i. e. with erakā blades fortified with the particles of musala) in the family of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas, Janamejaya asked him what the Pāṇḍavas did after that incident (evaṁ vṛṣṇyandhakakule śrutvā mausalam āhavam) 17. 1. 1 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 16. 1. 11: mausalaṁ musalakṛtaṁ kadanaṁ and on 16. 1. 13 (= Cr. Edn. 16. 2. 2): musalaiḥ erakālagnair musalakaṇaiḥ); (42) Indra showed to Yudhiṣṭhira, Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka heroes seated among the group gods Sādhyas, Vasus and Maruts (sādhyānām atha devānāṁ vasūnāṁ marutām api/gaṇeṣu paśya rājendra vṛṣṇyandhakamahārathān) 18. 4. 14.

Location below), it was also known as Pañcanada 8. 30. 62, 74; (dharmaṁ pāñcanadam) 8. 30. 65-66; name Bāhyālaya is doubtful; the text reads prāyo bāhyā layād ṛte (8. 30. 61) (Arjunamiśra explains prāyo bāhyā yathoktapradeśabahirbhūtāḥ/layāt madradeśāt, see Cr. Ed. Vol. 10, p. 267, Cr. App. for 8. 30. 61); perhaps the text is to be read as bāhyālayād ṛte 'except those who have their residence outside (the countries Kurus, Pāñcālas etc. just mentioned before); also cf. Editor's note on the stanza Cr. Ed. Vol. 10. p. 687).

Śatadru, Vipāśā, Irāvatī, Candrabhāgā, and Vitastā with Sindhu as the sixth (pañca nadyo vahanty etā…/śatadruś ca vipāśā ca tṛtīyerāvatī tathā/ candrabhāgā vitastā ca sindhuṣaṣṭhā bahirgatāḥ//āraṭṭā nāma te deśāḥ) 8. 30. 3536; pañcānāṁ sindhuṣaṣṭhānāṁ nadīnām ye 'ntarāśritāḥ/tān…bāhlīkān) 8. 30. 11; pañca nadyo vahanty etā yatra niḥsṛtya parvatāt/āraṭṭā nāma bāhlīkāḥ) 8. 30. 43; one had to cross the rivers Śatadruka and Irāvatī to reach Bāhlīka from Kuru country (śatadrukanadīṁ tīrtvā tāṁ ca ramyām irāvatīm/gatvā svadeśam) 8. 30. 19, 21.

Nārāyaṇa (Kṛṣṇa) and the Kṛta Yuga: Bhagavān Nārāyaṇa (who was the same as KṛṣṇaJanārdana 3. 187. 52, 50) told Mārkaṇḍeya that his colour in the Kṛta Yuga was white (śvetaḥ kṛtayuge varṇaḥ) 3. 187. 31; Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that Kṛṣṇa was complete Dharma in the Kṛta Yuga (kṛte yuge dharma āsīt samagraḥ) 13. 143. 9. 

  G.   King and the Kṛta Yuga: The king is the creator of the Kṛta Yuga (rājā kṛtayugasraṣṭā) 5. 130. 16 = 12. 70. 25, (also cf. rājā kālasya kāraṇam 12. 70. 6); Kṛta and the remaining three Yugas depend on the conduct of the king and hence the king is identical with Yuga (rājavṛttāni sarvāṇi rājaiva yugam ucyate) 12. 92. 6; (rājamūlāni sarvāṇi) 12. 139. 10; when the king fully followed daṇḍanīti then prevalied the Kṛta Yuga, the best of time (daṇḍanītyāṁ yadā rājā samyak kārtsnyena vartate/tadā kṛtayugaṁ nāma kālaḥ śreṣṭhaḥ pravartate//) 5. 130. 14 = 12. 70. 7; Dyumatsena told Satyavān that in the Kṛta Yuga the king followed the instruction (how a king should rule 12. 259. 24-30) as his primary principle (etat prathamakalpena rājā kṛtayuge 'bhajat) 12. 259. 32; a king, as the creator of Kṛta, enjoyed in the heaven endlessly (kṛtasya karaṇād rājā svargam atyantam aśnute) 5. 130. 17 = 12. 70. 26; king Yayāti was described by Aṣṭaka as the best among those born in the Kṛta Yuga (kārtayugapradhāna) 1. 85. 1 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 90. 1: kārtayugapradhāna/kṛtayuge bhavāḥ kārtayugāḥ/atyantaniṣpāpā teṣāṁ mukhyatamety arthaḥ). 

  H.   Kṛta and dharma: In the Kṛta Yuga the ancient dharma prevails (yatra dharmaḥ sanātanaḥ) 3. 148. 10; in that Yuga the eternal dharma of the four varṇas stands on all its four feet (i. e. is in no way deficient) (kṛte yuge catuṣpādaś cāturvarṇyasya śāśvataḥ) 3. 148. 21; formerly in the Kṛta Yuga Dharma, the bull, without deceit and free from vices stood established in its entirety among men (kṛte catuṣpāt sakalo nirvyājopādhivarjitaḥ/vṛṣaḥ pratiṣṭhito dharmo manuṣyeṣv abhavat purā//) 3. 188. 10 (Nī. on 3. 190. 9: vṛṣa iva catuṣpāt); 12. 327. 73; both dharma, on its four feet, and truth are fully established in the Kṛta Yuga (catuṣpāt sakalo dharmaḥ satyaṁ caiva kṛte yuge) 12. 224. 22; since dharma is not contaminated by adharma (nādharmeṇāgamaḥ kaścit 12. 224. 22) it does not get diminished (dharmo na hrasate kvacit) 1. 58. 22; dharma always prospers and adharma is destroyed 3. 189. 7; 12. 70. 8; dharma in the Kṛta Yuga was established among the Brāhmaṇas who had mastered their self, who had practised austerities and who had studied the Vedas (ātmavatsu tapovatsu śrutavaisu pratiṣṭhitaḥ) 12. 224. 67; dharma in different Yugas is different 12. 224. 26 = 12. 252. 8; austerity is the best dharma for the Kṛta (tapaḥ paraṁ kṛtayuge) 12. 24. 27; in the Kṛta Yuga the only dharma is renunciation (dharmaḥ saṁnyāsa eva ca) 3. 148. 13; one is not supposed to get angry in the Kṛta Yuga (na roṣaṁ kartum arhasi/naiṣa dharmaḥ kṛtayuge yas tvaṁ roṣam acīkṛthāḥ) 12. 323. 17. 

  I.   Kṛta and the sacrifice: In the Kṛta Yuga performance of sacrifices is not prescribed (tretāyuge vidhis tv eṣāṁ yajñānāṁ na kṛte yuge) 12. 224. 62; the sages who assembled for a sacrifice told gods who wanted a goat to be killed that that was not the dharma of good people; they reminded the gods that they were in the Kṛta Yuga when an animal was not offered (naiṣa dharmaḥ satāṁ devā yatra vadhyeta vai paśuḥ/idaṁ kṛtayugaṁ śreṣṭhaṁ kathaṁ vadhyeta vai paśuḥ//) 12. 324. 5; (ahiṁsyā yajñapaśavo yuge 'smin naitad anyathā) 12. 327. 73; the offerings offered by Brahman and others to Viṣṇu in a Vaiṣṇava Kratu were offered according to the prescriptions meant for the Kṛta Yuga and, as a result, they reached the Puruṣa who had the brightness of the sun and who was above darkness (te kārtayugadharmāṇo bhāgā paramasatkṛtāḥ/ prāpur ādityavarṇaṁ taṁ puruṣaṁ tamasaḥ param//) 12. 327. 50 (commentator Vidyāsāgara: kārtayugadharmāṇaḥ ahiṁsādilakṣaṇakṛtasvabhāvāḥ mantralopatantralopakriyālopahiṁsādirahitāḥ paramasaṁskṛtāḥ, cf. the note on this stanza in the Cr. Ed.); but according to Bhīṣma when the king, in any other Yuga, employed daṇḍanītī properly, condition was as good as in the Kṛta Yuga (12. 70. 7); in such a Kṛta Yuga, all the three Varṇas offered Soma sacrifices according to rites (some prayatnaṁ kurvanti trayo varṇā yathāvidhi) (Editor's note on the stanza: some = devatādīn uddiśya somayāge) and the Vedic rites were faultlessly performed (vaidikāni ca karmāṇi bhavanty aviguṇāny uta) 12. 70. 9. 

  J.   Nature of the Kṛta Yuga, its effects on men: Hanūmant told Bhīma that the times in the Kṛta Yuga were different from those in the other Yugas (anyaḥ kṛtayuge kālas tretāyāṁ dvāpare paraḥ) 3. 148. 6; Kṛta Yuga described by different persons: (1) by Hanūmant to Bhīma 3. 148. 11-22 (Kṛta Yuga was completely free from the three qualities (viz. sattva, rajas and tamas) (traiguṇyaparivarjitam 3. 148. 22); (2) by Vaiśaṁpāyana to Janamejaya 1. 58. 8-24 (kāle gāvaḥ prasūyante nāryaś ca bharatarṣabha/ phalanty ṛtuṣu vṛkṣāś ca puṣpāṇi ca phalāni ca// 1. 58. 23); (3) by Mārkaṇḍeya to the Pāṇḍavas 3. 189. 8-13 (ṣaṭkarmaniratā viprāḥ kṣatriyā rakṣaṇe ratāḥ// śusrūṣāyāṁ ratāḥ śūdrās tathā varṇatrayasya ca/eṣa dharmaḥ kṛtayuge…// 3. 189. 12-13); (4) by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira (when a king in any Yuga practised daṇḍanīti properly) 12. 70. 8-13 (the qualities of Kṛta age are called kārtayugān guṇgān 12. 70. 13, also kārtayugadharmāṇo bhāgāḥ 12. 327. 50); (5) by Saṁjaya to Dhṛtarāṣṭra 6. 11. 8-9; in general the people of the Kṛta Yuga were possessed of fortitude, were diligent in their duties, knew the proper time for the use of valour (dhṛtimantaś ca dakṣāś ca sve sve karmaṇi bhārata/parākramavidhānajñā narāḥ kṛtayuge 'bhavan) 3. 159. 2; the ascetics of the Kṛta Yuga were calm and they remained steady in the sattva quality (tapasvinaḥ praśāntāś ca sattvasthāś ca kṛte yuge) 12. 230. 7 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 238. 7: praśāntāḥ niḥsaṁśayāḥ); all the ascetics then made no distinction between pauruṣa, daiva and svabhāva as the cause of the success in karma and had neither love nor hatred for the ṛcs, the yajuses and the sāmans; hence they practised austerities (and did not perform sacrifices) apṛthagdarśinaḥ sarve ṛksāmasu yajuḥṣu ca/kāmadveṣau pṛthag dṛṣṭvā tapaḥ kṛta upāsate//) 12. 230. 8 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 238. 8: vedatraye 'pi bhedam apaśyantaḥ kāmyādīn pṛthakkṛtya tapo jñānam upāsate śrayanti); 12. 224. 63 (Kṛta not mentioned, but Nī., on Bom. Ed. 12. 232. 33 supplies it: advaitaniṣṭhā martyās tapa eva yogam eva kṛtayuge 'nutiṣṭhantīti śeṣaḥ); when Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and Vidura were born the country of the Kurus (kurujāṅgalam), the Kurus themselves and the Kurukṣetra, all prospered 1. 102. 1; at that time a condition similar to the Kṛta Yuga prevailed in the regions of the different kingdoms (pradeśeṣv api rāṣṭrāṇāṁ kṛtam yugam avartata) 1. 102. 5; this condition is described in 1. 102. 2-11; people in the Kṛta Yuga did not have to cohabit to beget children, they could have them by mere thought (na caiṣāṁ maithuno dharmo babhūva bharatarṣabha/ saṁkalpād eva caiteṣām apatyam udapadyata//) 12. 200. 35; in the Kṛta Yuga evil tribes like the Talavaras, the Andhrakas etc. in the south and the Yaunas (Yavanas), Kāmbojas etc. in the north did not exist on the earth 12. 200. 39-43; there were no bhikṣus and those who have sectarian marks (liṅginaḥ); similarly there were no alternatives to the four āśramas; all this happened when the Kṛta Yuga passed away and the daṇḍanīti was no longer practised--thus Indra told to Māndhātṛ 12. 65. 24-25. 

  K.   Expectation of life: In the Kṛta Yuga people were free from diseases, succeeded in achieving all objectives and lived for four hundred years (arogāḥ sarvasiddhārthāś caturvarṣaśatāyuṣaḥ/kṛte) 12. 224. 24; however, according to Saṁjaya people lived for four thousand years (catvāri ca sahasrāṇi varṣāṇāṁ kurusattama/āyuḥsaṁkhyā kṛtayuge saṁkhyātā rājasattama//) 6. 11. 5 (apparently there is confusion between the duration of the Kṛta Yuga (above section 

  C.  ) and lifeexpectancy of human beings); also cf. sahasraśatajīvinaḥ tāḥ prajāḥ…//…evaṁ kṛtayuge samyag vartamāne tadā nṛpa) 1. 58. 10, 24; men lived as long as they liked and they had no fear of Yama 12. 200. 34; (na kṣīyante ca vai prajāḥ) 3. 148. 11; (nālpāyur dṛśyate naraḥ) 12. 70. 11; but the life expectation, virility etc. decrease successively in the Yugas that follow the Kṛta (āyur vīryam atho buddhir…manuṣyāṇām anuyugaṁ hrasatīti nibodha me) 3. 188. 13. 

  L.   Kṛta as the name of Sūrya: Kṛta appears among the 108 names of Sūrya taught by Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22. 

  M.   Etymology: The etymology is implied when it is said that in the Kṛta Yuga (whatever needs be done) is done and does not remain undone (kṛtam eva na kartavyaṁ tasmin kāle yugottame) 3. 148. 10 [Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 149. 11: kṛtam eva sarve kṛtakṛtyā evety arthaḥ/tata eva hetoḥ kṛtayugaṁ nāma//). [Nī., Bom. Ed. 3. 191. 3, who reads vipraiś corakṣayaś caiva kṛte kṣemaṁ bhaviṣyati in place of the Cr. Ed. vipraiś corakṣaye caiva kṛte (3. 189. 3) interprets kṛte yuge; the words kṛta, tretā etc. occurring in 5. 140. 7-15 (= Bom. Ed. 5. 142. 7-15) are interpreted by Nī. as the Yuga names and not as names of the throws of dice in a dice game].

*2nd word in left half of page p245  (+offset) in original book.Kaurava, Kauraveya, Kauravya  : (pl.): Name of a people; like the word Kuru, these words also have various significances (the choice of the word depending on metrical requirements). 

  A.   People of the Kuru country: Duryodhana, the king of the Kauravas (kauravāṇām adhipaḥ) 6. 55. 106; Yudhiṣṭhira, the king of the Kauravas (sa rājā …kauravāṇām) 5. 32. 9; he was the protector and the ruler of Kaurava people 5. 147. 31; Karṇa, while praising the people of certain countries as opposed to the Bāhlīkas, said that Kauraveyas were the religion incarnate (i. e. they practised dharma scrupulously) (kauraveyāḥ svadharmaḥ) 8. 30. 73 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 8. 45. 28 reads kauraveyās tu dharmyam which he explains as dharmyaṁ dharmād anapetaṁ karma mānayantīti śeṣaḥ).

*2nd word in left half of page p347  (+offset) in original book.Gāṇḍīva, Gāṇḍiva  : nt.: Name of Arjuna's bow (Gāṇḍiva recognized by Kāśikā on P. 5. 2. 110, but very likely it occurs m. c.). 

  A.   Etymology: So called because it was made of gāṇḍī, i. e. the bow was covered with the skin of rhinoceros (?), or because it was made of the backbone of rhinoceros (?) (eṣa gāṇḍīmayaś cāpaḥ…yatas tad gāṇḍivaṁ dhanuḥ 5. 96. 19; cf. gāṇḍī khaḍgākhyaḥ paśuviśeṣaḥ/tasya vikāro gāṇḍīmayaḥ/tasya hi paśūnāṁ vā pṛṣṭhavaṁśasya dhanuḥ kartuṁ śakyam yataḥ gāṇḍīmayatvād eva tad gāṇḍīvaṁ nāma dhanur abhūt/…gāṇḍī vajragranthis tanmaya ity anye (= Sarvajñanārāyaṇa) Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 98. 19). 

  B.   Origin: It was created by Brahman in very old times (purā) 1. 216. 17; 8. 50. 56; Indra fastened an undecaying (ajarā) string on it when Arjuna got ready to fight the Nivātakavacas 3. 165. 14; (however, Aśvatthāman cut it off and Arjuna had to put a new string on it 4. 54. 8). 

  C.   History: After its creation, Brahman first held it for 1000 years, and then it was held successively by Prajāpati for 800 years (?) or 503 years (?) (trīṇi pañcaśataṁ caiva), by Śakra for 85 years, by Soma for 500 years, by Varuṇa for 100 years, and, up to the beginning of the ajñātavāsa, it was with Arjuna for 65 years 4. 38. 39-41; it lay in the Varuṇaloka, perhaps in Varuṇa's lake, and was guarded there by the gods 5. 96. 19; hence the how was considered as properly belonging to Varuṇa (vāruṇaṁ gāṇḍivam) 5. 155. 5; (5. 59. 12); at the time of burning the Khāṇḍava forest, Agni asked Varuṇa to give Gāṇḍīva, which he had received from Soma, to Arjuna since he was to perform great feats with it; Varuṇa agreed to Agni's request 1. 216. 3-4; (17. 1. 39); when Arjuna received it, he bowed to Agni, held the bow firmly, and strung it; at that time there was a loud noise 1. 216. 17-20; 1. 55. 37; 3. 157. 20; 5. 155. 7; according to another version Arjuna received the bow, not before, but after he satisfied god Fire 2. 44. 5; 8. 57. 41; Śaṅkara told Arjuna that the Ganḍīva he now held was the same which her as Nara, had used to chastise the Daityas at the time of Indra's abhiṣeka 3. 41. 3-4. 

  D.   Association of Gāṇḍīva with Arjuna 1. 1. 123; 5. 136. 5; it was considered very suitable for Arjuna 2. 3. 6; 3. 41. 4; 8. 31. 55; hence Arjuna has epithets like gāṇḍīvadhanvan 2. 54. 22; 3 34. 6; 3. 46. 8; 3. 49. 26; 3. 155. 6; 3. 159. 22; 3. 225. 20; 3. 252. 18; 3. 299. 22; 4. 2. 16; 4. 40. 7; 4. 48. 3 (ºdhanvin); 4. 49. 16; 4. 53. 63; 4. 61. 8; 5. 3. 16; 5. 5. 10; 5. 22. 10, 12, 13; 5. 47. 6; 5. 51. 2, 3; 5. 56. 60; 5. 63. 5; 5. 88. 69; 5. 139. 41; 5. 153. 25; 5. 154. 20; 5. 164. 4, 36; 6. 19. 34; 6. 46. 44; 6. 48. 22; 6. 55. 126; 6. 67. 3; 6. 69. 3, 8, 10; 6. 100. 13; 6. 114. 54, 61; 7. 9. 20; 7. 15. 47; 7. 16. 12; 7. 33. 5; 7. 47. 23; 7. 52. 10; 7. 55. 15; 7. 56. 8; 7. 61. 48; 7. 64. 11; 7. 67. 64; 7. 80. 9; 7. 98. 12; 7. 121. 10; 7. 134. 55; 7. 157. 36; 7. 158. 43; 7. 160. 24; 8. 5. 16; 8. 46. 1; 8. 49. 107; 8. 50. 48, 49; 8. 63. 67; 8. 66. 22; 8. 69. 14, 33; 9. 3. 38; 9. 15. 45; 9. 61. 8, 11, 12, 14, 21, 23; 10 5. 18, 19; 10. 12. 25; 10. 14. 7; 10. 16. 2; 11. 20. 4, 15; 11. 21. 3; 11. 23. 19; 12. 2. 7; 12. 5. 14; 12. 40. 20; 12. 53 25; 14. 59. 11; 14. 77. 13; 14. 80. 15; gāṇḍīvabhṛt 5. 23. 26; 14. 77. 1, 6; 1. 83. 11; gāṇḍīvadhārin 5. 169. 12; 6. 41 1; gāṇḍīvin 5. 141. 34; gāṇḍīvabāṇahasta 6. 22. 10.

  F.   Big sound: Famous for the big sound it produced, i. e. the sound produced by the string while striking against the forearm of Arjuna (jyāghoṣa 3. 40. 9; jyānināda 7. 65. 14; jyātalanirghoṣa 6. 116. 20; maurvyās talaniṣpeṣam 5. 47. 47; jyayā samāhatya tale bhṛśaṁ ca 8. 60. 12), which filled all directions, reached the sky, shook the earth, and, being unbearable, caused fear in the minds of hearers, especially the opponents; the sound often referred to as nirghoṣa or ghoṣa 2. 72. 32; 4. 41. 14, 18; 4. 57. 10; 4. 61. 9, 27; 5. 47. 58; 5. 140. 7; 6. 45. 16; 6. 67. 2, 11; 6. 74. 30; 6. 116. 20; 7. 3. 14, 15, 19; 7. 9. 23; 7. 29. 31, 32; 7. 65. 15 (elephants frightened); 7. 85. 37; 7. 102. 6; 7. 114. 91; 8. 27. 48; 8. 37. 1; 8. 59. 15; 8. 60. 12; 9. 3. 19, 33; 9. 27. 61; or as mahāsvana, nisvana or svana 4. 40. 25; 4. 41. 15; 4. 48. 2; 5. 136. 26; 6. 55. 114; 6. 56. 26 (nirhrādamahāsvana); 6. 108. 14; 7. 145. 44, 45; 8. 58. 13 (bhairavasvana); 8. 67. 19; or as praṇāda, ninada 6. 55. 116; 7. 65. 14; 7. 145. 46; or as nirhāda 6. 56. 26; 14. 72. 15 (bhīmanirhāda); or as śabda 4. 40. 27; 4. 41. 16; 5. 26. 24; 5. 47. 47; 6. 55. 113, 115; 7. 9. 19; 7. 51. 40; 7. 95. 9; or by the verb ras- 7. 3. 19; sound compared with the roar of a thunder (visphūrjitam ivāśaneḥ) 3. 48. 9; 4. 48. 5; 4. 57. 10; 5. 140. 7; 6. 116. 20; 7. 3. 15; 8. 26. 29; 3. 252. 17, 5. 23. 20 (stanayitnughoṣa); 6. 55. 105 (stanayitnukalpa); 5. 47. 47 (vajraniṣpeṣatulya); or with the roar of a cloud (prāvṛḍjaladanisvana) 7. 9. 23; 3. 41. 3; hearing (or non-hearing) the sound meant different things on different occasions: (1) hearing it Droṇa knew Arjuna was proceeding towards Bhīṣma 6. 108. 14; (2) Karṇa inferred that Arjuna must have killed the Śibis and the Pauravas 7. 145. 4546; (3) Sātyaki concluded that Arjuna must be nearby 7. 95. 9; (4) it became a rallying point to Virāṭa, Drupada and other kings 6. 55. 115; (5) when not heard, Yudhiṣṭhira became anxious about Arjuna's safety 7. 85. 37; 7. 102. 6; (6) Arjuna made the twang of his bow (gāṇḍīvaṁ prākṣipat pāṛthaḥ) to express joy at the defeat of Karṇa by Bhīma 7. 104. 31. 

  G.   Use by Arjuna: 1. Besides Arjuna, the bow (Gāṇḍiva) could be strung only by Bhīma and Kṛṣṇa 3. 13. 69; but it was, in fact, used only by Arjuna, hence blame could attach to Gāṇḍiva of Arjuna if it was not used against Duryodhana 3. 13. 70; 4. 20. 1; Arjuna's association with Gāṇḍīva and dependence of Pāṇḍavas' victory on it often stressed 1. 216 29; 2. 66. 12; 3. 6. 9; 4. 5. 17; 4. 38. 37; 5. 124. 2; 8. 69. 24; Arjuna owed a debt to his bow from which he would be free by killing Karṇa 8. 52. 23; Arjuna could wield the bow with both hands equally dexterously (ubhau me dakṣiṇau pāṇī gāṇḍīvasya vikarṣaṇe), hence he was called Savyasācin 4. 39. 17; 4. 56. 4; 4. 59. 12; 7. 51. 40; Arjuna cleaned the bow-string and the bow before use 8. 52. 2 (jyām anumṛjya); 7. 18. 9 (gāṇḍīvam upasamṛjya); left unstrung when it was not to be used for a long time (apajyam akarot) 4. 5. 17; when not held in hand (and left unstrung) Gāṇḍīva gaped (anālabdhaṁ jṛmbhati gāṇḍivaṁ dhanuḥ) 5. 47. 96; before putting an arrow to the bow, Arjuna just touched it (i. e. touched the bow-string) 8. 57. 15 (saṁspṛśan gāṇḍivaṁ dhanuḥ), or stretched it with force (balavat 7. 78. 36) (vy-ā-kṣip-, vi-kṣip-, prā-kṣip-) so that it produced big sound 4. 40. 24-27; 6. 114. 43; 6. 116. 19; 7. 51. 40; 7. 80. 35; 7. 104. 31; 8. 32. 7; 8. 52. 2; 9. 13. 26; 9. 17. 6; 9. 18. 64; 14. 72. 8; 14. 74. 4; (vi-sphāraya-) 7. 78. 36; 8. 21. 15; (ā-yam-) 7. 80. 31; while shooting arrows, Arjuna shook it (dodhūyamāna, (vi)dhūyamāna, (vi)dhunvan) 4. 48. 2; 5. 23. 20; 5. 47. 47; 6. 65. 9; 7. 53. 20; 7. 64. 18; 9. 3. 21; when moved in a circle it looked like a firebrand (alāta) 9. 3. 20; (agnicakra) 4. 59. 12; or like a lightning (vidyut) 9. 3. 21, and Arjuna looked like the sun at the end of the aeon (yugānta) 8. 57. 55; it as if flew in all directions like a lightning 4. 58. 11; Arjuna recited mantras on Gāṇḍīva, (the bow-string, and the arrows) on special occasions: (1) while releasing the vajra-like arrows by employing the vajra missible of Indra against the Nivātakavacas (anumantrya ca gāṇḍīvam) 3. 169. 1314; (2) while shooting three arrows to produce a pillow for Bhīṣma (āmantrya gāṇḍīvam) 6. 115. 41, and (3) to procure water from the earth for Bhīṣma (śaraṁ dīptam abhimantrya) 6. 116. 19-23; (4) while using Aindrāstra to combat the Brahmāstra of Karṇa (gāṇḍīvaṁ jyāṁ ca bāṇāṁś ca anumantrya dhanaṁjayaḥ/ asṛjac charavarṣāṇi) 8. 66. 49; Arjuna called mantravid when be made a sort of satyakriyā (anena satyena nihantv ayaṁ śaraḥ) while shooting the arrow that killed Karṇa 8. 67. 19-20; 2. After receiving Gāṇḍīva from Varuṇa Arjuna must have used it on all occasions; specific mention of arrows or missiles released (or to be released) from Gāṇḍīva (which went straight to the target) is found at 3. 34. 83; 3. 172. 5; 3. 252. 18; 4. 45. 23-24; 4. 52. 8; 4. 55. 21; 4. 60. 13; 5. 23. 20; 5. 47. 48, (55, 58); 7. 65. 16; 7. 68. 5, 33; 7. 120. 85; 7. 145. 50; 8. 12. 38; 8. 21. 15-17; 8. 42. 46; 8. 46. 42; 8. 51. 83; 8. 52. 8; 8. 52. 13-14; 8. 58. 13; 9. 23. 57; 9. 24. 1; 14. 74. 14; 14. 83. 30; 14. 85. 5, 15; 16. 9. 21; no one realized the time that elapsed between Arjuna's drawing out the arrow from the quiver, his putting it to the bow, and discharging it from Gāṇḍīva 4. 57. 19; hence the arrows sped like mind or wind (manonilasamā jave) 7. 53. 42; (ativegavantaḥ) 3. 252. 17; (śīghravegān) 3. 252. 18; they appeared to follow each other in close succession (saṁsaktā yānti sāyakāḥ) 5. 164. 4; they appeared like the rows of bees (and this was highly thought of by Mātali) 3. 167. 22, or like a swarm of moths (3. 252. 18); or like the rows of swans in the sky 7. 121. 3; the arrows released from Gāṇḍīva had the impact of the thunderbolt of Indra (indrāśanisamasparśāḥ) 9. 23. 55; 9. 24. 2; 3. 169. 15 (vajracoditā bāṇāḥ); or they shone like a lightning (vajrāśanisamaprabhān) 14. 78. 27; (aśaniprākāśaiḥ) 4. 49. 22; the arrows released from Gāṇḍīva were burning and produced fire 5. 56. 27; 5. 141. 42; 8. 52. 32; 4. 45. 23; 8. 46. 42; [also see the following section];  3.  Specific mention of the bow: Arjuna must have used Gāṇḍīva on all occassions (5. 53. 1) starting from its use when Arjuna helped god Fire to burn the Khāṇḍava forest (1. 217-219); the bow is specifically mentioned by name when Arjuna got ready to fight with Kirmīra 3. 12. 40; started off to meat Indra to acquire heavenly weapons 3. 38. 15; lifted it to shoot at the boar (Daitya Mūka) 3. 40. 9; fought with Kirāta (Śaṅkara) 3. 40. 29; in this fight the bow (not named) was swallowed by Śaṅkara 3. 40. 39-40, and then returned to Arjuna 3. 41. 4, 25; used while fighting with the Nivātakavacas 3. 167. 6, 22; 3. 168. 23; 3. 169. 2; with Kālakeyas 3. 170. 40, 50; (at the time of cattle-raid) while fighting with Karṇa 4. 49. 22; with Kṛpa 4. 52. 3, 8; with Droṇa 4. 53. 28, 58; at the start of the epic war Arjuna raised his bow (Gāṇḍīva not named) while asking Kṛṣṇa to station his chariot between the two armies 6. 23. 20; out of dejection Gāṇḍīva slipped down from Arjuna's hand 6. 23. 30; but afterwards he used it successfully in the war 6. 41. 1; he used it to attack Bhīṣma 6. 43. 9; 6. 81. 10; to fight with Sudakṣiṇa (a Kāmboja prince) 7. 67. 61; its use against Jayadratha hinted 3. 252. 17, 18; while forcing his way towards Jayadratha 1. 1. 137; Arjuna, with Gāṇḍīva in hand, stood guard on the ground when, while marching towards Jayadratha, Kṛṣṇa refreshed the horses 7. 74. 41; while aiming the arrow at Jayadratha 7. 89. 17; to cut off Jayadratha's head 7. 121. 3; while fighting with Karṇa 7. 114. 82, 83, 87; 8. 68. 37; Arjuna bent his bow (dhanur vināmya) while boasting about himself 8. 49. 92; he used it to fight with Aśvatthāman 9. 13. 26; to protect Yudhiṣṭhira 9. 17. 6; to foil the attempt of Śakuni's warriors to kill Sahadeva 9. 28. 3, 30; while fighting with Vajradatta (son of Bhagadatta of Prāgjyotiṣa) 14. 74. 4, 5, 14; and when Vajradatta's elephant attacked Arjuna 14. 75. 10; at the end of the epic war when the Pāṇḍavas reached the camp of Duryodhana Kṛṣṇa asked Arjuna to unstring the Gāṇḍīva 9. 61. 9; he used it while fighting with Babhruvāhana 14. 78. 27; with Meghasandhi (son of Jarāsandha) 14. 83. 11, 15; with the Mleccha armies of the Vaṅga, the Puṇḍra, and the Kerala countries 14. 83. 29-30; to fight with the Dasyus 16. 8. 52, 58. 

  H.   Arjuna's vow regarding Gāṇḍīva: It was Arjuna's secret vow (upāṁśuvrata, vrata) to kill a person who asked him to give away his Gāṇḍīva to some one else 8. 49. 9, 61-62; (pratijñā) 8. 49. 11, 63; but the vow was apparently known to Kṛṣṇa (8. 49. 61) and to Yudhiṣṭhira 8. 49. 107-109 (pratijñā); Yudhiṣṭhira, in a fit of anger, asked Arjuna to give away Gāṇḍīva to Kṛṣṇa and act as his charioteer, and hence Yudhiṣṭhira's life was in danger 8. 48. 14; 8. 49. 1. 

  I.   Comparisons: 1 (i) Arjuna with the stretched Gāṇḍīva forming a full circle appeared like the sun with a halo arround it (yathaiva sūryaḥ pariveṣagas tathā) 8. 57. 57; (ii) when Arjuna released arrows using both hands, Gāṇḍīva looked like a swinging wheel of fire (agnicakram ivābaddham) 4. 59. 12; (iii) in the sacrifice to be performed with weapons (śastrayajña), Gānḍīva would serve as a sacrificial ladle (sruc) 5. 139. 30; 2. Standard of comparison: (i) The lustre of Rukmin's bow (Vijaya), obtained from Mahendra, compared with that of Gāṇḍīva 5. 155. 4; (ii) the sound (ghoṣa) of Abhimanyu's bow compared with that of Gāṇḍīva 6. 45. 16 

  J.   Defeat: 1. Occasional: (i) When Arjuna's arrows had no effect on the armour of Duryodhana, Kṛṣṇa asked Arjuna whether his Gāṇḍīva had lost its former force (prāṇāḥ) 7. 78. 7; (ii) Jayadratha on one occasion succeeded in piercing the Gāṇḍīva with three arrows 7. 121. 12; (iii) as long as Karṇa had his armour, ear-rings, and the śakti, Arjuna, even with his Gāṇḍīva, could not defeat Karṇa 7. 155. 17; 7. 155. 13-15; (iv) when Aśvatthaman excelled Arjuna, Krṣṇa in surprise asked him whether he still held the Gāṇḍīva in his hand 8. 40. 124; (v) Gāṇḍīva dropped down from the hand of Arjuna when Dhṛtavarman of the Trigartas hit Arjuna on his hand with a sharp arrow 14. 73. 22-24 (picked up by Arjuna 14. 75. 24); (vi) when the Sindhu kings attacked Arjuna and he swooned, Gāṇḍīva slipped from his hand 14. 76. 21, (which he picked up again 14. 76. 26); (vii) According to Ulūka, Gāṇḍīva of no help to Arjuna at the game of dice 5. 158. 28-29; 2. Final: When Arjuna was taking with him the Vṛṣṇi women to Hāstinapura, he was attacked on way by the Dasyus; at that time Arjuna could string the Gāṇḍīva with great effort (yatnād iva kathaṁcana; kṛcchreṇa) 16. 8. 52-53; his arrows were exhausted so that Arjuna had to strike the Dasyus with the tip of the bow (dhanuṣkoṭyā) 16. 8. 58-60, 63 (dhanuṣaś cāvidheyatvāt); 16. 9. 17-18; this was the defeat of Gāṇḍīva (gāṇḍīvasya parābhavam) 1. 2. 226. 

  K.   Returned to Varuṇa: When the Pāṇḍavas started for the forest, Arjuna would not leave his bow and quivers behind; Agni, who had burnt the Khāṇḍava, asked Arjuna to abandon the bow as it had no further purpose to serve; Agni got it from Varuṇa for Arjuna, hence Arjuna should return it to Varuṇa; at the instance of his brothers, Arjuna dropped the bow and the quivers into the water 17. 1. 32, 36-37, 39-40.

*2nd word in left half of page p362  (+offset) in original book.Dasyu  : m. (pl.): Designation of a class of people following a mode of life not approved by the law-makers; sometimes (especially in the Śāntiparvan) the term designates robbers; they moved in groups, hence sometimes referred to as dasyugaṇa. 

  A.   Location: Lived in the north-east (prāguttarāṁ diśaṁ ye ca vasanty āśritya dasyavaḥ) 2. 24. 23; lived on mountains (dasyūn parvatavāsinaḥ) 2. 24. 15; lived in forests (apy araṇyaṁ samāśritya cared dasyugaṇaiḥ saha) 12. 131. 10. 

  B.   Description: Their heads shaven (lūnamūrdhaja) 7. 95. 40; sinful (pāpakarman), their minds obsessed by avarice (lobhopahatacetas), and their sight inauspicious (aśubhadarśana) 16. 8. 45; cruel (krūra) 8. 49. 43; used sticks as weapons (yaṣṭipraharaṇa) 16. 8. 47. 

  C.   Relations with other tribes: Ocassionally referred to as Śabara (tatrāvasat…śabarālaye) 12. 162. 34; (vāso me śabarālaye) 12. 162. 5; Yavanas, Kirātas, Gāndhāras, and many other tribes led the life of Dasyus (sarve te dasyujīvinaḥ) 12. 65. 13-15. 

  D.   Their degraded status in society revealed in many ways: (1) By comparing men who behaved improperly or unlawfully with Dasyus: (i) A poor man's begging is like an attack; he thereby annoys others like a Dasyu (yāñcām āhur anīśasya abhihāraṁ ca bhārata/udvejayati yācan hi sadā bhūtāni dasyuvat//) 13. 59. 4 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 60. 4: anīśasya daridrasya/ but abhihāraṁ tiraskāram); (ii) A man of evil conduct considered mean like a Dasyu (durācāras tu durbuddhir…dasyur ivādhamaḥ) 12. 166. 9; (iii) Ignorant men carry on their heads the burden of saṁsāra by considering the wrong direction (as the right one) just as the Dasyus carry on their heads the load of flesh while following the wrong way (prakīrṇameṣabhāro hi yadvat dhāryeta dasyubhiḥ/ pratilomāṁ diśaṁ buddhvā saṁsāram abudhās tathā//) 12. 208. 13 (Nī. Bom. Ed. 12. 215. 14 reads prakīrṇameṣabhāraṁ hi and explains: āmiṣabhāraṁ vahantaś corāḥ gamyāṁ diśaṁ rājakīyādyavarodhāt pratikūlāṁ budhvā (?) āmiṣaṁ tyaktvānyāṁ diśam gacchanto yathā na badhyante… prakīrṇameṣaḥ viśastameṣaḥ āmiṣam ity arthaḥ klībatvam ārṣam see Editors note on Vol. 16. p. 2169 where Arjunamiśra's reading moṣa, meaning loptra ‘stolen property’, in place of meṣa is preferred); but just as one should abandon the company of the Dasyus going the wrong way and follow the wholesome way, similarly one should give up doing actions dominated by rajas and tamas and gain happiness (tān eva ca yathā dasyūn kṣiptvā gacchec chivāṁ diśam/tathā rajastamaḥkarmāṇy utsṛjya prāpnuyāt sukham) 12. 208. 14; (iv) According to Maitreya what happened in the sabhā of the Kauravas was like imitating the behaviour of Dasyus (dasyūnām iva yad vṛttaṁ sabhāyām) 3. 11. 17; (v) Draupadī told Virāṭa that his following the dharma of Dasyus (since he did nothing to check Kīcaka) brought no credit to his Sabhā (dasyūnām iva dharmas te na hi saṁsadi śobhate) 4. 15. 24; (vi) Sātyaki's killing Bhūriśravas in the unlawful way was choosing the dharma of Dasyus 7. 131. 2; (2) By referring to the unlawful and dangerous acts of Dasyus: (i) Yavanas, Kirātas and others, though they lived in towns, followed the way of Dasyus (sarve te dasyujīvinaḥ) 12. 65. 15; (ii) Māndhātṛ told Indra that there were Dasyus living in disguise among all Varṇas and all the Āśramas (dṛśyante mānavā loke sarvavarṇeṣu dasyavaḥ/ liṅgāntare vartamānā āśrameṣu caturṣv api//) 12. 65. 23; (iii) Yudhiṣṭhira asked Bhīṣma how should a Brāhmaṇa, who did not want to give up his sons and grandsons, live when the dharma was at its lowest ebb, when all means of subsistence were under the control of Dasyus (sarvasmin dasyusādbhūte pṛthivyām upajīvane) 12. 130. 1 (dasyu is equated with asādhu in 12. 130. 2-3); 12. 138. 1; 12. 139. 6; (iv) Dasyus have been killing men since old times thinking ‘they have wealth’; they torture men inflicting on them various punishments and always distress them (dhanam asyeti puruṣaṁ purā nighnanti dasyavaḥ) 12. 171. 36; (v) As good men do not take what belongs to others, so do Dasyus not practise non-violence; people are pleased with Dasyus if they observe restraint (yathā sadbhiḥ parādānam ahiṁsā dasyubhis tathā/ anurajyanti bhūtāni samaryādeṣu dasyuṣu// 12. 131. 14 (Nī., however, who reads dasyubhiḥ kṛtā on 12. 133. 15: sadbhir dasyubhiḥ parādānaṁ parasvaharaṇam api kṛtam ahiṁsā bhavati tathā vakṣye iti śeṣaḥ); (vi) Killing some one when he is not fighting, violation of wives of others, ungratefulness, robbing a Brāhmaṇa of his wealth, leaving him without any possessions (niḥśeṣakaraṇaṁ tathā), robbing women, coersion (paristhānam cf. Critical Notes Vol. 14. p. 932), all this is practised by Dasyus and is censurable; and even if a Dasyu does not practise such acts, he is all the same a Dasyu (dasyuṣv etad vigarhitam//sa eṣa eva bhavati dasyuṛ etāni varjayan) 12. 131. 15-16 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 133. 16: niḥśeṣakaraṇam sarvaharaṇam); (vii) Death at the hands of a Dasyu is considered wretched (prākṛto vadha ucyate) and is equated with death due to poison, hanging, or burns, or due to getting killed by animals having jaws 12. 286. 25 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 297. 25 seems to explain prākṛta as durmaraṇa cf. yogī atyantavyādhipīḍāgrasto 'pi durmaraṇaṁ necched ity arthaḥ); (viii) Dasyus are the limit; (1) even Dasyus do not trust in those who act mercilessly (dasyavo 'py upaśaṅkante niranukrośakāriṇaḥ) 12. 131. 11; (2) even Dasyus trust ascetics (tāpaseṣu hi viśvāsam api kurvanti dasyavaḥ) 12. 87. 28; (3) The Rākṣasas refused to eat the flesh of the mean Gautama, and suggested that it might be distributed among the Dasyus; but even Dasyus did not wish to eat the flesh of the sinful and unfaithful Gautama, nor the beasts of prey 12. 166. 18-19, 22-23; (ix) Dasyus are equated with impious men; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and Vidura were born, there were no Dasyus in the Kuru land, nor other impious men (nābhavan dasyavaḥ kecin nādharmarucayo janāḥ) 1. 102. 5; (x) If Brāhmaṇas parted company with Kṣatriyas, the latter became degraded and were as good as Dasyus (apadhvastā dasyubhūtā bhavanti ye brāhmaṇāḥ kṣatriyān saṁtyajanti) 12. 74. 10. 

  E.   The Duties of Dasyus: On being questioned by Māndhātṛ about the dharma of Dasyus (kathaṁ dharmaṁ careyus te 12. 65. 15), Indra told him in details the duties of Dasyus which included service (śuṣrūṣā) to parents, teachers, elders, ascetics and kings, gifts to twice-born, observance of non-violence, truth, purity, faithfulness and other virtues 12. 65. 17-22; a Dasyu who lived within limits did not perish after his death; this is illustrated by the narrative of Kāpavya; those Dasyus who observed their dharma achieved perfections (api te dasyavo bhūtvā kṣipraṁ siddhim avāpnuyuḥ) 12. 133. 1-22. 

  F.   Limitations of Dasyus: They are not able to overpower a person who has no desires and one who is free from (the fear of) loss of wealth (na ca dasyavaḥ/ prabhavanti dhanajyāninirmuktasya nirāśiṣaḥ) 12. 170. 12. 

  G.   King's relationship with Dasyus: Indra created for a king his duty and armour, weapon and bow, for killing Dasyus (indreṇedaṁ dasyuvadhāya karma utpāditaṁ varma śastraṁ dhanuś ca) 5. 29. 27 (But Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 29. 30: karma yuddhaṁ); Brahman created Kṣatriyas for killing Dasyus who obstructed those that were engaged in agriculture, cattle-care, trade, and also those who performed the duties of Hotṛ, Adhvaryu and Udgātṛ priests (ūrdhvaṁ caiva trayī vidyā) 12. 90. 7-8 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 89. 7: ūrdhvaṁ svargam); a Kṣatriya should always be ready to kill Dasyus in battles 12. 60. 14; for a king, there is no higher duty than destroying Dasyus 12. 60. 17; their absence, (as also of beggars), in a kingdom considered desirable 12. 89. 20; a king should take his subjects into confidence by drawing their attention to the danger posed by his enemies who collaborated with Dasyus 12. 88. 26; a king must protect all the varṇas if the Dasyus tried to plunder their wives and possesions 13. 47. 44; a king who saved the beings from Dasyus and gave them wealth and happiness was a great king (dasyubhyaḥ prāṇadānāt sa dhanadaḥ sukhado virāṭ) 12. 98. 8; if a king did not protect his subjects, they could be at the mercy of Dasyus (loko 'yaṁ dasyusād bhavet) 12. 68. 20 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 68. 20: dasyusāt corādhīnāḥ); if due to a king's negligence his subjects were being robbed, such a king was Kali 12. 12. 27; Yudhiṣṭhira wanted to know if there were boundaries beyond which he should not allow Dasyus to step (asti svid dasyumaryādā yām ahaṁ parivarjaye) 12. 140. 1 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 142. 1: dasyūnām akāryakāriṇām api maryādā kācid asti ito 'dhikaṁ dasyūnāṁ na kartavyam iti); when a king behaved disregarding all restraints and in such a state Dasyus brought about total confusion, then if all varṇas took up weapons (to protect themselves) no blemish attached to them (unmaryāde pravṛtte tu dasyubhiḥ saṁkare kṛte/sarve varṇā na duṣyeyuḥ śastravanto…) 12. 79. 18; if the power of Dasyus increased (abhyutthite dasyubale), then even a Brāhmaṇa, Vaiśya or Śūdra should hold the rod of punishment in hand and protect the subjects from Dasyus; any one, Śūdra or some one else, whom the subjects, when tortured by Dasyus, turned for protection should be honoured (12. 79. 34-35, 38); a king in whose dominion hordes of Dasyus freely plundered the possessions of others, as do crows the fishes in water, was contemptible among the Kṣatriyas (sa vai kṣatriyapāṁsanaḥ) 12. 140. 28; Dasyus overpower a kingdom which has no ruler and which is weak (anindram abalaṁ rāṣṭraṁ dasyavo 'bhibhavanti ca) 12. 67. 2 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 67. 2: anindraṁ arājakaṁ ata evābalam); kings in whose dominion Brāhmaṇas were without proper means of subsistence, their oxen and draught-animals did not prosper, the churning pot (i. e. the curds in it) was not churned (because the pot was empty) when it was gifted, they became degraded like Dasyus (naiṣām ukṣā vardhate nota vāhā na gargaro mathyate saṁpradāne/apadhvastā dasyubhūtā bhavanti yeṣāṁ rāṣṭre brāhmaṇā vṛttihīnāḥ) 12. 329. 12 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 342. 19: gargaraḥ dadhīkṣutailādinipīḍanayantram/yeṣāṁ rājñāṁ kṛṣyādihīnatvāt tādṛśā rājāno naṣṭāś corāś ca bhavantīty arthaḥ; Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 68. 23: gargarā manthanyaḥ on the authority of Medinī); if a king and his Brāhmaṇa Purohita were opposed to each other, Dasyus took the side of him who was stronger of the two (anvagbalaṁ dasyavas tad bhajante) 12. 74. 8 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 73. 7: anu paścāt prakāśamānaṁ balam anvagbalaṁ yathā syāt tathā); a king might take away the wealth of Dasyus (and of those who did not perform sacrifices) 12. 134. 2; a king should always kill Dasyus and should not pardon any one on any account (nihanyāt sarvato dasyūn na kāmāt kasyacit kṣamet) 12. 76. 5; Dyumatsena told Satyavant that if Dasyus were not awarded capital punishment, there would be chaos eveywhere; in the Kali age, one would say: ‘this was mine, not his’ and normal life would be impossible (lokayātrā na caiva syāt) 12. 259. 6 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 267. 6: lokayātrā tīrthagamanavāṇijyādivyavahāraḥ kalau yuge adharmapradhāne kāle); however, a king should be careful while giving capital punishment to Dasyus, because when a Dasyu died, many other innocents dependent on him, like his wife, mother, father, son, also got killed for no fault of theirs (rājā tasmāṭ samyak pradhārayet) 12. 259. 10; but, a Dasyu, in fact, did not belong to men, nor to gods, nor to Gandharvas, nor to Pitṛs; for no one belonged to any one (kaḥ kasyeha na kaścana) 12. 259. 21 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 267. 21: dasyuvadhe tadbhāryādīnāṁ vadho nāstīty arthaḥ/sambandhābhāvāt); entering into an agreement (with Dasyus) who were ignorant and of confused mind was like trying to find a lotus in a cemetery or godliness in a Piśāca (i. e. trying to do what was impossible) (padmaṁ śmaśānād ādatte piśācāc cāpi daivatam/teṣu yaḥ samayaṁ kuryād ajñeṣu hatabuddhiṣu//) 12. 259. 22 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 267. 22: padmaṁ śavālaṅkāra(? ºram) ādatte piśācāt piśācopahatāt/ādatte cailādikam iti śeṣaḥ/kīdṛśaṁ samayaṁ daivataṁ devatāśapathādirūpam/; also cf. Critical Notes to Vol. 16 (p. 2193) on 12. 259. 22: “Lotus does not grow in cemetery, and if it does, it is not considered as holy. Similarly one does not expect good conduct or divine grace from persons possessed by ghosts. Cp. (i. e. the commentary of Paramānanda Bhaṭṭācārya) remarks at the end as follows: tad yathā padmaṁ svaguṇair utkṛṣṭaṁ śmaśānād upādāya kaścic chirasi kuryād devāya vā dadyāt, tatrāśvasīta kaḥ/bhāvipiśācādyu padravāśaṅkicetāḥ syāt-ity arthaḥ); a king who, following the Śāstra, teaches Dasyus to pay attention to place and time is not touched by sin (deśakālapratīkṣe yo dasyor darśayate nṛpaḥ/śāstrajāṁ buddhim āsthāya nainasā sa hi yujyate//) 12. 25. 11 (Nī., however, who reads marṣayate in Bom. Ed. 12. 24. 11: marṣayate dasyūn api na hanti enasā tajjena pāpena); in bad times, if a king had to take resort to a forest and live with Dasyus he should not associate with Dasyus who threw all norms of behaviour to the winds; it was easy to raise an army of Dasyus (of good behaviour) for performing fearful acts (apy araṇyaṁ samāśritya cared dasyugaṇaiḥ saha/na tv evoddhṛtamaryādair dasyubhiḥ sahitaś caret/dasyūnāṁ sulabhā senā raudrakarmasu bhārata) 12. 131. 10 (but Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 133. 11: dasyubhiḥ dasyuprāyair amātyaiḥ); when a king considered himself more prosperous than his (Dasyu) adversaries, he should turn on them and strike the (horde of) Dasyus without hesitation (yadā bahuvidhāṁ vṛddhim manyate pratilomataḥ/ tadā vivṛtya prahared dasyūnām avicārayan//) 12. 104. 38 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 103. 39: pratilomataḥ śatror apekṣayā vivṛtya prakaṭībhūya dasyūnāṁ dasyūn); Dasyus should not thoroughly annihilate even those who happened to be under their control; they should not act in a cruel manner thinking that they were very strong (tasmāt saśeṣaṁ kartavyaṁ svādhīnam api dasyubhiḥ/na balastho 'ham asmīti nṛśaṁsāni samācaret) 12. 131. 17; Dasyus, if not forced to remain within certain limits of behaviour, acted as robbers (nirmaryādā dasyavas tu bhavanti paripanthinaḥ) 12. 101. 3 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 100. 3: ye 'rthadharmayor nirmaryādās te paripanthīno nāśakā bhavanti). 

  H.   Epic events: (1) Arjuna, in his conquest of the north before the Rājasūya, conquered Dasyus who lived on mountains (dasyūn parvatavāsinaḥ) 2. 24. 15; he also conquered the Dasyus living in the forest in the northeast (prāguttarāṁ diśam ye ca vasanty āśritya dasyavaḥ/ nivasanti vane ye ca) 2. 24. 23; (2) Yudhiṣṭhira asked Saṁjaya whether the Kauravas, if they encountered the bands of Dasyus, remembered Arjuna 5. 23. 19; (3) Arjuna told Saṁjaya that when he would scatter the hordes of Dasyus gathered for the battle, Dhṛtarāṣṭra and his sons would repent 5. 47. 59; (4) On the fourteenth day of war, Sātyaki covered the earth with the shaven heads of Dasyus together with their headgears 7. 95. 40; he killed many Dasyus 7. 97. 20; (5) Kṛṣṇa told Babhru to protect the Yādava women so that they were not attacked by Dasyus due to their greed for wealth (naitā hiṁsyur dasyavo vittalobhāt) 16. 5. 4; (6) When Arjuna stopped at Pañcanada on his way to Hāstinapura with Vṛṣṇi women, Dasyus became greedy and took counsel among themselves; then, thousands of them, using sticks as weapons, attacked Vṛṣṇis desirous of looting property; they disregarded Arjuna's warning and continued their attack; Arjuna could not check them as he forgot his astras; the Vṛṣṇi warriors could not stop Dasyus running away with Vṛṣṇi women; Arjuna and the Vṛṣṇi warriors killed some of the plundering Dasyus with arrows; when Arjuna's arrows were exhausted, he killed Dasyus with the tip of his bow; but that was of no avail; before his very eyes, Dasyus (mlecchas) took away Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka women 16. 8. 44-61.

Past events: (1) Nahuṣa, during his rule, had killed hordes of Dasyus 1. 70. 26; (2) Yayāti pleased the Dasyus by completely controlling them (atarpayad…dasyūn saṁnigraheṇa ca) 1. 80. 3-4; (3) Dasyus who had stolen wealth, when pursued by royal guards, reached the hermitage of Māṇḍavya; they kept the loot in the āśrama and hid themselves due to fear; the guards asked Māṇḍavya which way the Dasyus had fled; when Māṇḍavya did not reply they searched the āśrama and found the hidden thieves (corān); the guards reported them and Māṇḍavya to the king; the king asked to kill the thieves (Dasyus) and Māṇḍavya (taṁ rājā saha taiś corair anvaśād vadhyatām iti) 1. 101. 4-11; (4) some Dasyus were in search of men who, afraid of the Dasyus, had entered a forest; the Dasyus asked the ascetic Kauśika which way the men had disappeared; Kauśika told them that they had taken resort to the forest; the cruel Dasyus found them out and killed them 8. 49. 4345; (5) Aśvagrīva (= Hayagrīva), whose limbs were cut off while fighting with Dasyus, enjoyed life in heaven 12. 25. 25; (6) In order to illustrate that a Dasyu, who observed proper limits, did not perish after death (yathā dasyuḥ samaryādaḥ pretyabhāve na naśyati) is told the story of Kāpavya; he was born of a Niṣādī by a Kṣatriya; he obtained perfection on account of his being a (good) Dasyu (since he lived righteously carrying out the duties of a Kṣatriya) (dasyutvāt siddhim āptavān); when the Brāhmaṇas, who had retired to a forest, did not accept food brought to them by Kāpavya because he was a Dasyu, he left some of it in their homes and went away early in the morning; many Dasyus who behaved cruelly disregarding the rules elected Kāpavya as their leader; they agreed to live as instructed by him and requested him to act as their father and mother; he taught them the way they should live and ended by saying that Dasyus, if they observed the rules of dharma, would obtain perfection in spite of their being Dasyus (ye punar dharmaśāstreṇa varterann iha dasyavaḥ/api te dasyavo bhūtvā kṣipraṁ siddhim avāpnuyuḥ//); the Dasyus carried out the instructions of Kāpavya and abstained from sinful deeds; Kāpavya, who by his act turned the Dasyus away from committing sins, obtained great perfection (maha tīṁ siddhim āptavān/sādhūnām ācaran kṣemaṁ dasyūn pāpān nivartayan//) 12. 133. 1-24; (7) A certain Brāhmaṇa, Gautama by name, happened to take shelter in the house of a wealthy Dasyu who was truthful and generous; Gautama got from the Dasyu new garments and wife; he lived there happily and helped the Dasyu to maintain his family; like the Dasyus, Gautama began to kill geese (vakrāṅgān) with arrows (Nī. who reads cakrāṅgān explains it as haṁsān, Bom. Ed. 12. 168. 36): the Brāhmaṇa Gautama, due to contact with Dasyus and leading their life, became similar to them (dasyubhiḥ samatām iyāt); many months passed while Gautama lived happily in the settlement of the Dasyus (dasyugrāme) killing many birds (pakṣiṇaḥ); once another Brāhmaṇa happened to arrive in that settlement of the Dasyus (dasyugrāmam); in that settlement which was full of Dasyus (grāme dasyujanākīrṇe) he searched everywhere for a Brāhmaṇa; he entered the house where Gautama lived; he recognized that Gautama belonged to Madhyadeśa; he asked Gautama how he came to live like a Dasyu (madhyadeśaparijñāto dasyubhāvaṁ gataḥ katham) 12. 162. 29-44. 

  J.   Mythological events: Gods appointed Kṛṣṇa to kill Dasyus (here Asura Naraka and his Asura followers are meant by the word Dasyu) (nyayojayan dasyuvadhāya kṛṣṇam) 5. 47. 74, 76. 

  K.   Future event: Kalki will always be engaged in killing Dasyus; they would perish crying pitiable words like ‘oh father, oh son’ (kalkiś cariṣyati mahīṁ sadā dasyuvadhe rataḥ//hā tāta hā sutety evaṁ tās tā vācaḥ sudāruṇāḥ/vikrośamānān subhṛśaṁ dasyūn neṣyati saṁśayam//) 3. 189. 5-6.

  Besides listing names of gods like Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) with Sāvitrī, Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa, Umāpati (Śiva), Virūpākṣa, Skanda, Viśākha and others, it contains also such names like Surabhi (cow), Sāgara (ocean), and Gaṅgā (river); it has names of sages like the Vālakhilyas, Kṛṣṇa-dvaipāyana, Nārada and Parvata; of Gandharvas like Viśvāvasu Hahāhuhū and others; of Apsarases like Urvaśī, Menakā, Rambhā and others; it mentions also group-gods like the Ādityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the Aśvinā, and also the Pitṛs; personified concepts like dharma, satya; divisions of time like nights and days, seasons, months, twilights; names of planets (Śukra, Brhaspati and the rest) and Nakṣatras (not listed); mythical birds (Vainateyas) and serpents (kadrujāḥ); rivers like Śatadrū, Vipāśā and others; holy places of pilgrimage like Prayāga, Prabhāsa and others; mountains like Himavant, Vindhya and the rest--all these also find a place in this list 13. 151. 3-28; together with the Ṛṣivaṁśa, this Daivatavaṁśa is described as the ‘first collection’ of its kind (eṣa vai samavāyas te ṛṣidevasamanvitaḥ/ādyaḥ prakīrtito rājan) 13. 151. 40; also ayaṁ daivatavaṁśo vai ṛṣivaṁśasamanvitaḥ 13. 151. 2; the recitation of the two vaṁśas together at two twilights is very effective in removing sins (dvisaṁdhyaṁ paṭhitaḥ putra kalmāṣāpaharaḥ paraḥ) 13. 151. 2; (sarvapāpapramocanaḥ) 13. 151. 40; (mucyate sarvakilbiśaiḥ) 13. 151. 29; one who recites these names of gods or welcomes their recitation is freed of dangers from all quarters and from sins arising from all kinds of promiscuous behaviour (stuvaṁś ca pratinandaṁś ca mucyate sarvato bhayāt/sarvasaṁkarapāpebhyo devatāstavanandakaḥ//) 13. 151. 29.

*2nd word in left half of page p185  (+offset) in original book.Dvāpara  : m., nt.: Name of the third Yuga among the four Yugas. 

  A.   Place among the four Yugas: Its place is third, mentioned after the Tretā and before the Kali (kṛtaṁ tretā dvāparaṁ ca puṣyaṁ ca kuruvardhana) 6. 11. 3; 12. 224. 18; the Dvāpara starts when the Tretā ends (tretānirmokṣasamaye dvāparapratipādane) 12. 139. 14; and the Kali starts when the Dvāpara ends (saṅkṣepād dvāparasyātha tataḥ puṣyaṁ pravartate) 6. 11. 4; hence also the junctions of the Tretā and the Dvāpara on the one hand and of the Dvāpara and the Kali on the other are referred to 1. 2. 3; 12. 139. 13; 12. 326. 78; 1. 2. 9; 12. 326. 82. 

  B.   Duration: Mārkaṇḍeya told Yudhiṣṭhira that the duration of the Dvāpara Yuga was two thousand years with dawns and twilights of two hundred years each at both ends (tathā varṣasahasre dve dvāparaṁ parimāṇataḥ/ tasyāpi dviśatī saṁdhyā saṁdhyāṁśas ca tataḥ param//saṁdhyāsaṁdhyāṁśayos tulyaṁ pramāṇam upadhāraya) 3. 186. 2021 (for Nī's explanation of saṁdhyā and saṁdhyāṁśa see above  Kali,  section  C,  p. 234); the same duration for the Dvāpara was told by Vyāsa to Śuka without naming the Yuga, but indicating it in relation to the Kṛta 12. 224. 20. 

  C.   Events occurring in the Dvāpara: (1) Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that formerly, at the junction of the Tretā and the Dvāpara, there occurred a terrible drought lasting for twelve years due to the working of the fate (daivavidhikramāt); when the Tretā was about to end and the Dvāpara was to set in Indra did not release rain for twelve years (tretānirmokṣasamaye dvāparapratipādane//na vavarṣa sahasrākṣaḥ) 12. 139. 13-15; (2) Sūta Ugraśravas told the sages assembled in the Naimiṣa forest that at the junction of the Tretā and the Dvāpara (tretādvāparayoḥ saṁdhau) Rāma destroyed the princely Kṣatriyas again and again 1. 2. 3 (but see the next event); (3) Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) told Nārada that at the junction of the Tretā and the Dvāpara (saṁdhau tu samanuprāpte tretāyāṁ dvāparasya ca) he would be born as Rāma, son of Daśaratha 12. 326. 78; (4) Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) told Nārada that towards the end of the junction of the Dvāpara and the Kali (dvāparasya kaleś caiva saṁdhau paryavasānike) he would be born in Mathurā for (the killing of) Kaṁsa 12. 326. 82; (5) at the junction of the Dvāpara and the Kali the armies of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas fought each other near Samantapañcaka 1. 2. 9. 

  D.   Kṛṣṇa-Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu) and the Dvāpara: (1) Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) told Mārkaṇḍeya that he has red colour in the Dvāpara Yuga (rakto dvāparam āsādya) 3. 187. 31; but according to Hanūmant Viṣṇu becomes yellow in the Dvāpara (dvāpare 'pi yuge… viṣṇur vai pītatāṁ yāti) 3. 148. 26; (3) Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that Kṛṣṇa was strength in the Dvāpara (balaṁ tv āsīd dvāpare pārtha kṛṣṇaḥ) 13. 143. 9. 

  E.   King and the Dvāpara: According to Utathya Aṅgiras all the four Yugas depend on the king's behaviour, hence a king himself is called Yuga (rājavṛttāni sarvāṇi rājaiva yugam ucyate) 12. 92. 6; Bhīṣma had no doubt that all the Yugas were rooted in a king (rājamūlāni sarvāṇi mama nāsty atra saṁśayaḥ) 12. 139. 10; it is the king who created a Yuga--whether it was the Kṛta, the Tretā, or the Dvāpara 5. 130. 16 = 12. 70. 25 (also cf. rājā kālasya kāraṇam 5. 130. 15 = 12. 70. 6); when a king gives up half of the daṇḍanīti and practises only one half of it, then the Dvāpara age sets in (ardhaṁ tyaktvā yadā rājā nītyardham anuvartate/tatas tu dvāparaṁ nāma sa kālaḥ saṁpravartate//) 12. 70. 16; the dharma practised by the king in the Dvāpara is deficient in two quarters (dvāpare tu dvipādena (ūnaḥ)) 12. 259. 32; by bringing about the Dvāpara a king lives in heaven only according to his share (i. e. not for a long time) (pravartanād dvāparasya (svargam) yathābhāgam ypāśnute) 5. 130. 17 = 12. 70. 27; (description of the behaviour of people in the Dvāpara in the absence of the daṇḍanīti 12. 65. 24-27). 

  F.   Dvāpara and dharma: In the Dvāpara Yuga, dharma will lose two of its four feet and the age will be marked by a mixture (of dharma and adharma) (tato vai dvāparaṁ nāma miśraḥ kālo bhaviṣyati/dvipādahīno dharmaś ca yuge tasmin bhaviṣyati) 12. 327. 75; (dvāpare 'rdhena vyāmiśro dharma ucyate) 3. 188. 11 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 190. 10: ardhena adharmeṇa); (aśubhasya tadā ardhaṁ dvāv aṁśāv anuvartate) 12. 70. 17; (dvāpare 'pi yuge dharmo dvibhāgonaḥ pravartate) 3. 148. 26; 12. 259. 32; in the Yugas that follow the Kṛta the traditional dharma is displaced successively by one quarter and instead adharma increases due to the practice of theft, falsehood and deceit 12. 224. 23; the dharmas in the Dvāpara are different from those in the Kṛta and the Tretā 12. 224. 26 = 12. 252. 8; according to Mārkaṇḍeya, however, the dharma for the Kṛta, the Tretā and the Dvāpara was the same (eṣa ḍharmaḥ kṛtayuge tretāyāṁ dvāpare tathā) 3. 189. 13; sacrifice was considered to be the best dharma for the Dvāpara (dvāpare yajñam evāhuḥ (uttamam)) 12. 224. 27; Hanūmant told Bhīma that the times in different Yugas were different; he and Bhīma lived at a time when the Dvāpara was about to end and hence he could not assume the form he had taken in the earlier Yuga (ayaṁ pradhvaṁsanaḥ kālo nādya tad rūpam asti me) 3. 148. 6; Kṛṣṇa-Vāsudeva, along with Saṁkaraṣṇa, is praised following the Sātvata rites when the Dvāpara ends, and the Kali begins (dvāparasya yugasyānte ādau kaliyugasya ca/ sātvataṁ vidhiṁ āsthāya gītaḥ saṁkarṣaṇena yaḥ (i. e. kṛṣṇaḥ) 6. 62. 39. 

  G.   Dvāpara, sacrifice and the Vedas: Vyāsa told his son Śuka that on account of the limitation on the life expectancy (of human beings) sacrifices, in the Dvāparayuga, get into disarray (saṁrcdhād āyuṣas tv ete (i. e. yajñāḥ) vyasyante dvāpare yuge) 12. 224. 65 = 12. 230. 14; they fall into ruin (dvāpare viplavaṁ yānti yajñāḥ) 12. 224. 62 = 12. 230. 15 (viplavaṁ yānti vedāḥ); however, sacrifice considered to be the best dharma for the Dvāpara (dvāpare yajñam evāhuḥ (uttamam) 12. 224. 27; Hanūmant told Bhīma that in the Dvāpara the Veda is fourtold; hence some study all the four Vedas, others three, two, or one; but some do not study a single ṛc; as men did not realize the sacred text to be one Veda, the Veda was divided into many (Vedas) (dvāpare 'pi yuge…caturdhā veda eva ca//tato 'nye ca caturvedās trivedāś ca tathāpare/dvivedāś caikavedāścāpy anṛcaś ca tathāpare//…ekavedasya cājñānād vedās te bahavaḥ kṛtāḥ) 3. 148. 26-27, 29 (Nī., on Bom. Ed. 3. 149. 28, offers an alternative explanation: yad vā caturvedā iti vedatrayoktaṁ karma jyotiṣṭomādikam/atharvaṇopaniṣaduktam dhyānaṁ ca sahaiva vānutiṣṭhantīti karmopāstisamuccaya uktaḥ/trivedā iti kevalakarmaṭhāḥ/dvivedā iti svaśākhoktaṁ saṁdhyāvandanādi karma dhyānaṁ cānutiṣṭhanti/ekavedā dhyānaikaniṣṭhāḥ/ anṛcaḥ kṛtakṛtyāḥ/); (also cf. Maheśvara (Viṣṇu) recommending the performance of sacrifices to satisfy the gods and the gods, on their part, sustaining the worlds in the (three) Yugas other than the Kṛta 12. 327. 53-60). 

  H.   Nature: According to the description of the Dvāpara given by Hanūmant to Bhīma, since in that age the Vedas become fourfold and the śāstras multiply, the Vedic rites are variously performed; people, given to austerities and gifts, become rājasa by nature; since truth falls down, rarely any one abides by truth (evaṁ śāstreṣu bhinneṣu bahudhā niyate kṛiyā/ tapodānapravṛttā ca rājasī bhavati prajā// …satyasya ceha vibhraṁśāt satye kaścid avasthitaḥ//) 3. 148. 28-29; for further description of the Dvāpara cf. 3. 148. 30-31; Hanūmant concludes that people in the Dvāpara perish due to the practice of adharma (evaṁ dvāparam āsādya prajāḥ kṣīyanty adharmataḥ) 3. 148. 32; according to Saṁjaya, in the Dvāpara all the four varṇas are full of energy; they are great heroes, desirous of killing each other; on the whole, the Dvāpara in which Saṁjaya lived was characterized by contraction (of the merits in all respects) (sarvavarṇā mahārāja jāyante dvāpare sati/mahotsāhā mahāvīryāḥ parasparavadhaiṣiṇaḥ//…saṁkṣepo vartate rājan dvāpare 'smin narādhipa) 6. 11. 11, 14 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 10. 15: saṁkṣepo guṇānām iti śeṣaḥ); Vyāsa told Śuka that all the varṇas and the āśramas fall into disarray due to the limitation on the life-span (varṇāśramās tathā/saṁrcdhād āyuṣas tv ete vyasyante dvāpare yuge) 12. 230. 14; he also said that people in the Dvāpara (as in the Tretā and the Kali) entertain doubt (tretāyāṁ dvāpare caiva kalijāś ca sasaṁśayāḥ 12. 230. 7) as to what is at the root of a man's success-his effort, fate, or nature 12. 230. 4; in the Dvāpara, the earth has to be ploughed and even then it does not yield much harvest (kṛṣṭapacyaiva pṛthivī bhavaty alpaphalā tathā) 12. 70. 17; in this Yuga people have to copulate to beget progeny (dvāpare maithuno dharmaḥ prajānām abhavan nṛpa) 12. 200. 37; evil tribes like the Talavaras and the Andharkas from the south and the Yaunas (Yavanas) and the Gāndhāras from the north move on earth from the Tretā onwards (i. e. also in the Dvāpara) 12. 200. 39-40, 42. 

  I.   Life expectancy: Vyāsa told his son Śuka that the life expectancy of people diminishes by a quarter in each succeeding Yuga after the Kṛta, hence in the Dvāpara they live for two hundred years (…tretādiṣv eteṣāṁ pādaśo hrasate vayaḥ) 12. 224. 24; Vyāsa also told Śuka that according to his information life expectancy of people, along with other things, gradually decreased in the successive Yugas (…anuyugaṁ hrasantīti ca naḥ śrutam/āyūṁṣi…) 12. 224. 25; this is also what Mārkaṇḍeya told Yudhiṣṭhira (āyur…manuṣyāṇām anuyugaṁ hrasatīti nibodha me) 3. 188. 13; according to Saṁjaya, however, the life expectancy of people in the Dvāpara was two thousand years (āyuḥsaṁkhyā…saṁktyātā…/dvisahasraṁ dvāpare tu) 6. 11. 5-6 (apparently Saṁjaya made confusion between the duration of the Dvāpara age and the life expectancy of people in that Yuga). 

  J.   Simile: The place where the river Narmadā passes along the Vaiḍūrya mountain is compared to the junction of the Tretā (f.) and the Dvāpara (m.) 3. 121. 18-19. 

  K.   Name of Sūrya: Dvāpara appears as 48th name among the hundred and eight names of Sūrya taught by Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22. [The words kṛta, tretā, dvāpara and kali occurring in 5. 140. 7-15 are wrongly interpreted by Nīlakaṇṭha (Bom. Ed. 5. 142. 7-15) as names of the four Yugas, and not as the names of the throws in the game of dice].

  G.

  H.   Padma's functions: It was his duty to pull by rotation the sun's one-wheeled chariot for a month (in a year ?) (sūryarathaṁ voḍhuṁ gato'sau māsacārikaḥ 12. 345. 8; vivasvato gacchati paryayeṇa voḍhuṁ bhavāṁs taṁ ratham ekacakram 12. 350. 1). 

  I.   Padma and the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya (12. 349. 5): Padma returned home after he had performed his duty of drawing the Sun's chariot and was permitted by the god to leave; he was then informed by his wife about the arrival of a Brāhmaṇa; she informed Padma that the Brāhmaṇa had asked him to meet him; Padma's initial reaction, due to his sense of pride, was not to oblige the Brāhmaṇa; but on the advice of his wife he relented and met the Brāhmaṇa; he then told his wife that he realized that it was not in one's interest to get angry for in bygone days, Rāvaṇa, Kārtavīrya and his sons were killed due to their anger 12. 348. 13-17; he approached the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya and asked him what he wanted 12. 349. 3-4, 9-12; the Brāhmaṇa first asked Padma a question; after hearing Padma's answer, the Brāhmaṇa would tell Padma the purpose of his visit 12. 349. 16; the Brāhmaṇa asked Padma to tell him if while pulling the god Sun's chariot. he saw anything wonderful on his way 12. 350. 1; Padma first told the Brāhmaṇa that there was nothing more wonderful than the Sun himself (accomplished sages and deities resort to his rays; wind resorts to sun's rays and flows from there to fill the sky; rain water is released by his dark foot (ray ?), Śukra by name, (śukro nāmāsitaḥ pādo yasya vāridharo 'mbare/toyaṁ sṛjati varṣāsu 12. 350. 4); Sun takes back the rain water with his shining ray during eight months; the soul (ātmā) is for all times established in his lustre; he is the seed of everything, movable and immovable and the earth is sustained by him; the longarmed, eternal, unalterable god having no beginning and no end resides in the sun 12. 350. 2-7); Padma next told him that one day something unusual happened: while the Sun was shining brightly at mid-day, there suddenly appeared light in all directions, light similar to that of the sun; then, as if tearing open the sky a being, looking like a second Sun (dvitīya iva bhāskaraḥ 12. 350. 11), approached the Sun; the Sun held out his hand to receive him and the other being also extended his right hand to hold the Sun's hand; then the being entered the Sun's disc 12. 350. 8-15; confused as to who was the real Sun--the one in the chariot or the one that arrived from the sky--Padma and others asked the Sun to explain; the Sun told them that the one who entered him was a sage who observed the vow of uñchavṛtti (living only on grains fallen in the field); the sage also lived successively on fruit, roots, fallen leaves, water and air and recited the ṛc stanzas; that Brāhmaṇa (sage) even now moved round the earth with the Sun --this was the wonder seen by Padma 12. 351. 1-6; the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya, on hearing Padma's account, took leave of him without telling him the purpose of his visit; to the perplexed Padma, Dharmāraṇya explained that he was only curious to know what led to the accumulation of merit (puṇyasaṁcaya); now that he knew how one did it, he had decided to observe uñchavrata; the purpose of his visit was served (kṛtārtho 'smi) and hence he was leaving 12. 352. 1-10.

Uses: (1) In the epic war: (i) when the Pāṇḍava warriors reached Kurukṣetra they blew their respective conches and so did Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna 5. 149. 64-65; (ii) when the two armies were arrayed against each other, ready to fight, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna blew their conches 6. 1. 17; 6. 23. 15; (iii) Kṛṣṇa blew his Pāñcajanya at the start of the second day's war 6. 47. 25 (and presumably at the start of the war on all subsequent days); (iv) when Arjuna vowed to fight more seriously with Bhīṣma 6. 55. 102; (v) when Arjuna rushed at Bhīṣma who was fighting with other Pāṇḍavas 6. 67. 2; (vi) Kṛṣṇa blew his conch when Arjuna took the vow to kill Jayadratha 7. 51. 41; (vii) at the start of the day on which Jayadratha was killed 7. 64. 20; when Arjuna was heading forward looking for Jayadratha in the Kaurava army 7. 75. 31; as Arjuna was nearing Jayadratha 7. 78. 37; 7. 79. 11; at the end of the day when Jayadratha was killed 7. 123. 41; [It is significant that the sounding of Pāñcajanya is mentioned on many occasions on the day on which Arjuna had to fulfil his difficult vow to kill Jayadratha]; (viii) Kṛṣṇa blew it when Arjuna got rid of the Saṁśaptakas who had overwhelmed both of them 8. 37. 19, 15-17; (ix) at the death of Karṇa and the subsequent rout of the Kaurava army 8. 68. 57; (x) at the fall of Duryodhana 9. 60. 65; (2) Outside the epic war: Kṛṣṇa blew it to challenge Śālva when he reached Śālva's Saubhapura 3. 15. 20; when Kṛṣṇa started fighting with Śālva 3. 21. 12; when, during his fight with Śālva, Kṛṣṇa killed many Dānavas 3. 21. 29-30; 

  G.   Its use as a signal: (1) Kṛṣṇa had told Dāruka, his charioteer, that when he heard the sound of Pāñcajanya he was to rush to the battle-field driving Kṛṣṇa's chariot for its eventual use by Kṛṣṇa to enable Arjuna to fulfil his vow to kill Jayadratha 7. 56. 36; (2) The sound was once interpreted by Droṇa to mean that Arjuna wanted to set aside other heroes and attack Bhīṣma 6. 108. 14; (3) It was once interpreted by Yudhiṣṭhira to mean that Arjuna was in danger 7. 85. 35; on another occasion, the sound meant for Yudhiṣṭhira the death of Arjuna, and hence Kṛṣṇa's starting to fight 7. 102. 32-33. 

  H.   End: When the time of the destruction of the Vṛṣṇis and the Andhakas arrived the blowing of Pāñcajanya in their houses was accompanied by the harsh braying of the asses 16. 3. 15 [nadantaṁ pāñcajanyaṁ ca vṛṣṇyandhakaniveśane/samantāt pratyavāśyanta rāsabhā dāruṇasvarāḥ// Does Pāñcajanya here refer not to Kṛṣṇa's special conch, but to the conches in general in the houses of the Vṛṣṇis and the Andhakas ?].

  D.   Epic events: (1) During his exile Arjuna, after visiting the other tīrthas on the west coast, went to Prabhāsa; Kṛṣṇa, having come to know that Arjuna had arrived at the Prabhāsadeśa, went there to meet him; the two met at Prabhāsa; they sported there according to their wishes and from there they went to the Raivataka mountain 1. 210. 2-4, 8; (2) The Brāhmaṇas wished to visit the Prabhāsa and the other tīrthas along with Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 91. 10; (3) After visiting Śūrpāraka, Yudhiṣṭhira went to Prabhāsa; he bathed there and, with his brothers and Kṛṣṇā, gave offerings to gods and manes; the Brāhmaṇas and Lomaśa too offered there to gods and manes; Yudhiṣṭhira practised there severe austerities 3. 118. 15-17; (4) Balarāma and Janārdana, along with the Vṛṣṇi heroes, went to Prabhāsa to meet the Pāṇḍavas; the Pāṇḍavas and the Vṛṣṇis held consultations together at Prabhāsa 3. 118. 18; 3. 119. 1-3; (5) Arjuna, in his wanderings with the sacrificial horse, came to Prabhāsa from Gokarṇa 14. 84. 12; (6) Balarāma, in his tīrthayātrā, first went to Prabhāsa 9. 34. 36; (7) The Yādavas, desirous of visiting a tīrtha, went to Prabhāsa and lived there; there they were engaged in a drinking bout (prāvartata mahāpānaṁ prabhāse); in the mutual killing that followed the Vṛṣṇi heroes, the Bhojas and the Andhakas were all destroyed at Prabhāsa 16. 9. 8-9. 

  E.   Past and mythological events: (1) At Prabhāsa Kṛṣṇa, observing restraint (niyame sthitaḥ) stood on one foot for a thousand divine years (divyaṁ varṣasahasrakam) to practise austerities 3. 13. 14; (2) The sages Śukra, Aṅgiras and others who came together at Prabhāsa thought of going on a tīrthayātrā from there; (3) Soma was cursed by Dakṣa; as a result he was emaciated and could not shine; Dakṣa Prajāpati advised him to go to the tīrtha of Sarasvatī (i. e. Prabhāsa) and emerge from there after taking a bath; when Soma did this he could wax again; but for one half of the month he would wane; so Soma went to Prabhāsa and emerged after bath on the new moon day; he could illuminate the worlds; the gods then reached Prabhāsa and, in the company of Soma, met Dakṣa; this is why Prabhāsa became the most excellent of all the tīrthas (prabhāsaṁ ca yathā tīrthaṁ tīrthānāṁ pravaraṁ hy abhūt); on every new moon day the moon bathes in Prabhāsa and waxes again; that is why Prabhāsa is so called 9. 34. 67-77; 9. 34. 36-39; (the bath in the Hiraṇyasaras tīrtha, which later became known as Prabhāsa, was prescribed for Soma by the sages 12. 329. 46).

*2nd word in left half of page p438  (+offset) in original book.Vardhamānadvāra, Vardhamānapuradvāra  : nt.: Name of the gate of Hāstinapura facing the town Vardhamāna.

  Epic events: (1) Kuntī, after the death of Pāṇḍu, came in the company of the ascetics and her sons to Kurujāṅgala and from there she reached the Vardhamānapuradvāra before entering Hāstinapura (sā…saṁprāptā kurujāṅgalam/vardhamānapuradvāraṁ āsasāda yaśasvinī//) 1. 117. 8 (Nī. on Bom.

K. Belvalkar, means ‘an entrance or exit other than the southern’, cf. dakṣiṇādvārahīnaṁ tu vardhamānam udāhṛtam from the Bṛhatsaṁhitā of Varāhamihira 53. 33. 36 cited by him. Dr. Belvalkar further observes: “It is also the name of a specific gate of Hastināpura”, his note on the stanza in the Cr. Ed. Vol. 19, p. 153. The Bṛhatsaṁhitā passage, however, seems to mean that a house which does not have a gate to the south is called Vardhamāna. The editions of the Bṛhatsaṁhitā consulted by me read in 53. 33 as tadvac ca (or tasmiṁś ca) vardhamāne dvāraṁ tu na dakṣiṇaṁ kāryam).

  A.   Description: heavenly (divya) 5. 181. 13; 7. 132. 28; best (uttama) 1. 218. 15; very fierce (sudāruṇa) 6. 98. 20. 

  B.   Its knowledge: Arjuna learnt it from god Vāyu when he, after satisfying Mahādeva (Śiva), received it in the heaven along with many other heavenly weapons 1. 225. 12 (pl. vāyavyāni); 3. 164. 29; 3. 161. 28 (Vāta); 4. 56. 14 (Mātariśvan); 6. 116. 38; but apparently he had also learnt it earlier from Droṇa since he used it while displaying his skill in archery (1. 125. 19), and at the time of burning the Khāṇḍava forest (1. 218. 15); Droṇa, of course, knew it, and it was known to many other epic heroes, viz. Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Karṇa, Aśvatthāman, Yudhiṣṭhira, and the Pāṇḍya king (see the next section); it was known also, perhaps, to Kṛṣṇa 6. 116. 39. 

  C.   Use: (1) In the epic war: (i) by Arjuna, agaisnt the Trigartas; noticing its employment, Droṇa repelled it with the Śaila astra 6. 98. 18-20; against the Saṁśaptakas, to scatter their shower of arrows, when they covered Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna with their arrows; the two, therefore, could not be seen and were mistaken to be dead 7. 18. 17-22; god Vāyu carried away the Saṁśaptakas together with their horses, elephants, chariots and weapons like dried leaves; they looked like birds flying from trees 7. 18. 17-23; agaisnt Droṇa to repel the Vāyavyāstra released by him 7. 163. 28 (here not specifically named: astṛāṇy astrair yadā tasya vidhivad dhanti pāṇḍavaḥ); against Karṇa, to scatter the clouds created by his Vāruṇāstra 8. 67. 11; (ii) by Droṇa, against Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 132. 28; again against Yudhiṣṭhira, when Droṇa was for a moment distressed by Yudhiṣṭhira's arrow and had to sit down in the chariot 7. 137. 40-42; against the army of king Drupada to blow it away, as wind blows away the clouds 7. 136. 10; 7. 132. 37; against Arjuna 7. 163. 28; (iii) by Yudhiṣṭhira, to combat successfully the same Astra used against him by Droṇa (astram astreṇa jaghnivān) 7. 132. 28; again to halt the same Astra used against him by Droṇa (tad astram astreṇa raṇe stambhayām āsa) 7. 137. 42; (iv) by Aśvatthāman, against Ghaṭotkaca to blow him away (vyadhamat) when Ghaṭotkaca employed his māyā to become a dark cloud to attack Aśvatthāman 7. 131. 71-72; (v) by Karṇa, against Ghaṭotkaca under similar conditions 7. 150. 70-71; (vi) by the Pāṇḍya king, to obstruct (rudh-) the shower of arrows released by Aśvatthāman on his army 8. 15. 30-31; (2) Outside the epic war--(i) Arjuna used it by reciting mantras (abhimantrya) to dispel the clouds and the lightning created by Vāyu and Indra at the time of burning the Khāṇḍava forest 1. 218. 15; Arjuna used it against Kirāta (Śiva), but the missile had no effect on him 3. 163. 29-30; against Droṇa at the time of the cattle-raid to swallow the Vāyavyāstra used by Droṇa (vāyavyaṁ… astram astreṇa pāṇḍavaḥ/…grasate sma…) 4. 53. 48; against Bhīṣma at the time of the cattle raid 4. 59. 21; at the time of displaying his skill in the use of missiles 1. 125. 19; (ii) by Bhīṣma, against Arjuna at the time of the cattle-raid 4. 59. 21; against Rāma Jāmadagnya who combated it with the use of the Guhyakāstra 5. 181. 11; (iii) by Droṇa, against Arjuna at the time of the cattle-raid 4. 53. 48; (iv) the effect of the Vāyavyāstra was produced by the Nivātakavaca demons by employing their māyā while fighting with Arjuna; it produced wind, the velocity of which was obstructed by Arjuna by the use of the Śaila astra (śailena ca mahāstreṇa vāyor vegam adhārayam) 3. 168. 9-10; the demons again practised their different māyās simultaneously (prākurvan vividhā māyā yaugapadyena) and produced the Astra of Vāyu (along with that of Agni and the Aśmavarṣa); it oppressed Arjuna and produced darkness all around, which was dispelled by Arjuna by employing his Astramāyā 3. 168. 11-13, 25-26. 

  D.   Effects: Arjuna created wind by the use of the Vāyavya astra (vāyavyenāsṛjad vāyum) 1. 125. 19; the wind that was released by the use of the missile agitated the sky, felled the trees, and killed soldiers 6. 98. 18-20; when used against the Saṁśaptakas, god Vāyu (bhagavān vāyuḥ) swept them away together with their horses, elephants, chariots and weapons, like dried leaves; they appeared like birds flying away from trees 7. 18. 22-23. [See  Vāyuvarṣa ]

*2nd word in right half of page p441  (+offset) in original book.Vinatā  : f.: A mythical female being. 

  A.   Family: One of the two daughters of Prajāpati, sister of Kadrū (1. 19. 1), both married to Kaśyapa 1. 14. 5-6; one of the thirteen daughters of Dakṣa 1. 59. 12-13; hence called Dākṣāyaṇī 1. 27. 24. 

  B.   Description: Divine (devī) 1. 14. 15; beautiful, wonderful and faultless 1. 14. 5; shining (śubhā, also 1. 14. 5), auspicious (kalyāṇī) and famous (yaśasvinī) 1. 27. 24. 

  C.   Progeny: (1) Kaśyapa, her husband, granted her a boon (also 1. 31. 2); she chose to have two sons, stronger than the sons of Kadrū; but the husband granted her one and a half sons as desired (? adhyardhaṁ putram īpsitam 1. 14. 9) [thus in view of the fact that one of her two sons was not fully developed ? 1. 14. 16; 1. 27. 34]; when the husband said “so be it”, Vinatā was delighted to know that she will have two strong sons 1. 14. 610; after a long time Vinatā laid two eggs which were preserved for five hundred years in warm pots by the female attendants (sopasvedeṣu bhāṇḍeṣu 1. 14. 13; Nī. sopasvedeṣu uṣmavatsu on 1. 16. 15 Bom. Ed.); when after five hundred years Kadrū's sons came out of the eggs but nothing came out of the two eggs laid by Vinatā, she, ashamed and desirous of quickly having a son, broke one of the two eggs and saw her partly developed son; angered, the son cursed his mother (also 1. 31. 1) for her impatience, to become the slave (dāsī 1. 14. 17) of Kadrū with whom she vied; he also told the mother that her second son will free her from slavery if she did not break the other egg prematurely and produce a son deficient in limbs; the undeveloped son became Aruṇa; her second son, Garuḍa, was born at proper time; as soon as born he left Vinatā and flew into the sky 1. 14. 12-22; 1. 26. 36; (2) Vinatā, desirous of having a son, practised penance and observed vows; having bathed and become pure she approached her husband Kaśyapa for bringing forth a male child; Kaśyapa told her that her effort would succeed and that she would give birth to heroic sons; he also told her to carefully bear the garbha; Vinatā delighted when thus addressed by her husband; she gave birth to Aruṇa and Garuḍa 1. 27. 24-28; 33-34; hence Aruṇa and Garuḍa called vainateyau ‘sons of Vinatā’ 1. 31. 2 (See Garuḍa); (3) the two sons born due to the penance of Vālakhilyas and the conception of Kaśyapa (tapasā vālakhilyānāṁ mama saṁkalpajau tathā/bhaviṣyato mahābhāgau putrau te lokapūjitau) 1. 27. 27; 1. 27. 1-2; besides Aruṇa and Garuḍa, Tārkṣya, Ariṣṭanemi, Āruṇi, Vāruṇi also called vainateyāḥ 1. 59. 39; 1. 114. 62 (with slight difference, Asitadhvaja in place of Vāruṇi); the line of Suparṇas descending from her (vinatākula), of noble family, propogated by Garuḍa through his six sons 5. 99. 1-4; [See Vainateya^1]. 

  D.   Slave of Kadrū: Once the two sisters Kadrū and Vinatā happened to see the horse Uccaiḥśravas from very near 1. 15. 1; Kadrū later asked Vinatā the colour of the horse; Vinatā declared it to be white and asked Kadrū's opinion; Vinatā was ready to put a wager on it; Kadrū declared that the horse had dark hair on its tail; the two agreed to lay a wager with slavery as stake; they then went home agreeing to inspect the horse the next day 1. 18. 2-5; next morning the two sisters went to inspect Uccaiḥśravas from near; they crossed the ocean on the way 1. 19. 1-3; when they found that there were many black hair on the tail of Uccaiḥśravas, Kadrū made Vinatā her slave; Vinatā who lost the bet and was defeated was grieved to be reduced to the condition of a slave 1. 20. 1-3; 1. 49. 6; once when Garuḍa visited the slave Vinatā on the other shore of the ocean, Kadrū asked Vinatā in the presence of Garuḍa to take her to the beautiful Rāmaṇīyaka, the abode of the nāgas in the middle of the ocean; Vinatā did as commanded and Garuḍa, as directed by his mother, carried the serpents 1. 21. 1-5; Garuḍa asked Vinatā why he must act as told by the serpents; Vinatā informed him that she having lost the wager had become the slave of her sister; the serpents, on being asked by Garuḍa how he (and his mother) could be free from slavery, told him to get amṛta for them to win freedom from slavery 1. 23. 8-12; Garuḍa got ready to fetch amṛta and asked Vinatā what he might eat on way; Vinatā asked him to eat the Niṣādas whose abode lay far away in the middle of the ocean (samudrakukṣāv ekānte 1. 24. 2), and warned him never to injure a Brāhmaṇa 1. 24. 1-3; on being further asked by Garuḍa how he could recognize a Brāhmaṇa, Vinatā told him: “who, when swallowed, burns your throat like a heated charcoal, know him to be a Brāhmaṇa”; then Vinatā, although she knew the incomparable prowess of her son, blessed him as follows: “May Wind protect your wings, Moon your back, Fire your head, and Sun the whole of you; myself shall always endeavour for your comfort and well-being (śāntisvastiparāyaṇā 1. 24. 9); may your path be free from obstacles and may you succeed in your task” 1. 24. 5-9; on way Garuḍa met his father and told him that he was on his way to fetch soma in order to free his mother from slavery; he also told him that he was asked by Vinatā to eat the Niṣādas but was not satisfied even after eating thousands of them; he asked Kaśyapa what else he might eat 1. 25. 7-9; when Garuḍa succeeded in getting soma (amṛta) he approached his mother and told the serpents that since he was leaving the amṛta for them on kuśa grass his mother should be freed from slavery from that day; the serpents said: “so be it”; Garuḍa then roamed in the forest with his mother Vinatā and gave delight to her 1. 30. 14-17, 21. 

  E.   Functions: Vinatā is one of those (like Surasā, Surabhi and many others) who wait upon Pitāmaha in his sabhā 2. 11. 29, 31. 

  F.   Svāhā identified with Vinatā ?: Svāhā, the daughter of Dakṣa (3. 213. 50) while getting away with the seed of Agni assumed the form of a female Garuḍa (garuḍī), a female Suparṇa (suparṇī) to escape identification 3. 214. 7-10); 3. 215. 3; Svāhā as Vinatā (as Suparṇī 3. 215. 4) told Skanda that he was her son qualified to give her the śrāddha oblation (mama tvaṁ piṇḍadaḥ sutaḥ) 3. 219. 12; as one of the mothers of Skanka, Vinatā, highly ferocious, assumes the form of a śikunigraha (bird-affliction ?) to torment young children until they are sixteen years old 3. 219. 26, 22, 41.

Here it seems to mean a particular (disgusting ?) tribe of Śakas who were horse-riders (cf. aSvapuruza in 6. 1. 7); (8) On the twelfth day, Śakas were among those who occupied the ‘neck’ (grīvāyām) of the Suparṇavyūha (7. 19. 4) of Kauravas 7. 19. 7-8; (9) On the fourteenth day, fierce Śakas, Yavanas and others formed innumerable hordes in hundreds and thousands (vrātāḥ śatasahasraśaḥ) to attack Arjuna; he fought them with arrows and cut them off with his skill in shooting arrows (aśātayat…astramāyayā); afraid, they all fled 7. 68. 41-45; (10) The same day, Sātyaki expected to encounter them in his onward march towards Arjuna (śakaiś cāpi sameṣyāmi) 7. 87. 50; Sātyaki asked his charioteer to drive his chariot to Śakas and other Mlecchas who, riding chariots and elephants and holding different kinds of weapons in their hands, were eager to fight with him (mām evābhimukhāḥ sarve tiṣṭhanti samarārthinaḥ); Sātyaki was confident to defeat them 7. 95. 13-14; in the encounter that followed, Śakas and others showered arrows on Sātyaki; he cut off their arrows and killed them by thousands covering the earth with their blood and flesh; those who escaped death fled swiftly in fright; Sātyaki thus defeated the large army of Śakas 7. 95. 32-33, 38-39, 45; three thousand horse-riders of Śakas and others, led by Duryodhana, returned to the battlefield to attack Sātyaki; he killed many of them 7. 97. 13-14, 20; (11) On the seventeenth day, Kāmbojas, Śakas and Yavanas, led by Saṁśaptakas guarded the extremity of the left side (vāmaṁ pārśvam apālayan…teṣāṁ prapakṣaḥ) of the Bārhaspatyavyūha (8. 31. 26) of Kauravas 8. 31. 14-15; in the course of that day, after the death of the younger brother of Kāmboja Sudakṣiṇa, there was fierce fighting (ghoram adbhutadarśanam) in which Śakas riding horses took part; a large number of them were killed 8. 40. 107-110; later that day, Kṛṣṇa in order to encourage Arjuna told him that Śakas had joined the Kaurava army for the sake of Duryodhana and no one else but he (Arjuna) could defeat them (na śakyā yudhi nirjetuṁ tvadanyena paraṁtapa) 8. 51. 18, 20; Śakas, who held excellent weapons in their hands and were ready to shoot arrows, riding horses, chariots and elephants, rushed at Arjuna to kill him (ātatāyinaḥ/śakās…//varāyudhān pāṇigatān); Arjuna cut off their hands and heads, killed their horses and elephants and broke their chariots 8. 64. 16-17; (12) On the seventeenth day, at night (niśi 8. 1. 25), when Saṁjaya reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the death of Karṇa, he while remembering the past heroism of Karṇa mentioned that he had formerly defeated Śakas and many others and made them pay tribute (cakre balibhṛtaḥ purā) 8. 5. 18, 20 (reference to Karṇa's digvijaya at the time of Duryodhana's vaiṣṇavayajña 3. 241. 19, 32 (Vol. 4. App. I. 24. 28-34); (13) On the eighteenth day, Kṛpa with Śakas and Yavanas stood on the right side (dakṣiṇe pārśve) of the Sarvatobhadravyūha (9. 7. 19) of Kauravas 9. 7. 24; (14) At the end of the war, Saṁjaya mentioned Śakas among those who were killed in the war 9. 1. 26; Dhṛtarāṣṭra remembered that Śakas and others had joined his side not caring for death while fighting (madartham udyatāḥ sarve prāṇāṁs tyaktvā raṇe); Duryodhana boasted his ability to fight with Pāṇḍavas due to the support of Śakas 9. 2. 8, 21-22. 

  E.   Past event: Māndhātṛ once asked Indra how people like Śakas were to be made to follow Dharma and how kings like him should control them (kathaṁ dharmaṁ careyus te …madvidhaiś ca kathaṁ sthāpyāḥ); Indra thereupon told Māndhātṛ the duties of Dasyus (the term Dasyu apparently covered Śakas) 12. 65. 13, 15, 17-21. 

  F.   Future event: Śakas are mentioned among many kings who at the end of the Yuga (yugānte samanuprāpte) 3. 186. 30; yugānte 3. 186. 33; yugakṣaye 3. 186. 43, 48) would rule the earth the wrong way, would be sinful and would be given to tell lies (mithyānuśāsinaḥ pāpā mṛṣāvādaparāyaṇāḥ) 3. 186. 29-30.

  A.   Description: unfailing (amoghā) 3. 286. 14; 3. 294. 20, 21, 24, 29, 33; 7. 157. 7, 12, 16, 29; heavenly (divyā) 8. 5. 65; best, excellent (śreṣṭhā) 7. 154. 52; (uttamā) 7. 154. 55; (paramā) 7. 157. 6; (pravarā) 3. 294. 29; honoured (satkṛtā) 7. 154. 53; (pūjyamānā) 7. 122. 33; irresistible (anivāryā) 7. 158. 2; unbearable (asahyā) 7. 154. 52; 7. 158. 2; burning, shining (like a lightning) (prajvalantī) 7. 122. 33; (jvalantī) 7. 154. 57; (prajvalitā) 3. 294. 35; (pradīptā) 7. 154. 54; dīpyamānā 7. 148. 34; 7. 154. 57; (vidyutprabhā) 8. 5. 65; decorated with gold (kanakabhūṣaṇā) 8. 5. 65; victorious (vaijayantī) 7. 154. 52; the highway to victory (jayasya ca parāyaṇam) 7. 157. 6; killer of one opponent (when used by Karṇa) (ekaghnī) 7. 158. 2; destroyer of the body of the enemy (parakāyāpahantrī) 7. 154. 55; killer of many enemies (when used by Indra) (dviṣatāṁ hantrī) 8. 5. 65; (amitravinibarhiṇī) 3. 286. 14; (śatrusaṅghānāṁ ghātinīm) 3. 294. 21; having a terrible form (raudrarūpaṁ bibharti ca) 7. 148. 34. 

  B.   Exchanged by Indra for Karṇa's armour and ear-rings: God Sūrya advised Karṇa to obtain from Indra his unfailing Śakti in exchange for (niyamena) the armour (kavaca) and the ear-rings (kuṇḍalas) which Indra would ask Karṇa to part with 3. 286. 14-15; after receiving this hint, Karṇa longing for the Śakti waited for Vāsava (Indra) 3. 286. 20; when Indra came and begged Karṇa of his kavaca and kuṇḍalas, Karṇa asked Indra's unfailing Śakti in return 3. 294. 20-21; Indra agreed to part with his Śakti under the stipulation that although the Śakti, when used by Indra, would unfailingly kill Indra's enemies by hundreds and return to Indra's (user's) hand, when it reached Karṇa it would kill only one illustrious, roaring and tormenting enemy of Karṇa and return, not to Karṇa, but to Indra (seyaṁ tava karaṁ prāpya hatvaikaṁ ripum ūrjitam/garjantaṁ pratapantaṁ ca mām evaiṣyati sūtaja//) 3. 294. 23-25; the Śakti, as long as it was with Karṇa, would fail after killing one hero and would lose its quality of being unfailing (ekavīravadhe moghā) 7. 157. 1, 7; (amoghāyā vighātārtham) 7. 157. 12; Karṇa agreed to receive the Śakti on that condition for he feared danger in battle only from one enemy 3. 294. 26, 29; Indra also warned Karṇa not to use the Śakti when other missiles were available with him and when he was not in danger; if used negligently the Śakti would boomerang on Karṇa (vidyamāneṣu śastreṣu yady amoghām asaṁśaye/ pramatto mokṣyase cāpi tvayyevaiṣā patiṣyati//) 3. 294. 33; Karṇa vowed to Indra (satyam etad bravīmi te) that he would release the Vāsavī (Śakti) only when he was in great danger 3. 294. 34; Karṇa then received the burning Sakti in exchange of his kavaca and kuṇḍalas 3. 294. 35, 38; 8. 5. 65. 

  C.   What the Śakti meant to Karṇa: Karṇa had great confidence due to the Śakti (ayaṁ ca pratyayaḥ karṇe śaktyā) 7. 157. 31; when Vāsava (Indra) gave the Śakti to Karṇa, he (Karṇa) felt that Arjuna was as good as dead 7. 155. 21-22; with Śakti in Karṇa's hand, no one in the world dare oppose him 7. 155. 13; Karṇa had preserved the Śakti to kill Arjuna 7. 122. 33; 7. 148. 34; 7. 154. 53; the Śakti meant death for Arjuna 7. 157. 38; Duḥśāsana, Śakuni, Jayadratha and Duryodhana always counselled Karṇa not to use the Śakti against any one except Arjuna 7. 157. 32-34; (cf. 7. 157. 19-21 for the use of Śakti (not named) only against Arjuna or Kṛṣṇa); if on any occasion Karṇa's other missiles had failed and if he was pressed (pīḍitaḥ) by the circumstances, he would certainly have used his Vāsavī Śakti against Arjuna 7. 158. 54; hence Kṛṣṇa protected Arjuna particularly from the unfailing Śakti which, if released, would certainly have killed him like the lightning striking down a tree 7. 157. 16; according to Vyāsa too if Arjuna and Karṇa had clashed, the latter, after exhausting all other missiles, would have surely used Vāsavī against Arjuna 7. 158. 56; Kṛṣṇa was therefore always looking for a way to render the unfailing Śakti futile (amoghāṁ tāṁ kathaṁ śaktiṁ moghāṁ kuryām) 7. 157. 29; when the Śakti was diverted on Ghaṭotkaca, Karṇa, in the opinion of Kṛṣṇa, was as good as dead 7. 155. 12; when Karṇa was relieved of his Śakti, he became an ordinary human being (so 'dya mānuṣatāṁ prāpto vimuktaḥ śakradattayā 7. 155. 27), and Arjuna could dare attack him 8. 22. 33. 

  D.   Why the Śakti was not used against Arjuna: Both Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Sātyaki asked Saṁjaya and Kṛṣṇa respectively why the Śakti was not used by Karṇa against Arjuna 7. 157. 1; 7. 158. 2-3; 7. 157. 31; (1) according to Saṁjaya's reporting, Duryodhana, Śakuni, Duḥśāsana, and he himself urged Karṇa every night after the day's war to use his Śakti the next day against Arjuna or Kṛṣṇa (7. 157. 19-21), but that counsel was forgotten the next day during the fight due to the watchfulness of Kṛṣṇa (sā tu buddhiḥ kṛtāpy evaṁ jāgrati tridaśeśvare/aprameye hṛṣīkeśe yuddhakāle vyamuhyata) 7. 157. 27; Kṛṣṇa also never brought Arjuna face to face with Karṇa as long as the latter was equipped with Śakti; Kṛṣṇa managed to see that other warriors faced Karṇa 7. 157. 28-29; according to Saṁjaya, again, the previous night's counsel (7. 158. 4-5) was forgotten by Karṇa the next day due to the deities (unfavorable) to him and to the other heroes (on the side of the Kauravas), and thus it was primarily due to the working of the fate that Karṇa did not employ his Śakti against Arjuna or Kṛṣṇa to kill any one of them (tataḥ prabhātasamaye rājan karṇasya daivataiḥ/anyeṣāṁ caiva yodhānāṁ sā buddhir naśyate punaḥ//daivam eva paraṁ manye yat karṇo hastasaṁsthayā/na jaghāna raṇe pārthaṁ kṛṣṇaṁ vā devakīsutam// 7. 158. 6-7; also 8-9; (2) according to Vyāsa too it was due to fate (diṣṭyā) that Arjuna was not locked in a duel with Karṇa prior to the latter's being relieved of the Śakti 7. 158. 54; according to him Ghaṭotkaca was killed by Time using Vāsavī as his means (vāsavīṁ kāraṇaṁ kṛtvā kālenāpahato hy asau) 7. 158. 58; (3) according to Kṛṣṇa he deluded the mind of Karṇa and hence he did not use his Śakti against Arjuna (aham eva tu rādheyaṁ mohayāmi yudhāṁ vara 7. 157. 37; (4) according to Dhṛtarāṣṭra both fate and the intelligence of Kṛṣṇa came together to defeat the purpose of the Kauravas and hence the Vāsavī (Śakti) killed Ghaṭotkaca instead of Arjuna (daivenaiva hatā yūyaṁ svabuddhyā keśavasya ca/gatā hi vāsavī hatvā tṛṇabhūtaṁ ghaṭotkacam) 7. 158. 10. 

  E.   Use: (1) By Karṇa: All the Kuru warriors urged Karṇa to kill the demon Ghaṭotkaca by using the Śakti given to him by Vāsava and save the Kauravas and their warriors from destruction; hearing that call, Karṇa held the Śakti desiring to kill Ghaṭotkaca, that Śakti given to him by Śakra and which he had preserved for Arjuna for years; when the missile was released, Ghaṭotkaca, afraid, assumed a huge form of the foot of the Vindhya mountain and fled; the beings in the mid-region wailed at the sight of the Śakti; the released Śakti first burnt the māyā of Ghaṭotkaca, and then broke open deeply the chest of Ghaṭotkaca and went up in the sky, shining at night, to enter the spaces between the nakṣatras (ūrdhvaṁ yayau dīpyamānā niśāyāṁ nakṣatrāṇām antarāṇy āviśantī 7. 154. 57); Ghaṭotkaca, with his vitals pierced by the Śakti, was killed 7. 154. 48-59; 7. 156. 24; 7. 158. 10; 8. 5. 71; by asking Ghaṭotkaca to fight with Karṇa, Kṛṣṇa diverted the Śakti on him 7. 156. 27; 7. 157. (5), 6, 39; 7. 155. 12, 14; (Kṛṣṇa said that if Karṇa had not killed Ghaṭotkaca with his Śakti, he would have killed Ghaṭotkaca 7. 156. 25); (2) By Indra: When used by Indra while fighting with the Daityas, the Śakti, after killing his enemies by hundreds, returned to Indra's hand 3. 294. 24; 3. 286. 16 (killing of the enemies by hundreds and thousands). [See  Śakti^2-5 ]

*2nd word in left half of page p456  (+offset) in original book.Śabara  : m. (pl.): Name of a forest tribe. 

  A.   Location: (1) Listed by Saṁjaya among the northern Janapadas (also called Deśas 6. 10. 68) of the Bhāratavarṣa (ata ūrdhvaṁ janapadān nibodha) 6. 10. 37, 5; aṭavī śabarāś caiva 6. 10. 46 (Are Aṭavīśabaras living in the north different from the other Śabaras who lived in the south ? see the next); (2) Śabaras who lived in the south (dakṣiṇāpathajanmānaḥ) 12. 200. 39 (these are, however, not listed by Saṁjaya among the southern Janapadas of the Bhāratavarṣa 6. 10. 56-63ab). 

  B.   Origin: (1) Angered Nandinī, the cow of Vasiṣṭha, created Śabaras from her dung (asṛjat… śakṛtaḥ śabarān…krodhamūrcchitā) 1. 165. 35; this event is said to have occurred also on a different occasion; when Viśvāmitra's army destroyed the forest near Vasiṣṭha's āśrama, he angered, asked his cow to produce Śabaras; accordingly she produced them (kruddho…vasiṣṭhaḥ…/ sṛjasva śabarān ghorān iti svāṁ gām uvāca ha) 9. 39. 20; (2) Some Kṣatriyas are also said to have been degraded to the state of a vṛṣala due to their disregard of Brāhmaṇas (śabarabarbarāḥ//…tās tāḥ kṣatriyajātayaḥ/vṛṣalatvam anuprāptā brāhmaṇānām adarśanāt//) 13. 35. 17-18; elsewhere it is stated that the Kṣatriyas who killed Jamadagni became vṛṣala due to their transgressing the dharma of Kṣatriyas and their disregard of Brāhmaṇas (teṣāṁ (i. e. kṣatriyāṇām) …prajā vṛṣalatāṁ prāptā brāhmaṇānām adarśanāt//ta ete…puṇḍrāś ca śabaraiḥ saha/vṛṣalatvaṁ parigatā vyutthānāt kṣatradharmataḥ//) 14. 29. 15-16; (3) But at one place it is mentioned that Śabaras and others existed since the Tretāyuga (tretāprabhṛti vartante te janā… (i. e.

  F.   Past event: (1) King Dyumatsena once ruled the Śālvas until he became blind 3. 278. 7; after some years his subjects approached him in the forest to request him to rule over them once again (tataḥ prakṛtayaḥ sarvāḥ śālvebhyo 'bhyāgatā…) 3. 283. 3, 5.

*1st word in right half of page p575  (+offset) in original book.Śukra^1  : m.: Name of the planet Venus, also called  Bhārgava  (7. 143. 30). 

  A.   Description: lustrous (tejasvin) 12. 278. 5. 

  B.   History: (1) Yudhiṣṭhira once asked Bhīṣma how Uśanas of imperishable lustre became Śukra and how he acquired prosperity (kathaṁ cāpy uśanā prāpa śuktratvam amaradyutiḥ/ṛddhiṁ sa ca kathaṁ prāptaḥ) 12. 278. 4 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 289. 5 explains śukratvaṁ as śukrotpannatvam, cf. sa viniṣkramya śiśnena śukratvam abhipedivān 12. 278. 32); Yudhiṣṭhira also asked Bhīṣma why does Śukra not move through the middle of the sky (na yāti ca sa tejasvī madhyena nabhasaḥ katham) 12. 278. 5; 12. 278. 32 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 289. 5: tasya ākāśagatiḥ kutaḥ kuṇṭhitety arthaḥ/ saptarṣivad dvīrūpeṇa sthitasya śukrasya bhūsthamūrtiviṣayaka evāyaṁ praśno na bhacakrasthamūrtiviṣayaḥ tena yathā bhaumānāṁ vasiṣṭhādīnāṁ svarge 'pi gatir asti naivaṁ bhaumasya śukrasyāstīti gamyate/); (2) Parāśara told Janaka that Uśanas became Śukra by propitiating Devadeva (Śiva); and by praising Devī (Umā) he, covered with lustre, delights in the sky (gataḥ śukratvam uśanā devadevaprasādanāt/ devīṁ stutvā tu gagane modate tejasā vṛtaḥ) 12. 281. 14 (a reference to 12. 278. 13-37); (3) Planet Śukra is the son of Kavi (śukraḥ kavisuto grahaḥ) 1. 60. 40 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 66. 42: śukro grahatvād eva lokānāṁ prāṇayātrāyāṁ varṣāvarṣādikārye niyuktaḥ) 

  C.   Importance: (1) Śukra, along with other planets, visits the sabhā of Brahman 2. 11. 20; (2) finds place in the Daivatavaṁśa 13. 151. 12. 

  D.   Name of Sūrya: Śukra appears as the 23rd name in the list of the 108 names of Sūrya taught by Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 19. 

  E.   Auspicious: (1) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra heard that the planet Śukra and Sūrya both together were favourable to the sons of Kuntī for their victory in war he did not hope to win (yadāśrauṣaṁ śukrasūryau ca yuktau kaunteyānām anulomau jayāya…tadā nāsaṁse vijayāya saṁjaya//) 1. 1. 129; (2) Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that in wars, victory was on that side for which wind, Sūrya and the planet Śukra were favourable; if they all were simultaneously present, each time the former was stronger than the latter (yato vāyur yataḥ sūryo yataḥ śukras tato jayaḥ/pūrvaṁ pūrvaṁ jyāya eṣāṁ saṁnipāte yudhiṣṭhira 12. 101. 17. 

  F.   Bad effect: While Śukra is in conjunction with the two Proṣṭhapadās it has wealth (as Kubera, the lord of riches, also has); Śukra in that position takes away from men whatever they have earned according to their desires 5. 112. 3 (for citation and Nī.'s comm. see  Pūrvā Bhādrapadā ); (for Śukra as a great sage and perfect in yoga depriving also Kubera of his wealth see 12. 278. 7-9). 

  G.   Omens: Among the bad omens noticed by the Vyāsa before the war one was related to Śukra's ascending the Pūrva Proṣṭhapada and then, after going over to the Uttara Proṣṭhapada, both looking back at the Pūrva Proṣṭhapada 6. 3. 14 (for citation see  Uttarā Bhādrapadā ). 

  H.   Similes: (1) The battle between Drupada and Jayadratha, delightful to the spectators (īkṣitṛprītijananam), was like the one between Śukra and Aṅgāraka 6. 43. 54; (2) Droṇa and Arjuna met in battle like Budha and Śukra in the sky (nabhastale) 6. 97. 57; (3) The battle between Prativindhya and Duḥśāsana was like the one between Budha and Bhārgava (Śukra) in a cloudless sky (vyapetajalade vyomni) 7. 143. 30; (4) Arjuna, with Kṛṣṇa and Sātyaki by his side in the chariot, looked like the darknessdestroying Śaśin with Budha and Śukra 7. 60. 20. [For  Śukra  also see Section 1. 7]

 previous_page p887       next_page p889Śūra  : m. (pl): Name of a people. 

  A.   Location: Śūras lived probably in the north-west and were different from the Śūrasenas since they are mentioned along with Daradas, Bāhlīkas and others and since they are said to have brought tribute for the Rājasūya (see Epic event No. 1 below) and also because they are grouped with Yavanas (see 

  B.   below). 

  B.   Special characteristic: According to a certain Brāhmaṇa reporting to Dhṛtarāṣṭra in the assembly of Kurus (8. 30. 7, 58), Śūras, like Yavanas, had the special characteristic of being clever in knowing everything (even though what was to be conveyed was not expressed in so many words) (sarvajñā yavanā rājañ śūrāś caiva viśeṣataḥ) 8. 30. 80. 

  C.   Epic event: The Kṣatriyas among the Śūras, along with Vāyavyas and others, brought wealth in hundreds as tribute for the Rājasūya of Yudhiṣṭhira (āhārṣuḥ kṣatriyā vittaṁ śataśo 'jātaśatrave) 2. 48. 12, 16; (Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas, however, who like Śūrasenas, are sections of Yādavas, are reported to have not given tribute for the Rājasūya 2. 48. 42).

  C.   Characteristics: (1) There are only three peaks on this mountain; one of them is full of jewels, the other is golden and wonderful, and the third is full of all kinds of precious stones and is adorned with palatial mansions (śṛṅgāṇi vai śṛṅgavatas trīṇy eva manujādhipa/ekaṁ maṇimayaṁ tatra tathaikaṁ raukmam adbhutam//sarvaratnamayaṁ caikaṁ bhavanair upaśobhitam) 6. 9. 8-9; (2) The goddess Śāṇḍilī, who is self-luminous, always lives there (tatra svayaṁprabhā devī nityaṁ vasati śāṇḍilī) 6. 9. 9; (3) Manes haunt Śṛṅgavant (śṛṅgavāṁs tu mahārāja pitṝṇāṁ pratisaṁcaraḥ) 6. 7. 49.

*2nd word in left half of page p463  (+offset) in original book.Saṁśaptaka  : m. (pl.): A general term to designate the group of five Trigarta brothers and their followers who together took the oath to kill Arjuna; their army in general, which included besides Trigartas also Mālavas and many other Janapadas, is also referred to as Saṁśaptaka; sometimes Nārāyaṇas and Gopālas also figure in the context of Saṁśaptakas. 

  A.   Description: Heroic (vīra) 3. 240. 33; 7. 17. 30; 8. 12. 4; 8. 14. 18; brave (śūra) 8. 14. 5; 8. 40. 94; 8. 42. 3; tigers among men (naravyāghra) 7. 17. 2; skilled in the use of missiles (kṛtāstra) 6. 20. 15; fond of battles (yuddhaśaunḍa) 8. 31. 14; great chariot-fighters (māhāratha) 1. 1. 131; 7. 26. 10, 18; famous, widely known (prakhyāta) 3. 240. 22; (nāmalabdhānām viditānāṁ samantataḥ) 8. 40. 94. 

  B.   Epic events: (1) Saṁśaptakas took away Arjuna from the main battle-field; after Abhimanyu's death, Arjuna killed all the surviving Saṁśaptakas--these two chief points of the epic events mentioned while listing the contents of the Droṇaparvan in the Parvasaṁgrahaparvan 1. 2. 160, 163; (2) Dānavas informed Duryodhana who was taken to Rāsātala by a kṛtyā that the Saṁśaptakas were Daityas and Rākṣasas in hundreds and thousands appointed to kill Arjuna and they would kill him; then Duryodhana felt assured that (Karṇa and) the Saṁśaptakas were meant to kill Arjuna and that they were capable of accomplishing the task; the mind of the Saṁśaptakas was under the spell of Rākṣasas and, overcome by the qualities rajas and tamas, they were eager to kill Arjuna (sāṁśaptakāś ca te vīrā rākṣasāviṣṭacetasaḥ/rajastamobhyāṁ ākrāntāḥ phalgunasya vadhaiṣiṇaḥ//) 3. 240. 22, 30, 33; (3) Saṁjaya told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that in the ensuing war the five Kekaya brothers would take on the two chief Trigartas of the Saṁśaptakas (trigartānāṁ ca dvau mukhyau yau tau śaṁśaptakāv iti) 5. 56. 18; (4) An ayuta of Saṁśaptaka chariot-fighters were meant to fight with Arjuna resulting either in the death or victory of Arjuna; they followed Arjuna wherever he went (saṁśaptakānām ayutaṁ rathānāṁ mṛtyur jayo vārjunasyeti sṛṣṭāḥ/yenārjunas tena…prayātā vai te) 6. 20. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 20. 15; yena yatra tena tatra); (5) Śuśarman, king of Trigartas, and his five brothers Satyaratha, Satyadharman, Satyavarman, Satyeṣuḥ and Satyakarman together with their army of Trigartas, as well as Mālavas, Tuṇḍikeras, Mācellakas, Lalitthas, Madrakas and many other Janapadas took the oath (śapatha) to kill Arjuna 7. 16. 11, 15-21; the mode of oath, also called pratijñā, in which offerings were given in fire, described 7. 16. 22-37; in the description of the war, in the context of Saṁśaptakas, besides some of those groups of people mentioned above, also occur Nārāyaṇas, Gopālas (7. 17. 31; 7. 18. 7), and Yaudheyas (7. 18. 16); (6) On the twelfth day of the war, Droṇa planned a battle between Arjuna and the Saṁśaptaka troops and when Arjuna left the main battlefield to fight with them, he arranged his army in the Suparṇavyūha against Pāṇḍavas (vidhāya yogaṁ pārthena saṁśaptakagaṇaiḥ saha) 7. 19. 2-4; the Saṁśaptakas arranged their chariots on even ground in the vyūha called Candrārdha; they were delighted to see Arjuna approaching them for a fight; they roared loudly; Arjuna was surprised to find that they were delighted when actually they should have been grieved; or, he thought, perhaps, they were delighted because they would go to excellent worlds (after death) which were otherwise difficult to be obtained by bad people 7. 17. 1-6; hearing the sound of Devadatta conch blown by Arjuna, the army of Saṁśaptakas became motionless; regaining consciousness they started fighting with Arjuna by showering kaṅkapatrin arrows against him 7. 17. 9-11; the battle described in which Subāhu, Sudharman and Sudhanvan also participated 7. 17. 12-22; at the death of Sudhanvan, his followers, afraid, ran towards the army of Duryodhana 7. 17. 23; Suśarman, king of Trigartas, rebuked those who fled; he reminded them of their terrific oaths (śaptvā tu śapathān ghorān); the troops of Saṁśaptakas then blew their conches and returned to fight till death (mṛtyuṁ kṛtvā nivartanam//) 7. 17. 27-31; seeing that the troops of Saṁśaptakas were returning Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot towards them; he was determined to kill them 7. 18. 1-3; the Vāyavyāstra released by Arjuna to ward off the arrows of the opponents also blew away a large number of Saṁśaptakas along with their chariots, horses, elephants and weapons; Arjuna killed a large number of Saṁśaptakas; their condition as well as the condition of the battle-field described 7. 18. 22-37; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya how Arjuna dealt with the army of Saṁśaptakas (saṁśaptakabalaṁ prati) and how did they encounter him 7. 25. 2; Arjuna left Saṁśaptakas for a while to fight with Bhagadatta who was routing the Pāṇḍava army; fourteen thousand Saṁśaptakas followed him and challenged him; Arjuna hesitated for a while whether to fight with Saṁśaptakas or go to help Yudhiṣṭhira; ultimately he decided to kill Saṁśaptakas (first) (abhavad bhuyasī buddhiḥ saṁśaptakavadhe sthirā); the great Saṁśaptaka chariot-fighters (saṁśaptakamahārathāḥ) discharged numerous smooth arrows (śatasahasrāṇi śarāṇāṁ nataparvaṇāṁ) on Arjuna with the result that, covered with the arrows, neither Arjuna, nor Kṛṣṇa, nor his horses, nor chariot, could be seen; when Kṛṣṇa was deluded (moham anuprāptaḥ… janārdanaḥ) Arjuna killed Saṁśaptakas with Vajrāstra 7. 26. 10, 12-14, 18-20; the condition of Saṁśaptakas described 7. 26. 21-27; having killed Saṁśaptakas Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot towards Bhagadatta 7. 26. 29; but Suśarman and his Saṁśaptaka brothers followed Arjuna challenging him for a fight (yuddhārthī pṛṣthato 'nvayāt//…suśarmāhvayate 'cyuta//); Arjuna therefore was again in doubt-whether to kill Saṁśaptakas first or to go to the aid of his side 7. 27. 2-5; he asked Kṛṣṇa to turn back and started fighting with Suśarman; his battle with Saṁśaptaka brothers described in which Suśarman swooned 7. 27. 7-10; later, Arjuna continued to kill the surviving Saṁśaptakas and Nārāyaṇas on the southern side of the army (dakṣiṇena tu senāyāḥ kurute kadanaṁ bali/saṁśaptakāvaśeṣasya nārāyaṇabalasya ca//) 7. 30. 29; after killing the Saṁśaptakas, Arjuna returned to attack Droṇa and the Kaurava army 7. 31. 41-44; (7) On the thirteenth day, when Droṇa reitereted the necessity of removing Arjuna from the main battle, Saṁśaptakas renewed their challenge to Arjuna and took him away to the south of the battlefield (āhvayann arjunaṁ saṁkhye dakṣiṇām abhito diśam) 7. 32. 15; towards the end of the day, Arjuna proceeded towards his camp after killing Saṁśaptakas 7. 50. 1-3; Yudhiṣṭhira, grieved over the death of Abhimanyu, told Arjuna that after he left to fight with the Saṁśaptaka army, Droṇa made a serious attempt to capture him 7. 51. 1; (8) On the fourteenth day, at the instance of Duryodhana, the army of Kauravas, along with Saṁśaptakas, returned to fight with Sātyaki with great determination (te punaḥ saṁnyavartanta kṛtvā saṁśaptakān mithaḥ) 7. 97. 12; when Duḥśāsana was wounded by Sātyaki, Duryodhana asked Trigartas to fight with Sātyaki; Saṁśaptakas again made a determined effort to attack Sātyaki; Sātyaki killed their five hundred chief warriors, showering arrows on them, at the head of the army (agrānīke vyapothayat) 7. 99. 3-7; their condition described 7. 99. 8-11; ultimately they retreated in the direction of Droṇa 7. 99. 12; (9) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra was told that on the sixteenth day, angry Arjuna attacked the Saṁśaptaka troops (saṁśaptakagaṇān 8. 9. 8) he wished to know the details of the fight between Saṁśaptakas and Arjuna; Arjuna entered the large ocean-like troops of Saṁśaptakas (saṁśaptakagaṇaṁ…arṇavasaṁnibham) and agitated it (vyakṣobhayat); the fight in which Arjuna cut off the hands and heads of his opponents with sharp arrows and killed elephants and horses along with their riders as well as chariot-fighters was hairraising (lomaharṣaṇam) 8. 12. 1, 3-13; at that point Aśvatthāman challenged Arjuna; hence he asked Kṛṣṇa whether he should continue killing Saṁśaptakas or accept the challenge of Aśvatthāman: Kṛṣṇa drove him to Aśvatthāman 8. 12. 21-22; after fighting with Aśvatthāman, Arjuna returned to Saṁśaptaka horse-riders, chariotfighters, elephant-riders and foot-soldiers (tataḥ saṁśaptakān bhūyaḥ sāśvasūtarathadvipān/dhvajapattigaṇān) 8. 12. 36; battle described in which Arjuna killed all kinds of his opponents (saṁśaptakamahārṇavam/ vyaśoṣayata duḥśoṣam…) and returned to fight with Aśvatthāman 8. 12. 37-43, 47; after fighting for a while with him, Arjuna came back to Saṁśaptakas; he cut off the hands, heads, weapons etc. of the opponents who did not turn back (aparāṅmukhānām) 8. 12. 54-58; after Arjuna's one more encounter with Aśvatthāman in which the latter was removed from the battle by his horses, Arjuna continued his battle with Saṁśaptakas 8. 12. 70-71; when there was loud noise to the north of the battle-field (8. 13. 1), Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to go there and first fight with Māgadha Daṇḍadhāra; he could later kill the Saṁśaptakas 8. 13. 4; accordingly, Arjuna first killed Daṇḍadhāra and his elephant and came back to Saṁśaptakas 8. 13. 25; in the battle that followed, Arjuna killed many Saṁśaptakas, while Kṛṣṇa drove his chariot in various roundabout ways (vakrānuvakragamanāt) 8. 14. 1; the battle described 8. 14. 2-21; at that moment Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna not to while away his time with Saṁśaptakas; he should kill them without loss of time and hasten to kill Karṇa (kiṁ krīḍase 'nagha/saṁśaptakān pramathyaitāṁs tataḥ karṇavadhe tvara); Arjuna agreed and killed quickly the remaining Saṁśaptakas (kṣipraṁ śiṣṭān saṁśaptakāṁs tadā/ākṣipya śastreṇa balād… avadhīt) 8. 14. 22-23; Trigartas, along with Śālvas, Saṁśaptakas, and Nārāyaṇas, led by the king of Trigartas and his brothers, attacked Arjuna 8. 19. 2-4; the battle, in which Saṁśaptakas were killed by hundreds and thousands (śataśo 'tha sahasraśaḥ 8. 19. 19) and at one stage they surrounded Arjuna and showered him with weapons, described 8. 19. 5-34; in the end almost the entire Saṁśaptaka army turned back and did not stay to face Arjuna (prāyaśo vimukhaṁ sarvaṁ nāvatiṣṭhata saṁyuge); Arjuna thus won victory over many Saṁśaptaka troops (saṁśaptakagaṇān bahūn) 8. 19. 34-35; (10) On the seventeenth day, thirtyfour thausand chariot-fighters of Śaṁśaptakas determined to fight to the end stood on the left side of the Bārhaspatyavyūha of Kauravas (catustriṁśatsahasrāṇi rathānām anivartinām/saṁśaptakā… vāmaṁ pārśvam apālayan…bārhaspatyaḥ …mahāvyūhaḥ) 8. 31. 14, 26; Śalya drew attention of Karṇa to Saṁśaptakas who had challenged Arjuna; in response, they were being attacked and killed by Arjuna; angered Saṁśaptakas covered him on all sides making Arjuna invisible (saṁśaptakaiḥ kruddhaiḥ…channaḥ pārtho na dṛśyate) 8. 31. 56-57; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya to describe to him the battle between Arjuna and Saṁśaptakas; Saṁjaya told him that when the armies were arrayed (atha vyūḍheṣv anīkeṣu), Arjuna attacked Saṁśaptakas; wishing to kill Arjuna and determined to win victory not minding death (vijaye kṛtasaṁkalpā mṛtyuṁ kṛtvā nivartanam) they rushed towards Arjuna; their army consisted of many horses, elephants, chariotfighters and foot-soldiers; a fierce battle then took place; Arjuna cut off their hands, holding different weapons, as well as their heads; thinking Arjuna's chariot was drowned in the large army, Saṁśaptakas delightfully raised a roar (tasmin sainye mahāvarte…/nimagnaṁ taṁ rathaṁ matvā neduḥ saṁśaptakā mudā/) 8. 32. 1-13; at the site where Arjuna was killing Saṁśaptakas a loud sound of Gāṇḍīva was heard; very much angered Saṁśaptakas, coveting victory (jayagṛddhāḥ pramanyavaḥ) showered arrows on Arjuna; Arjuna braved their attack and reached Suśarman; when Arjuna started showering arrows on Suśarman, Saṁśaptakas responded the same way; hearing the roar of the monkey on Arjuna's chariot, the army of Saṁśaptakas was much terrified and became motionless; regaining consciousness, the warriors showered arrows on Arjuna and covered his chariot; they held firmly the horses, the wheels and the shaft of Arjuna's chariot and roared loudly (te hayān rathacakre ca ratheṣāś cāpi bhārata/nigṛhya balavat); some mounted on Arjuna's chariot and held him and Kṛṣṇa; shaking his hands Kṛṣṇa felled them down; Arjuna saw Saṁśaptaka great chariot-fighters encircling him and holding his chariot and Kṛṣṇa; he felled many of them down who had mounted the chariot and other foot-soldiers who were close to him by shooting arrows which went short distances (apātayat/āsannāṁś ca tato yodhāñ śarair āsannayodhibhiḥ); he made the rest run away; Arjuna pointed out to Kṛṣṇa that he had killed thousands of Saṁśaptakas who had achieved the difficult task of checking his chariot (kurvāṇān dāruṇaṁ karma…rathabandhaṁ imaṁ/ ghoraṁ); Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa blew Devadatta and Pāñcajanya conches respy.; hearing that sound, the Saṁśaptaka army shook and became very much afraid (saṁcacāla…vitrastā cābhavad bhṛśam); Arjuna then bound their feet by releasing nāgāstra; he killed them in that condition; when they were being killed, they gave up fighting with Arjuna and threw down their weapons; then Suśarman released them from their bonds by using sauparṇāstra; once free, they showered arrows and weapons on Arjuna (sasṛjur bāṇasaṁghāṁś ca śastrasaṁghāṁś ca); Arjuna cut off the missiles with arrows and killed many elephants, horses and chariot-fighters by using aindrāstra; the troops of Saṁśaptakas and Nārāyaṇas were then very much afraid; no one was able to fight back Arjuna (na hi kaścit pumāṁs tatra yo 'rjunaṁ pratyavidhyata); Arjuna then killed an ayuta of the opposing warriors; fourteen thousand (foot) warriors, an ayuta of chariotfighters, and three thousand elephantriders of Saṁśaptakas who survived (yāni śiṣṭāni) once again surrounded Arjuna determined either to return with victory or die (martavayam iti niścitya jayaṁ vāpi nivartanam); a fierce fighting then was fought between them and Arjuna (8. 37. 1-38); Arjuna destroyed many Saṁśaptakas; their Kṣatriyas, tormented by him, were killed (te kṣatriyā dahyamānās… jagmur vināśam) 8. 40. 5-61 after killing many Saṁśaptaka troops (nihatya…saṁśaptakagaṇān bahūn), Arjuna pointed out to Kṛṣṇa the great Saṁśaptaka chariotfighters who along with their troops ran away as they were unable to resist his arrows (dhāvanti sagaṇāḥ saṁśaptakamahārathāḥ/apārayanto madbāṇān) 8. 40. 7880; Duryodhana again incited Saṁśaptakas to face Arjuna; then a thousand chariotfighters, three hundred elephant-riders, fourteen thousand horse-riders and two hundred thousand archers turned towards Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna covering them with arrows; but Arjuna killed ten thousand Saṁśaptakas 8. 40. 92-99; thus Arjuna completely destroyed (kṛtsnena vyadhamat) the Saṁśaptakas 8. 40. 130; when the armies of Kurus and Sṛñjayas met again only a few Saṁśaptakas had surs vived (saṁśaptakeṣu…kiṁcicchiṣṭeṣu); Arjuna, after defeating Aśvatthāman (8. 42. 51), asked Kṛṣṇa to take him to Saṁśaptakas since fighting with them was his main task (kāryam etat paraṁ mama) 8. 42. 3, 56; Arjuna killed the remaining Saṁśaptaka troops with sharp arrows with the result that they became the guests of Indra and became free from grief as they were happy (śakrasyātithitām gatvā viśokā hy abhavan mudā) 8. 43. 76-77; when Arjuna told Bhīma that he could not leave the battlefield (to go to enquire about Yudhiṣṭhira) without killing Saṁśaptakas who faced him, Bhīma assured him that he himself would fight with the Saṁśaptakas 8. 45. 63-64; Arjuna while explaining to Yudhiṣṭhira why he had not yet killed Karṇa told him that during his fight with Saṁśaptakas, Aśvatthāman had unexpectedly intervened (to distract him) 8. 47. 2; later, while boasting about his heroic deeds Arjuna mentioned that he had killed almost all Saṁśaptakas and only a few of them had survived (saṁśaptakānāṁ kiṁcid evāvaśiṣṭam) 8. 49. 96; at one stage, Duḥśāsana along with the fully equipped army of Saṁśaptakas (pṛtanā samṛddhā) attacked Bhīma 8. 53. 9; when Arjuna was proceeding towards Karṇa, Saṁśaptaka chariot-fighters attacked him showering arrows; Arjuna killed many of them along with their charioteers, and cut off their bows and banners with sharp arrows; they all fell down from their chariots 8. 59. 3-5; (11) On the seventeenth day, at night, when Saṁjaya reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the death of Karṇa (8. 1. 25), he (Dhṛtarāṣṭra), while recalling some of the major events of war, mentioned the killing of the Saṁśaptaka army by Arjuna 8. 1. 41; in reply to Dhṛtarāṣṭra's question who of the Kurus were still alive and who dead (ke nu jīvanti ke mṛtāḥ) 8. 4. 3, Saṁjaya mentioned Saṁśaptaka troops (saṁśaptakagaṇāś ca ye) among those who were killed by Arjuna 8. 4. 38; (12) On the eighteenth day, Arjuna speedily rushed towards Kṛtavarman and Saṁśaptaka troops which were posted on the left side of the Sarvatobhadravyūha of Kauravas 9. 7. 30, 19, 24 (where Saṁśaptakas are designated as Trigartas); Arjuna, having killed Saṁśaptakas in battle (hatvā saṁśaptakān raṇe) rushed towards, the army of Kauravas 9. 9. 59; as the day advanced (madhyaṁdinagate sūrye), Aśvatthāman, helped by Saṁśaptakas (saṁśaptakavṛto raṇe), fought with Arjuna; the battle was terrific in which a large number of warriors were killed (tatra yuddhaṁ mahac cāsīt…yamarāṣṭravivardhanam) 9. 13. 42-43; (vimardas tu mahān āsīt) 9. 13. 45; (13) On the nineteenth day, after the war was over, Saṁjaya, having returned early in the morning from the camp (tataḥ pūrvāhṇasamaye śibirād etya saṁjayaḥ 9. 1. 14), while reporting to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the war-events mentioned Saṁśaptakas among those who were killed in war 9. 1. 26; Dhṛtarāṣṭra lamenting the loss of life in war mentioned that many Saṁśaptakas were killed (saṁśaptakāś ca bahavaḥ (nihatāḥ)) 9. 2. 34; (14) Kṛṣṇa, while giving an account of war to Vasudeva, mentioned that before the fall of Abhimanyu, Saṁśaptakas had challenged Arjuna for a battle and took him away from the main scene (samāhūte tu saṁgrāme pārthe saṁśaptakais tadā) 14. 60. 19. 

  C.   Arjuna is described as the killer of Saṁśaptakas saṁśaptakaniṣūdana 14. 73. 32, saṁśaptakanihantṛ 14. 76. 9. [See  Trigarta ]

*2nd word in left half of page p152  (+offset) in original book.Sāman  : nt. (mostly plural): Stands for the Sāmaveda, or a hymn or stanzas of that Veda (in this sense it often occurs along with ṛc and yajus); a melody in which the stanzas of the Sāmaveda are sung. 

  A.   Relationship with Bhagāvān: Bhagavān told Arjuna that those who knew the Veda called him the Sāmaveda of a thousand branches (māṁ pracakṣate/sahasraśākhaṁ yat sāma ye vai vedavido janāḥ) 12. 330. 32; in the stanzas of the Sāmaveda, as in the other three Vedas and many other texts, many names of Bhagavān have been enumerated by the great sages (ṛgvede sayajurvede tathaivātharvasāmasu/…bahūni mama nāmāni kīrtitāni maharṣibhiḥ) 12. 328. 8. 

  B.   Singing of sāman as daily routine: The āśrama of Dadhīca on the other bank of Sarasvatī hummed with the sound of bees as with the chantings of sāman- singers (ṣaṭpadodgītaninadair vighuṣṭṁ sāmagair iva) 3. 98. 13; on the Gandhamādana mountain the Pāṇḍavas could hear the sound of the songs and of the clapping of hands (by the Gandharvas and the Kiṁpuruṣas) which sounded like the melody of the sāman chants (gītānāṁ talatālānāṁ yathā sāmnāṁ ca nisvanaḥ) 3. 155. 84; the precincts of the āśrama of Upamanyu resounded with the auspicious melodies of sāman-singers (śubhaiḥ sāmagānāṁ ca vīra) 13. 14. 35. 

  C.   Employment in sacrifices: In the Rājasūya of Yudhiṣṭhira the six fires were piled up with the chanting of sāman by those who had observed the vows (sāmnā ṣaḍagnayo yasmiṁś cīyante saṁśitavrataiḥ) 2. 12. 13; in this sacrifice Susāman, the chief of the Dhanaṁjayas, acted as the chanter of the sāmans 2. 30. 34 (dhanaṁjayānāṁ ṛṣabhaḥ susāmā sāmago 'bhavat/) Nī. on Bom. Ed. 2. 33. 34: dhanaṁjayānāṁ dhanaṁjayagotrāṇāṁ madhye śreṣṭhaḥ susāmā nāma āṅgirasaḥ); in the sacrifice of Janaka the excellent Ukthya sāman was sung 3. 134. 36; Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that in a sacrifice the sāman- singers praise employing the Rathantara melody (rathantare sāmagāś ca stuvanti) 13. 143. 15; Ṛṣi Gṛtsamada told Yudhiṣṭhira that once, when Indra's long sacrificial session lasting for a thousand years was in progress, Vasiṣṭha, the son of Manu Cākṣuṣa, found fault the way Gṛtsamada was singing the Rathantara chant; Vasiṣṭha asked Gṛtsamada to set his jubilation aside and again think over what he had done (rathantaraṁ dvijaśreṣṭha na samyag iti vartate/samīkṣasva punar buddhyā harṣaṁ tyaktvā dvijottama); (he charged Gṛtsamada that by his incorrect singing he had committed a sin which would not carry the sacrifice to the gods; for this fault Gṛtsamada was cursed to be a deer) 13. 18. 15-17; Vālmīki told Yudhiṣṭhira that in a certain dispute regarding sāman (-chanting) the sages pronounced the judgement that Vasiṣṭha had incurred the sin of killing a Brāhmaṇa and he was instantly seized by that sin (vīvāde sāmni munibhir brahmaghno vai bhavān iti/uktaḥ kṣaṇena cāviṣṭas tenādharmeṇa bhārata) 13. 18. 7. Trita, when he wanted to offer a sacrifice in the well, thought of ṛcs, yajuses and sāmans for using them in the rites 9. 35. 33; in the metaphorical sacrifice (saṁgrāmayajña 12. 99. 12) performed by a warrior (i. e. in a war) the words ‘cut, break’ uttered by the fighters in a war serve the purpose of the sāmans chanted by the sāman- singers in the abode of Yama (cf. the next section 

  D.  ) (chindhi bhindhīti yasyaitac chrūyate vāhinīmukhe/sāmāni sāmagās tasya gāyanti yamasādane) 12. 99. 22; sāmans were sung when formerly animals were bound for god Nārāyaṇa--this is mentioned in the ṛcs recited by those who know Nārāyaṇa and these are cited as an instance (ṛcaś cāpy atra śaṁsanti nārāyaṇavido janāḥ nārāyanāya devāya yad abdahnan paśūn purā// tatra sāmāni gāyanti tāni cāhur nidarśanam//) 14. 25. 16-17 (see however Nī. cited under ṛc p. 175. 2 above). 

  D.   Employment in funeral rites: When the Pāṇḍavas set out for the forest Dhaumya, their Purohita, accompanied them chanting on the way the terrible sāmans addressed to Yama and holding in his hand kuśa grass directed towards the Nairṛtya direction (dhaumyo yāmyāni sāmāni raudrāṇi ca viśāṁ pate/ gāyan gacchati mārgeṣu kuśān ādāya pāṇinā//) 2. 71. 7 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 2. 80. 7: yāmyāni yamadaivatyāni); (kṛtvā tu nairṛtān darbhān dhīro dhaumyaḥ purohitaḥ/sāmāni gāyan yāmyāni purato yāti bhārata) 2. 71. 21 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 2. 80. 22: nairṛtān nirṛtikoṇagān); he thereby wanted to indicate that when the Bhāratas will be killed in the war the priests of the Kurus will similarly chant the sāmans (addressed to Yama) 2. 71. 22; at the cremation of Droṇa the sāman-singers sang three sāmans when his body was placed on the funeral pyre (droṇam ādhāya gāyanti trīṇi sāmāni sāmagāḥ) 11. 23. 38; when the pyre was lit, others followed them reciting the three sāmans in subdued voices (see Cr. Ed. Vol. 12. p. 119 note on 11. 23. 41) (sāmabhis tribhir antaḥsthair anuśaṁsanti cāpare/agnāv agnim ivādhāya droṇaṁ hutvā hutāśane) 11. 23. 41; sāmans were sung at the Pitṛmedha rites of some of those fallen in the war; due to the sound of the sāmans and the ṛcs, as also due to the lamentations of women, all beings were stupefied during the night (pitṛmedhāś ca keṣāṁcid avartanta mahātmanām/ sāmabhiś cāpy agāyanta…// sāmnāṁ ṛcāṁ ca nādena strīṇāṁ ca ruditasvanaiḥ/kaśmalaṁ sarvabhūtānāṁ niśāyām samapadyata) 11. 26. 39-40; at the Pitṛmedha rites of Bhīṣma the sāman-singers sang the chants 13. 154. 12; during the Pitṛmedha rites, at the cremation of Vasudeva, when the funeral pyre was lit there was a loud sound produced by the sāman-singers (sāmagānāṁ ca nirghoṣaḥ) 16. 8. 23, 25-26. 

  E.   Use in the praise of deities: (1) Indra: Arjuna saw Indra praised by excellent dvijas with praises consisting of ṛcs, yajuses and sāmans 3. 44. 18; when Arjuna and Indra sat on the same throne, Gandharvas led by Tumburu, skilled in songs and chants, sang gāthās in very agreeable melody (tatra sma gāthā gāyanti sāmnā paramavalgunā/gandharvās tumburuśreṣṭhāḥ kuśalā gītasāmasu) 3. 44. 28; (2) Kubera: On the Gandhamādana mountain the sound of sāman- singing by Tumburu, who waits on Dhanada (Kubera) was heard on the junctions of the four changes of the moon (parvasadhiṣu) 3. 156. 28; (3) Śiva: Upamanyu in his praise of Śiva said that the god was sung with chants by the sāman-singers (sāmabhir yaṁ ca gāyanti sāmagāḥ śuddhabuddhayaḥ) 13. 16. 49; Śatakratu (Indra) and Viṣṇu (who are the two sons of Aditi), and god Brahman sing the Rathantara melody near Bhava (Śiva) (śatakratus ca bhagavān viṣṇuś cāditinandanau/ brahmā rathantaraṁ sāma īrayanti bhāvāntike) 13. 15. 16; (however, the Editor's note, Cr. Ed. Vol. 17, p. 1061 on 13. 15. 16, says: aditinandanau = Mitra and Varuṇa ?) (4) Deity not named: in the south, in the bowers of Mandara mountain and in the houses of the Viprarṣis, the Gandharvas sing enchanting gāthās sung in different melodies (gandharvā gānti gāthā vai cittabuddhiharā dvija/ atra sāmāni gāthābhiḥ śrutvā gītāni//) 5. 107. 9-10. 

  F.   Importance: While describing his vibhūtis, Bhagavān told Arjuna that he was the Bṛhatsāman chant among the melodies (bṛhatsām tathā sāmnām) 6. 32. 35; Bhīṣma praised Kṛṣṇa-Nārāyaṇa, who is sung in sāmans that are true, as one whose actions are true and who is truth (yaṁ… gṛṇanti satyakarmāṇaṁ satyaṁ satyeṣu sāmasu) 12. 47. 16 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 47. 26: gṛṇanti dhyāyanti satyam abādhitaṁ satyeṣu abādhitārtheṣu sāmasu jyeṣṭhasāmādiṣu). 

  G.   Personfication: The Sāmans along with the Yajuses and the Ṛgveda, in bodily form, attended the sacrifice of Mahādeva (Śiva) who had assumed the form of Varuṇa (mūrtimanti ca sāmāni yajūṁṣi ca sahasraśḥ/ṛgvedaś cāgamat tatra) 13. 85. 4, (devasya mahatas tāta vāruṇīṁ bibhratas tanum) 13. 85. 2, (ājagmuḥ…yajñaṁ paśupateḥ prītā varuṇasya mahātmanaḥ) 13. 85. 7-8. 

  H.   Mystic interpretation: The Yakṣa asked Yudhiṣṭhira: “What is the one sāman suited for sacrifice ?” Yudhiṣṭhira replied: “Prāṇa is the one sāman suited for sacrifice” (kim ekam yajñiyaṁ sāma) 3. 297. 34, (prāṇo vai yajñiyaṁ sāma) 3. 297. 35; Bhīṣma declared to Yudhiṣṭhira: There was but one sāman (ekaṁ sāma) 12. 60. 45 (Nī. on 12. 60 47: akāro vai sarvā vāk saiṣā sparśoṣmabhir vyajyamānā bhavī nānārūpā bhavatīti śruter ekaṁ akārarūpam eva akṣaraṁ yathā sāmādirūpaṁ) 

  I.   Relationship with Yugas: According to Hanūmant there were neither sāmans, yajuses nor ṛcs in the Kṛtayuga (nāsan kṛtayuge tāta…na sāmayajuṛgvarṇāḥ) 3. 148. 12-13 (See Nīlakaṇṭha on this passage cited under Yajus p. 207. 1; for such other information common to ṛcs and yajuses see Ṛc, especially 3. 27. 3; 5. 43. 1-3; 5. 44. 21; 6. 31. 17; 12. 52. 22; 12. 60. 42; 12. 194. 8; 12. 199. 1618; 12. 224. 63; 12. 227. 1; 12. 230. 8; 12. 243. 2; 12. 260. 26, 36; 12. 297. 15; 12. 322. 37).

*1st word in right half of page p905  (+offset) in original book.Sāvitrī^1  : f.: Name of a mantra (ṚV, 3. 62. 10) so called because it is related to god Savitṛ; also called Gāyatrī (3. 83. 27: 6. 5. 18-19) because the mantra is composed in the Gāyatrī metre. 

  A.   Description: holy (puṇyā) 6. 5. 18; best (uttamā) 13. 145. 27; having all qualities (sarvaguṇānvitā) 6. 5. 18; enabling the reciter to get over difficult situations (durgataraṇī) 2. 11. 25; highly honoured in the worlds (lokasaṁmatā) 6. 5. 18. 

  B.   Importance and significance: Sāvitrī was considered to be the beginning of all sciences (ādir iṣyate/sāvitrī sarvavidyānām) 14. 44. 4-5; the nineteen classes of beings (7 grāmya paśus, 7 āraṇya paśus, 5 udbhijjas) and the five mahābhūtas, which make a total of twenty-four are identified with (the twenty-four syllables of) the Gāyatrī (eṣāṁ viṁśatir ekonā mahābhūteṣu pañcasu/caturviṁśatir uddiṣṭā gāyatrī lokasaṁmatā//) 6. 5. 15-18. 

  C.   Its close assocication with the Vedas used for a simile: As the Sāvitrī mantra does not forsake the Vedas, so did Yājñasenī (Draupadī) not forsake the Pāṇḍavas 3. 80. 4. 

  D.   Relationship with deities: (1) Savitṛ: Sāvitrī was (first) pronounced in the east by god Savitṛ to the brahmavādins 5. 106. 10; 3. 110. 5 (? sāvitrīṁ savitā yathā (dadau)); (2) Nārāyaṇa: On the Śveta Dvīpa, Nārada saw oṁkāra, followed by Sāvitrī, coming out of the mouth of Nārāyaṇa 12. 326. 7; (3) Śiva: when Rudra got ready to destroy the Tripuras he made the Vedas his bow and the Sāvitrī mantra his bow-string 13 145. 27; 

  E.   Personification: (1) Sāvitrī, in bodily form, present in the Sabhā of Brahmadeva 2. 11. 25; Sāvitrī, along with the Vedas and the Upaniṣads attended the sacrifice of Śiva when he had assumed the form of Varuṇa 13. 85. 6. 

  F.   Uses: (1) In śrāddha: One should attentively recite the Sāvitrī prayer at each oblation given to the manes at the śrāddha (brūyāc chrāddhe ca sāvitrīṁ piṇḍe piṇḍe samāhitaḥ) 13. 92. 14; (cf. Śāṅkh Gṛ. Sū. 4. 1. 8 for a slightly different use: bhuñjāneṣu mahāvyāhṛtīḥ sāvitrīm madhuvātīyāḥ pitṛdevatyāḥ pāvamānīś ca japet); (2) for use as a test (?): If a person born of a mixture of castes recites Gāyatrī at the renowned tīrtha called Gāyatryāḥ sthānam it sounds like a gāthā (a non-Vedic stanza) or an ordinary song. This was a direct proof available for a Brāhmaṇa to prove that he was not of mixed origin (nidarśanaṁ ca pratyakṣaṁ brāhmaṇānāṁ narādhipa/gāyatrīṁ paṭhate yas tu yonisaṁkarajas tathā/gāthā vā gītikā vāpi tasya saṁpadyate nṛpa// Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 3. 85. 29: nidarśānam udāharaṇam); (3) As a benediction: Jāmbavatī invoked Sāvitrī mantra for the protection of Kṛṣṇa when he set out for the Himavant to meet Śiva (sāvitrī brahmavidyā ca ṛtavo vatsarāḥ kṣapāḥ/…rakṣantu sarvatra gataṁ tvām yādava sukhāvaham// 13. 14. 22-23). 

  G.   Qualifications and rewards obtained by its knowledge and recitation: Brāhmaṇas who know Sāvitrī, so also the one who recites Sāvitrī three times a day, are worthy of being invited for a śrāddha (sāvitrījñāḥ kriyāvantas te rājan ketanakṣamāḥ) 13. 24. 25, (sāvitrīṁ japate yas tu trikālam…sa rājan ketanakṣamaḥ) 13. 24. 28; one who recites Sāvitrī on a sacred spot, eating limited food, not injuring others, alert (? amandakaḥ), not talking to any one is freed of all sins 12. 36. 33 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 35. 37: manda iva mandakaḥ rāgadveṣamānāpamānaśūnyaḥ); one who knows the real nature of Gāyatrī (i. e. the identification of its 24 syllables with 19 kinds of beings and 5 mahābhūtas) is never deprived of the world due to him (ya etāṁ veda gāyatrīṁ… tattvena bharataśreṣṭha sa lokān na praṇaśyati) 6. 5. 19. [See  Sāvitrī^2, Bhāratasāvitrī ]

(5) On the second day of war, Sindhu warriors and Sauvīras (sindhusauvīrāḥ), led by Śakuni, protected Droṇa who was behind Bhīṣma in the Mahāvyūha of Kauravas 6. 47. 10, 14; (6) On the third day, Sindhu warriors and Sauvīras (sindhusauvīrāḥ) were posted at the ‘neck’ position (grivāyām) of the Garuḍavyūha of Kauravas 6. 52. 2-3, 5; (7) On the eighth dav, Irāvān, son of Arjuna, attacked the Kaurava army with horses of different countries some of them being those from the Sindhu country (vājinām/ …sindhujānāṁ ca sarvaśaḥ); the horses were swift like wind (hayair vātajavair…) 6. 86. 3, 5-6; (8) On the thirteeenth day, Arjuna assured Kṛṣṇa that he would kill the next day the Saindhava warriors along with their kings (mayā sarājakā bāṇair nunnā naṁkṣyanti saindhavāḥ) 7. 53. 48; (9) On the fourteenth day, Yudhiṣṭhira pointed out to Sātyaki that Arjuna, proceeding towards Jayadratha, was encircled by the Sindhu warriors and Sauvīras (saṁvṛtaḥ sindhusauvīraiḥ) 7. 85. 73; Sātyaki told Yudhiṣṭhira that Saindhavas were no match for Arjuna (saindhavapauravāḥ/…ete 'rjunasya kruddhasya kalāṁ nārhanti ṣoḍaśīm) 7. 86. 28-29; on that day the Kaurava army which included Sindhu warriors and Sauvīras ran helterskelter since they were being killed by the arrows of Bhīma and Karṇa fighting each other (tato vyudastaṁ tat sainyaṁ sindhusauvīrakauravam); they ran away from them in all directions; the earth was covered with their bodies along with their armours, arrows and banners; when Karṇa saw the destruction of the Kurus Sauvīras and Saindhavas he was ablaze with anger (dṛṣṭvā ca kurusauvī rasaindhavānāṁ balakṣayam) 7. 113. 11-14; 7. 114. 17-18; (10) During the night war (fourteenth-fifteenth day) all Saindhavas and others, afraid, (simply) watched Karṇa who alone could withstand the shower of weapons released at him by Ghaṭotkaca; they respected his composure in battle (asaṁmohaṁ pūjayanto'sya saṁkhye) 7. 154. 45; (11) After the war, the women of Sindhu, Sauvīra and other countries kept a watch on the dead body of Jayadratha (sindhusauvī ragāndhārakāmbojayavanastriyaḥ) 11. 22. 11; (12) When Arjuna reached the Sindhu country along with Aśvamedha horse, the warriors and their kings fought a fierce battle with him; they encircled Arjuna so that he looked like a bird moving in a cage (koṣṭhakīkṛtya kaunteyam…ayodhayan/sa…dadṛśe …pañjarāntarasaṁcārī śakunta iva…//) 14. 76. 10, 13; Arjuna swooned for a while due to the shower of the arrows of Sindhu fighters (saindhavāḥ) 14. 76. 21-23; when he recovered, he started showering arrows so that the Saindhava warriors and their kings could not be seen; the Saindhavas were afraid due to the sound (of the bow); they ran, wept due to sorrow and lay down on the ground; the army (of Saindhavas) was thus torn by Arjuna (tatas te saindhavā yodhāḥ sarva eva sarājakāḥ/nādṛśyanta śaraiḥ kīrṇāḥ…// tasya śabdena vitresur bhayārtāś ca vidudruvaḥ/mumucuś cāśruśokārtāḥ suṣupuś cāpi saindhavāḥ//…sainyaṁ vidārya) 14. 76. 28-29, 32; the Saindhava warriors were once again ready to fight with Arjuna and they showered arrows at him; Arjuna told them that he would not kill them if they surrundered; but Saindhava warriors continued to shoot arrows; the kings of the Sindhu country remembering the death of Jayadratha threw prāsas and śaktis on Arjuna; he cut off their missiles before they reached him; the warriors, desirous of victory, continued their attack (āpatatāṁ teṣāṁ yodhānāṁ jayagṛddhinām) 14. 77. 18; Arjuna cut off their heads; they ran away but returned and although they were being killed they fought with Arjuna according to their vigour and energy (yathāprāṇaṁ yathotsāhaṁ yodhayām āsur arjunam) most of them, whose horses were tired, swooned (kṛtā visaṁjñā bhūyiṣṭhāḥ klāntavāhanasainikāḥ); knowing their plight, Duḥśalā, daughter of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, took her grandson with her and approached Arjuna wishing peace for the surviving warriors (śāntyarthaṁ sarvayodhānām; śamārthaṁ sarvayodhānām); she requested him to cease fighting with Saindhavas (śamaṁ gaccha dhanaṁjaya); thus Arjuna defeated Saindhava warriors 14. 77. 2-43. 

  D.   Past event: Vidurā exhorted her son not to let himself be dispirited and be under the control of the maidens of Sindhu country (mā ca saindhavakanyānām avasanno vaśaṁ gamaḥ) 5. 132. 32; she told him that she would honour him if he was able to kill all Saindhava warriors (atha tvāṁ pūjayiṣyāmi hatvā vai sarvasaindhavān) 5. 133. 19.

Epic events: (1) Bhīma told Yudhiṣṭhira that it was not impossible to get back the kingdom by waging war with Kauravas since Pāṇḍavas could count on the help of Sṛñjayas, Kaikeyas and Kṛṣṇa (in such contexts they are identified with Pāñcālas) 3. 34. 85; he also told him that all his relatives as well as Sṛñjayas wish well of him and keep quiet (only he and Draupadī got excited) (sarve te priyam icchanti bāndhavāḥ saha sṛñjayaiḥ/aham eko 'bhisaṁtapto mātā ca prativindhyataḥ//) 3. 36. 15; (2) Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt that it was better to give back to Pāṇḍavas their share of kingdom before war broke out in which Yudhiṣṭhira would be backed by Kṛṣṇa, Sātyaki and Sṛñjayas 5. 22. 9; 5. 56. 33; when he sent Saṁjaya to Upaplavya, he asked him (Saṁjaya) to enquire about the health of all including Sṛñjayas (teṣāṁ bhāgaṁ…purā yuddhāt sādhu tasya pradānam//…anāmayaṁ madvacanena pṛccheḥ) 5. 22. 8-9, 38; (3) Sañjaya wanted Yudhiṣṭhira to work for peace so that Kauravas, Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas and the rest of the assembled kings would live in happis ness (śamaṁ kuryā yena śarmāpnuyus te) 5. 24. 9; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Saṁjaya to communicate the message of Dhṛtarāṣṭra to the assembly in which Sṛñjayas were also present 5. 25. 1; Saṁjaya appealed to all of them to act in a way that would lead to the well-being of Kurus and Sṛñjayas (kṛtāñjaliḥ śaraṇaṁ vaḥ prapadye kathaṁ svasti syāt kurusṛñjayānām) 5. 25. 14; Yudhiṣṭhira failed to see how there could be well-being for Kurus and Sṛñjayas when Dhṛtarāṣṭra had usurped the prosperity of Pāṇḍavas (kathaṁ svasti syāt kurusṛñjayānām/āttaiśvaryo dhṛtarāṣṭraḥ parebhyaḥ/) 5. 26. 18; Yudhiṣṭhira also told Saṁjaya that Sṛñjayas followed the advice of Kṛṣṇa and hence were capable of controlling their enemies and delighting their friends (sṛñjayāś…/upāsīnā vāsudevasya buddhiṁ…) 5. 28. 11; (4) Saṁjaya told Duryodhana that Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas heard attentively all that Arjuna wanted him to convey to the Kurus; Arjuna said that Duryodhana would repent when he saw Dhṛṣṭadyumna fighting at the head of the army of Sṛñjayas; he also told Saṁjaya that their Brāhmaṇas who were experts in astrology had predicted the destruction of Kurus and Sṛñjayas in war 5. 47. 5, 37, 93; (5) Dhṛtarāṣṭra envied those who could see and listen to the words of Kṛṣṇa which were meant for the welfare of Sṛñjayas (bhāratīm…śaṅkarīṁ sṛñjayānām) 5. 69. 2 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 71. 2: śaṁkarīṁ kalyāṇakarīm); (6) Kṛṣṇa assured Yudhiṣṭhira that when he met the Kauravas he would try to keep the agitated Kurus and Sṛñjayas away from the noose of death (mocayeyaṁ mṛtyupāśāt saṁrabdhān kurusṛñjayān) 5. 70. 81; (7) Before Kṛṣṇa left to meet the Kauravas, Draupadī told him that the Pāṇḍavas, along with Sṛñjayas would be able to face the army of Kauravas (śakṣyanti hi mahābāho pāṇḍavāḥ sṛñjayaiḥ saha/dhārtarāṣṭrabalaṁ…pratisamāsitum) 5. 80. 11 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 82. 11: pratisamāsituṁ pratipakṣatayā sthātum); according to her, severe punishment should be quickly inflicted on Kauravas by Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas and Kṛṣṇa; he should take care to see that he, along with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas, was not blamed for not killing one who deserved to be killed 5. 80. 14, 18-19; (8) Kṛṣṇa assured Vidura that he would attempt to bring about reconciliation between Kurus and Sṛñjayas who would otherwise perish in war (saṁgrāme vinaśiṣyatām) 5. 91. 8; (9) Duryodhana wanted to know from Kṛṣṇa what wrong did the Kauravas do to Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas or for what fault of Kauravas did they want to kill Kauravas (kim asmābhiḥ kṛtaṁ teṣāṁ kasmin vā punar āgasi) 5. 125. 11; (10) When Ulūka was asked by Yudhiṣṭhira to convey to the assembly the view of Duryodhana, he spoke to them who included, among others, all Sṛñjayas 5. 158. 4-5; (11) Bhīṣma assured Duryodhana that in case of war Droṇa would kill Sṛñjayas (gacched antaṁ sṛñjayānām) 5. 164. 15; (12) Before the start of the war, Duryodhana told Duḥśāsana to protect Bhīṣma so that he might kill Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas 6. 16. 14; seeing Bhīṣma at the head of the Kaurava army, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, shivered (samakampanta pāṇḍavāḥ/sṛñjayāś ca …dhṛṣṭadyumnapurogamāḥ//) 6. 16. 42; (13) On the third day of the war, due to the quickness of Bhīṣma's action, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas felt that there were many hundreds and thousands of him (anekaśatasāhasram samapaśyanta lāghavāt) 6. 55. 22 (also cf. st. 21); (14) On the fourth day, at one stage, Kurus and Sṛñjayas watched the duel between Bhīṣma and Arjuna 6. 56. 28; (15) On the fifth day, towards midday (madhyandinagate sūrye 6. 68. 12), Sṛñjayas fought a very fierce battle with Kurus in which arrows, śaktis, tomaras were used 6. 68. 15-16; the battle described 18-19; the same day, later, Sṛñjayas, when they lost their armours, and their chariots were broken and bows were cut off, and their hair dishevelled, they wrestled with Kurus (bāhubhiḥ samayudhyanta) 6. 69. 39; when the sun was about to set (sūrye 'stam upagacchati 6. 70. 34), and when the stopping of the war was declared, Pāṇḍavas, along with Sṛñjayas, went to their camps 6. 70. 37; (16) On the sixth day, when Bhīṣma and Droṇa started killing the Pāṇḍava army, Sṛñjayas and Kekayas fied (palāyanaparābhavan) 6. 71. 32; (17) On the seventh day, when Bhīṣma attacked Yudhiṣṭhira, Sṛñjayas riding chariots, elephants and horses trembled for they feared Yudhiṣṭhira would soon be killed (sarathanāgāśvāḥ samakampanta sṛñjayāḥ) 6. 82. 2-3; later in the afternoon (aparāṁ diśam āsthāya sthite savitari 6. 82. 28) Bhīṣma neglected the challenge of Śikhaṇḍin and attacked Sṛñjayas; they were happy to face Bhīṣma (sṛñjayās tu tato hṛṣṭā…) and raised loud roars and blew their conches; a fierce battle followed in which chariot-fighters and elephant-riders mingled with one another 6. 82. 26-28; (18) On the eighth day, Bhīṣma started killing Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas and others; they attacked Bhīṣma not fearing death (Sṛñjayas not directly mentioned, only Pāñcālas are mentioned); Bhīṣma cut off arms and heads of those riding horses and elephants and deprived the chariot-fighters of their chariots; he also killed elephants 6. 84. 3-7; when Droṇa killed Somakas and Sṛñjayas a loud cry went up from their army; the Kṣatriyas rolled on the ground like those afflicted by ailments; their cry was like one of those who become lean due to hunger (viveṣṭantaḥ sma dṛśyante vyādhikliṣṭā narā iva//…aniśaṁ śrūyate śabdaḥ kṣutkṛśānāṁ nṛṇām iva//) 6. 85. 20-23; after the death of Irāvant, there was fierce fighting in which the Kaurava army and Sṛñjayas, not caring for their lives in battle, killed one another; with their hair loose and without their armours, when they were deprived of their chariots and their bows were cut off they wrestled with one another (juhvataḥ samare prāṇān nijaghnur itaretaram//muktakeśā vikavacā virathāś chinnakārmukāḥ/bāhubhiḥ samayudhyanta samavetāḥ parasparam//) 6. 86. 76-77; when Bhagadatta proceeded to attack Yudhiṣṭhira, he fought a severe battle with Pāñcālas, Sṛñjayas and Kekayas who were ready to fight with their weapons (udyatāyudhaiḥ) 6. 91. 79-80; Bhīṣma told Duryodhana that since he had dug up enmity with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas he should fight with them manfully; he himself also would kill Somakas and Pāñcālas (which term includes Sṛñjayas) (yudhyasva tān adya raṇe…puruṣo bhava) 6. 94. 1315; (19) At the end of the ninth day, it appeared that Bhīṣma had defeated Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas; so at the start of the night (rātrimukhe) Pāṇḍavas, Vṛṣṇis and Sṛñjayas held consultation (mantrāya samupāviśan) 6. 103. 8, 10-11; (20) At the start of the tenth day, Kaurava army was being destroyed by the sharp arrows of Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas; hence, Bhīṣma, not caring for life, attacked them 6. 104. 23, 26, 29; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya how on the tenth day Bhīṣma, when attacked by Śikhaṇḍin determined to kill him (6. 104. 45-46), fought with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas (daśame 'hani) 6. 105. 3; when Bhīṣma began to destroy the Pāṇḍava army, the great chariot-fighters (mahārathāḥ) of Sṛñjayas attacked Bhīṣma to kill him (vadhāyābhyadravan bhīṣmam) 6. 105. 35; as the war advanced Pāṇḍavas, backed by Sṛñjayas (saṁhatāḥ saha sṛñjayaiḥ), attacked Bhīṣma 6. 110. 40; Dhṛtarāṣṭra once again asked Saṁjaya how Bhīṣma fought with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas on the tenth day 6. 111. 1; as advised by Bhīṣma, Arjuna led Sṛñjayas (and Pāñcālas) to attack Bhīṣma and kill him; Sṛñjayas were asked to attack Bhīṣma without fear as they would be protected by Bhīma and Arjuna 6. 111. 15-20; exhorted by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Somakas and Sṛñjayas attacked Bhīṣma showering weapons on him (śastravṛṣṭyā); angered Bhīṣma fought with them 6. 113. 16-18; the weapons used by Sṛñjayas are detailed in 6. 114. 2-3; Sṛñjayas and Pāṇḍavas raised a loud roar when Bhīṣma fell down 6. 114. 101; at the end of the tenth day when Dhṛtarāṣṭra was informed about Bhīṣma's downfall he wondered who could be the warriors who surrounded Bhīṣma (ke vīrāḥ paryavārayan) while he was showering arrows on Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas; he also wished to know who from among the Kauravas were on the left side of the wheel of Bhīṣma and shot arrows on Sṛñjayas (vāme cakre vartamānāḥ ke 'ghnan saṁjaya sṛñjayān) 6. 15. 25, 28, 32; (21) On hearing the death of Bhīṣma (7. 2. 1), Karṇa admitted that the army which included Pāṇḍavas, Sātyaki, Kṛṣṇa and Sṛñjayas was invincible by kings; 7. 2. 31; (22) On the eleventh day, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas met with arrows Droṇa's attack on them; Droṇa broke and scattered their army; agitated by the arrows of Droṇa, they were again and again scattered by him (te kampyamānā droṇena bāṇaiḥ pāṇḍavasṛñjayāḥ/punaḥ punar abhajyanta) 7. 6. 33, 35, 41; Sṛñjayas, though they tried, were not able to kill the army of Droṇa as it was protected by him; since Droṇa was acting very swiftly, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas felt as if there were many Droṇas (ekam āśukāriṇam āhave/anekam iva saṁtrāsān menire) 7. 12. 19, 23; Sṛñjayas trembled seeing Droṇa, like fire, burning the army of Pāṇḍavas (sākṣād agnim ivotthitam) 7. 13. 2; Sṛñjayas and others with their weapons raised (udyatāyudhāḥ) met the attack of Aśvasena and others; a fierce battle ensued 7. 15. 11-12; at the sunset when the withdrawal of the Pāṇḍava army was declared by Arjuna (svāny anīkāni… avahārayat), Sṛñjayas greeted him for his deeds during the day 7. 15. 49-50; (23) On the twelfth day, after killing Śatānīka, Droṇa repeatedly defeated Sṛñjayas and others; seeing Droṇa, like fire, burning the army of Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas trembled; due to the heroism of Droṇa, a river carrying the bodies of Kurus and Pāñcālas to the god of death began to flow (nadīm antakagāminīm) 7. 20. 23-24, 34, 36; when Droṇa killed a Pāñcāla prince, Sṛñjayas and others attacked Droṇa shouting ‘kill Droṇa, kill Droṇa’ (hata droṇaṁ hata droṇam ity āsīt tumulaṁ mahat/); but Droṇa agitated them who were very angry 7. 20. 48-49; when Sṛñjayas and others were agitated and were pushed back (calitān…praṇunnān) by the arrows of Droṇa, Kauravas raised a loud roar 7. 21. 7-8; Duryodhana drew attention of Karṇa towards Bhīma who was deserted by Pāṇḍava warriors and Sṛñjayas (hīnaḥ pāṇḍavasṛñjayaiḥ) 7. 21. 16; (24) On the thirteenth day, Pāñcāla army which included thousands of Sṛñjayas attacked Droṇa; but Droṇa arrested their advance with arrows; then Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas did not attack him 7. 34. 5-7, 10; when Abhimanyu defeated Duḥśāsana, Sṛñjayas and others were delighted 7. 39. 11, 17-18; when Subhadrā heard the death of Abhimanyu, she pitied Sṛñjayas and the rest who did not seem to know when Abhimanyu was felled down (dhik kekayāṁs… sṛñjayān/ye tvā raṇe gataṁ vīraṁ na jānanti nipātitam) 7. 55. 13; (25) On the fourteenth day, Sātyaki shot arrows at Droṇa who was as though swallowing (grasantam iva) Sṛñjayas 7. 72. 34; the demon Alambusa made a river flow on the battle-field carrying the dead bodies of Sṛñjayas and others (nadīṁ pravartayām āsa) 7. 83. 30; when the Pāṇḍava army, which included Sṛñjayas, attacked Droṇa there was a loud roar among the Sṛñjayas (tatrārāvo mahān āsīt); when Droṇa started killing them, Sṛñjayas found no protector 7. 85. 20, 26; Yudhiṣṭhira assured Sātyaki that when he (Sātyaki) would leave to assist Arjuna, Sṛñjayas and others would be there to protect him (Yudhiṣṭhira) 7. 86. 45; Sṛñjayas and others, thrilled, rushed at Droṇa to fight with him with all their might (sarvaśaktyā); but Droṇa killed them 7. 101. 50-52; Droṇa asked Duryodhana to go to help Jayadratha; he himself would obstruct the onward march of Sṛñjayas and others 7. 105. 21; (26) After the death of Jayadratha, before the start of the night war between the fourteenth and fifteenth day, Droṇa pointed out to Duryodhana the armies of Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas marching towards him (Droṇa) 7. 126. 31; he directed Duryodhana to hold back his army if he could, for Kurus and Sṛñjayas would continue to fight even during the night; with these words, Droṇa marched against Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas (tvaṁ ca duryodhana balaṁ yadi śaknoṣi dhāraya) 7. 126. 38-39; then, there was fierce fighting in the evening (saṁdhyāyām) all around between Droṇa and Sṛñjayas 7. 129. 18; when the fierce fighting progressed during the night, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas together attacked Droṇa (rātriyuddhe tathā ghore vartamāne sudāruṇe); Droṇa forced all of them back killing some of them (tān sarvān vimukhāṁś cakre kāṁścin ninye yamakṣayam) 7. 129. 34-35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya how did Kauravas feel when Droṇa entered the (army of) Sṛñjayas (kā vo 'bhūd vai matis tadā) 7. 130. 1; Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas followed Bhīma and Arjuna who showered arrows on Droṇa trying to scatter the army of Drupada with Vāyavyāstra 7. 132. 37, 41; 7. 136. 14; Aśvatthāman challenged his opponents to attack him and then killed Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas; they abandoned Aśvatthāman and fled in all directions (vyadravanta diśo daśa 7. 135. 19) when their chariots and banners were scattered (viprakīrṇarathadhvajāḥ) 7. 135. 51; Duryodhana asked Duḥśāsana and his other brothers to offer protection to Droṇa who would then kill Sṛñjayas and their kings (sṛñjayāṁś ca sarājakān); when all Sṛñjayas were killed, Aśvatthāman would kill Dhṛṣṭadyumna 7. 139. 24-25; in the fighting that followed Aśvatthāman covered Drupada and Droṇa covered Sṛñjayas with smooth arrows (chādayām āsatuḥ saṁkhye śaraiḥ saṁnataparvabhiḥ) 7. 139. 31; when Aśvatthāman swooned while fighting with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas raised a loud roar (siṁhanādaṁ pracakrire) 7. 141. 32; considering that Bhīma had killed Duryodhana, Pāñcālas, Sṛñjayas and others made all effort to attack Droṇa to fight with him (sarvodyogenābhijagmur …); a fierce battle then was fought 7. 141. 60; when Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas were being killed by Karṇa, they apprehended his presence nearby even when a blade of grass stirred (tṛṇapraspandanāc cāpi sūtaputraṁ sma menire) 7. 148. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 7. 173. 19: atibhayāt tṛṇacalanamātreṇāpi karṇaṁ prāptaṁ menire); they mistook a running warrior on their own side to be Karṇa (api svaṁ samare yodhaṁ dhāvamānaṁ vicetasaḥ/karṇam evābhyamanyanta…); hence, afraid, they ran but Karṇa attacked them from behind (pṛṣṭhato vikirañ śarān) 7. 148. 15-17; when Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas were excessively tormented by the Rākṣasas of Alāyudha they had no peace of mind (na śāntiṁ lebhire tatra) 7. 152. 31; Dhṛtarāṣṭra wondered why Karṇa, instead of killing Ghaṭotkaca, did not kill Arjuna with the śakti given to him by Indra; for, the death of Arjuna would have meant the death of all Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas long ago 7. 157. 2; the same opinion was held by Kṛṣṇa (and hence he deluded the mind of Karṇa whenever he faced Arjuna) 7. 157. 35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya how did Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas with their armies arrayed and in striking position (vyūḍhānīkāḥ prahāriṇaḥ) fight with Kurus and how did they attack Droṇa who, not caring for his life, had plunged into their army after the death of Ghaṭotkaca (jīvitaṁ tyaktvā gāhamānaṁ varūthinīm) 7. 158. 13-15; Droṇa killed three grand-sons of Drupada and then defeated Cedis, Kekayas, Sṛñjayas and Matsyas 7. 161. 31-32; (27) On the fifteenth day, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas, although they were being killed by Droṇa, attacked him and confused him (mohayanto mahāratham) 7. 164. 60; after killing Vasudāna (king of Pāṁśurāṣṭra), Droṇa killed six thousand Sṛñjayas 7. 164. 85; exhorted by Yudhiṣṭhira to assist Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the great chariot-fighters of Sṛñjayas attacked Droṇa in order to kill him; Droṇa with great speed moved against them not minding his death (martavyam iti niścitaḥ); bad omens occurred; Droṇa, encircled by the armies of Drupada, moved burning host of Kṣatriyas and killed a very large number of them 7. 165. 8-16; when ultimately Droṇa was killed by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas attacked the disheartened Kurus with the result that their army was shattered (nirutsāhān kurūn …abhyadravan…tataḥ sainyaṁ vyadīryata) 7. 165. 58; when Aśvatthāman used his nārāyaṇāstra, Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas were dismayed to see the mid-region filled with different weapons (śastrākṛtibhir ākīrṇam atīva…dṛṣṭvāntarikṣam āvignāḥ pāṇḍupāñcālasṛñjayāḥ) 7. 170. 20; at the end of the day, when Saṁjaya reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the death of Droṇa, he asked Saṁjaya what was Droṇa doing on the battle-field when Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas managed to kill him (kiṁ kurvāṇaṁ raṇe droṇam jaghnuḥ pāṇḍavasṛñjayāḥ) 7. 8. 1; Saṁjaya assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that since he was an eye-witness to the whole event (sarvaṁ pratyakṣadarśivān) he would narrate to him how Droṇa fell when overpowered (sāditaḥ) by Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas 7. 11. 1; (28) On the sixteenth day, Duryodhana was confident that with Karṇa as their general Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas would loose their consciousness (gatacetasaḥ) 8. 6. 31; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that Karṇa, as intended by Aśvatthāman (aśvatthāmanaś ca saṁkalpād…) had killed Sṛñjayas 8. 16. 5; Karṇa brought Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas within the range of his arrows and crushed them (śaragocaram ānayat/ mamarda); Kurus, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas fought with great effort not caring for their life (vyāyacchamānāḥ subhṛśam… priyān asūn raṇe tyaktvā) 8. 16. 22, 2425; battle described 8. 16. 26-38; at midday (madhyaṁ gate dinakare 8. 17. 100), although Karṇa killed Sṛñjayas they attacked him 8. 17. 117; (29) On the seventeenth day, early morning (prabhātāyāṁ rajanyāṁ tu 8. 22. 29) before the start of the war, Duryodhana while requesting Śalya to act as a charioteer of Karṇa told him that with a good charioteer like him, Karṇa would be able to destroy Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas 8. 23. 15; at the start of the war on that day, Pāñcālas, Cedis and Sṛñjayas fought a fierce battle with the Kaurava army 8. 32. 15; Dhṛtarāṣṭra remembered that Karṇa had boasted earlier that he alone would kill Sṛñjayas along with Pāṇḍavas 8. 35. 2; Sṛñjayas cut off (śātayām āsuḥ) the arrows shot at them by Kṛpa 8. 38. 4; Karṇa stopped the onward march of Sṛñjayas and others who were led by Bhīma 8. 38. 16; Karṇa killed Cedis, Karūṣas and Sṛñjayas in the presence of Bhīma; when Bhīma left Karṇa to fight with the Kuru army, Karṇa killed thousands of great archers of Sṛñjayas (sṛñjayāṁś ca maheśvāsān nijaghāna sahasraśaḥ) 8. 40. 2-4; Sṛñjayas were ‘burnt’ by the fire in the form of Karṇa (karṇāgninā …dagdhā…) 8. 40. 61; Arjuna pointed out to Kṛṣṇa that the large army of Sṛñjayas was being scattered (dīryate) by Karṇa 8. 40. 81; when Bhīma returned to fight (saṁnivṛtto raṇaṁ prati), Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, followed him 8. 41. 3; Kurus led by Karṇa and Sṛñjayas led by Yudhiṣṭhira faced one another without fear (abhītāḥ) 8. 42. 1; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that Karṇa, after defeating Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas was looking for Arjuna: when the Kuru warriors saw Karṇa displaying his valour by harassing Pāṇḍavas and thousands of Sṛñjayas they raised a loud roar (nadanti); Karṇa encouraged Kaurava warriors to attack Sṛñjayas so that none of them escaped alive (yathā jivan na vaḥ kaścin mucyate) 8. 43. 36; Kṛṣṇa was glad to point out to Arjuna that Bhīma, along with Sātyaki and Sṛñjayas, had once again returned to the battle-field 8. 43. 52; Yudhiṣṭhira wondered whether the encounter of Sṛñjayas and Kauravas in which he was humiliated had become known to the fighters (kaccit saṁgrāme vidito vā tadāyaṁ samāgamaḥ sṛñjayakauravāṇām/yatrāvasthām īdṛśīṁ prāpito 'ham) 8. 46. 41; Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna that all Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas with their followers were prepared to fight when they had resorted to him (ete ca sarve pāñcālāḥ sṛñjayāś ca sahānvayāḥ/tvāṁ samāsādya …vyavasthitāḥ) 8. 51. 5; while taking stock of some of the events of the battle which had lasted for seventeen days (adya saptadaśāhāni 8. 51. 2), Kṛṣṇa reminded Arjuna that while Bhīṣma was fighting, Sṛñjayas were unable to look at him; Bhīṣma routed Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas and distinguished himself as the sole war hero (ekavīratvam āgataḥ) 8. 51. 35; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that Bhīma, covered on all sides by Sṛñjayas, was being tormented while fighting with Karṇa: if Karṇa was neglected he might kill Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas 8. 51. 105-106; at one stage in the battle, Uttamaujas had engaged Sṛñjayas 8. 53. 6; Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot towards Karṇa, lest he destroyed all Sṛñjaya great chariot-fighters in battle in their presence (rādheyo 'py anyathā pārthān sṛñjayāṁś ca mahārathān/niḥśeṣān samare kuryāt paśyator nau janārdana//) 8. 57. 8; later, Kuru warriors and Sṛñjayas fought with one another using straightflying and very sharp arrows (śarais tadāñjogatibhiḥ sutejanaiḥ) 8. 57. 67; once again a very severe fighting broke out between Kurus and Sṛñjayas in which they used besides arrows weapons like swords, śaktis, lances, maces and paraśvadhas 8. 62. 40; when Karṇa was killed, Arjuna was honoured by Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas and others 8. 69. 37; on the seventeenth night (niśi 8. 1. 25) while reporting Karṇa's death to Dhṛtarāṣṭra Saṁjaya told him that Karṇa, before his death, had killed Kekayas and Videhas in the presence of all Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas (sa sṛñjayānāṁ sarveṣāṁ pāñcālānāṁ ca paśyatām/kekayānāṁ videhānām akarot kadanaṁ mahat//) 8. 2. 18; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya who among the Kurus and Sṛñjayas were dead and who were alive 8. 4. 3; (30) On the eighteenth day, when Śalya became the general the Madras encouraged him saying that he was capable of defeating in battle even gods and demons, let alone mortals like Somakas and Sṛñjayas 9. 6. 9; a fierce battle was fought by Sṛñjayas with Kurus which terrorized Kurus (kurūṇāṁ bhayavardhanam) 9. 8. 1; as a result of the battle there began to flow a terrific river (nadī raudrā) filled with the bodies of Kurus and Sṛñjayas (kurusṛñjayasaṁkulā) 9. 8. 32; seeing the heroic deeds (vikramam) of Śalya, Duryodhana considered Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas (as good as) dead (nihatān…mene) 9. 12. 28; finally, when Śalya was killed, Pāṇḍavas and Śṛñjayas chased the shattered (prabhagnān) army of Kauravas 9. 18. 28; when Śālva, riding an elephant, attacked the Pāṇḍava army, Sṛñjayas and others thought his swiftly moving single elephant, to be several thousands (sahasraśo vai vicarantam ekam) 9. 19. 6; when the Pāṇḍava army was broken, Kaurava heroes blew, in joy, their conches; Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the general of the armies of Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas, could not bear the sound of the roar indicative of the joy of Kauravas (8. 19. 10); seeing the (heroic) deeds of Śālva, Sṛñjayas and others encircled his elephant 9. 19. 21; during the war of eighteen days eleven akṣauhiṇis of Duryodhana's army were killed by Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas 9. 28. 14; Duryodhana felt confident to defeat Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas with mace as his weapon 9. 31. 30; Bhīma told Yudhiṣṭhira, accompanied by Sṛñjayas (sṛñjayaiḥ saha tiṣṭhantam), that he was prepared to accept the challenge of Duryodhana 9. 32. 28; Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas applauded Duryodhana's words asking Bhīma to prove his words (darśayasva balaṁ yuddhe) 9. 32. 49-50; when Balarāma came to witness the duel between Bhīma and Duryodhana, he embraced Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas and enquired about their well being (apṛcchat kuśalaṁ sarvān) 9. 33. 11; Duryodhana asked Yudhiṣṭhira, along with Sṛñjayas, to watch the duel 9. 54. 38-39; when Duryodhana was forced to kneel down by Bhīma, Sṛñjayas raised a loud roar; hearing their roar, Duryodhana was enraged 9. 56. 54-55; when Bhīma felled down Duryodhana he told Kṛṣṇa, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas that he had killed the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra on the strength of Draupadī's tapas (raṇe hatāṁs tapasā yājñasenyāḥ) 9. 58. 9-10; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya what did the Sṛñjayas do when Duryodhana was struck down; Saṁjaya told him that they waived their upper garments and raised a loud roar; the earth was unable to bear them who were filled with delight (āvidhyan uttarīyāṇi siṁhanādāṁś ca nedire/naitān harṣasamāviṣṭān iyam sehe vasundharā//) 9. 60. 3-4; some shook their bows, others their bow-strings; still others blew their large conches or struck the dundubhis; some made sportive gestures, others laughed (cikrīḍus tathaivānye jahasuś ca) 9. 60. 5-6; they praised Bhīma's act in so many words and were happy that he had brought the enmity to an end (vairasya ca gataḥ pāram); they said that the horripilation experienced by them at the time of Duryodhana's fall had not yet subsided (duryodhanavadhe yāni romāṇī hṛṣitāni naḥ/adyāpi na vihṛṣyanti tāni…) 9. 60. 7-16; Kṛṣṇa told Sṛñjayas not to rebuke Duryodhana anymore because he was already killed when he refused to give Pāṇḍavas their share although advised to do that, among others, by them (ºgāṅgevasṛñjayaiḥ/…procyamāno 'pi) 9. 60. 20; (31) During the massacre which took place at night of the eighteenth day, Aśvatthāman killed Pāṇḍava warriors and Sṛñjayas who were without weapons and armours and were agitated (apetaśastrasaṁnāhān saṁrabdhān pāṇḍusṛñjayān) 10. 8. 74; Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman told Aśvatthāman that they had killed Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas by thousands (as they were trying to escape from the camp) (vinikṛttān sahasraśaḥ) 10. 8. 141; (32) More than a hundred Sṛñjayas (sṛñjayāṁś ca śatādhikān) were put on the funeral pyre along with the dead bodies of other fallen heroes and were cremated according to the prescribed rites 11. 26. 30, 33, 38.

  A.   Origin and activity: According to Bhīṣma, Candra, Āditya and other planets, the constellations and stars were born from Viṣvaksena (i. e. Kṛṣṇa) (candrādityau grahanakṣatratārāḥ…viṣvaksenāt sarvam etat prasūtam) 13. 143. 31; Puruṣottama (Nārāyaṇa) told the seven sages, Marīci and others, that the sun, the moon, all constellations act in their own prescribed way in their respective spheres and are considered an authority (sūryācandramasau…adnikāreṣu vartante yathāsvaṁ…sarve pramāṇaṁ hi) 12. 322. 39-40. 

  B.   Born repeatedly, its waxing and waning: The moon is born repeatedly (candramā jāyate punaḥ) 3. 297. 47; vanishes thousands of times (candramā iva…sahasraśaḥ/līyate) 12. 293. 3; the moon waxes and wanes (kṣayaṁ vṛddhiṁ ca candrasya) 12. 290. 46; the moon on the new moon day remains only as a very thin digit (viddhi candramasaṁ darśe sūkṣmayā kalayā sthitam) 12. 233. 15; the fifteen digits of the moon are its source and abode; the moon also has a sixteenth digit, which is very thin, and that is the real moon; that digit is not used by gods but it favours gods (?) (kalāḥ pañcadaśā yonis tad dhāma iti paṭhyate/nityam etad vijānīhi somaḥ ṣoḍaśamī kalā/…ṣoḍaśā tu kalā sūkṣmā sa soma upadhāryatām/na tūpayujyate devair devān upayanakati sā//) 12. 293. 4, 6 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 304. 6: devair indriyair na upayujyate pālyate kiṁtu devān eva sattāsphūrtipradānena upayunakti pālayati). 

  C.   Description: highsouled (mahātman) 6. 13. 42; whose rays are cool (śītaraśmi) 6. 13. 42; 

  D.   Extent: Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya to tell him everything about the extent (sarvaṁ pramāṇam) of Soma, to which Saṁjaya agreed 6. 12. 3-4; according to Saṁjaya's information the diameter (viṣkambha) of Candramas was 11000 yojanas and its circumference (maṇḍalam) 33000 yojanas; (according to the learned Paurāṇikas) the expanse (vaipulya) of the moon was 5900 yojanas (candramās tu sahasrāṇi rājann ekādaśa smṛtaḥ/viṣkambheṇa kuruśreṣṭha trayastriṁśat tu maṇḍalam//ekonaśaṣṭir vaipulyāc chītaraśmer mahātmanaḥ) 6. 13. 42 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 12. 41 interprets vipulatvena as tato 'py ādhikyena; in that case moon's circumference will be 33000 + 5900 = 38900; see also the editor's note on the stanza 6. 13. 41, Vol. 7, p. 765); on account of the larger extent of Rāhu, it covers the sun and the moon at proper times (sa rāhuś chādayaty etau yathākālaṁ mahattayā/candrādityau) 6. 13. 45. 

  E.   Importance: (1) Upamanyu, while praising Śiva, said that he (Śiva) was Candramas among the nakṣatras (nakṣatrāṇāṁ ca candramāḥ) 13. 14. 156; Soma appears among the names of Śiva (somo nakṣatrasādhakaḥ) 13. 17. 36; also Candra in a complex form (candrasūryagatiḥ) 13. 17. 37; (2) Soma appears as one of the names of Sūrya taught by Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 19; (3) God Śiva made moon (Niśākara) the chief of the constellations (cakre nakṣatrāṇāṁ niśākaram (īśam)) 12. 122. 31; Candramas is known as the chief of the constellations (nakṣatrāṇāṁ ca candramāḥ (adhipaḥ)) 14. 43. 6; Indu is known as the chief of the luminous bodies (jyotiṣām indur (adhipatiḥ) ucyate) 14. 43. 7; hence Soma is called grahagaṇeśvara 13. 66. 12; grahapati 12. 118. 15; 12. 162. 24; Candra and Sūrya are surrounded by the planets (candrasūryau grahair vṛtau) 3. 267. 17; moon is nakṣatrarāj 3. 226. 10; 12. 29. 123; it is surrounded by the nakṣatras 5. 138. 27; it is accompanied by the nakṣatras (sanakṣatraḥ) 6. 7. 14; followed by the planets, constellations and stars 3. 266. 2; shines along with the planets and many constellations 3. 179. 12; called tārādhipa 1. 61. 30; 3. 264. 18, 20; 11. 19. 17; 12. 289. 60; 12. 327. 8; 13. 124. 4; tārāpati 3. 264. 38; 3. 277. 22; 3. 292. 1; tārakārāja 3. 42. 14. uḍurāj 9. 34. 36; 12. 52. 18; 13. 14. 110; 14. 63. 3; uḍupati 9. 50. 1; uḍupa 3. 146. 68; (4) Soma is also the lord of the plants (oṣadhīnāṁ patiḥ) 14. 43. 8; (5) Candra, along with Āditya and Budha, present in the abode of Brahmadeva 1. 203. 4; Candramas and the constellations wait on Brahmadeva in his sabhā 2. 11. 17-18. 

  F.   Advent of Kṛta Yuga: When the Moon, the Sun, the Tiṣya (Puṣya) and Bṛhaspati will come in one rāśi, the Kṛta age will commence 3. 188. 87 (for the citation and Nī.'s com, on it see  Puṣya^1,  p. 257. 1). 

  G.   Mythological events: (1) Pained due to the destruction indulged in by Sunda and Upasunda, the moon, the sun, the planets, the stars, the constellations and the denizens of the heaven felt dejected (candrādityau grahās tārā nakṣatrāṇi divaukasaḥ/jagmur viṣādam) 1. 202. 26; (2) When the gods made ready an excellent chariot for Śiva's fight with the Tripuras, Sūrya and Candramas were made its wheels (sūryācandramasau kṛtvā cakre rathavarottame) 8. 24. 71. 

  H.

  I.   Omens: (1) While pointing out different bad omens to Kṛṣṇa, Karṇa said that the mark on Soma had disappeared (somasya lakṣma vyāvṛttam) 5. 141. 10 (But Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 143. 11: lakṣma vyāvṛttaṁ kṣīṇatvād amāvāsyāsānnidhyāt kṣīṇacandro 'pi pāpa eva); the same bad omen was noticed by Vyāsa also which, according to him, indicated great danger (vyāvṛttaṁ lakṣma somasya bhaviṣyati mahad bhayam) 6. 2. 32 (Here Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 2. 32: vyāvṛttaṁ naṣṭaṁ lakṣmahīnaś candra dṛśyata ity arthaḥ); a similar sight was noticeable at the junction of the Tretā and the Dvāpara when there occurred a drought for twelve years; at that time Soma, with its mark disappeared, receded to the south (jagāma dakṣiṇaṁ māragaṁ somo vyāvṛttalakṣaṇaḥ) 12. 139. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 141. 15: vyāvṛttaṁ anyathābhūtaṁ lakṣaṇaṁ cihnaṁ yasya); (2) According to another omen noticed by Vyāsa and reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the moon on the Kārttikī full moon night, being without lustre, was (sometimes ?) not visible, and (at other times ?) with the colour of fire appeared in the sky which had the same colour (alakṣyaḥ prabhayā hīnaḥ paurṇamāsīṁ ca kārttikīm/candro 'bhūd agnivarṇaś ca samavarṇe nabhastale) 6. 2. 23; (3) According to a third omen noticed by Vyāsa, whether it was day or night, the sun, the moon and the costellations appeared blazing; that indicated destruction (jvalitārkendunakṣatraṁ nirviśeṣadinakṣapam/ahorātraṁ mayā dṛṣṭaṁ tat kṣayāya bhaviṣyati//) 6. 2. 22; (4) According to another astronomical event, Vyāsa noticed that the amāvāsyā had occurred on the thirteenth day of the month which was very unusual; on that day Candra and Sūrya both were swallowed the same month by Rāhu at an improper time 6. 2. 28-29 (for citation and Nī.'s commentary see Sūrya p. 276. 2); (5) A similar event-Rāhu swallowed Āditya and at the same time Soma-occurred when the Sindhu heroes fought with Arjuna (rāhur agrasad ādityaṁ yugapat somam eva ca) 14. 76. 15; (6) Saṁjaya told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that the day on which the two armies gathered at Kurukṣetra, Soma was in the constellation Maghā and the seven principal planets gathered in the sky blazing (for the citation and Nī.'s commentary on it see above  Maghā,  p. 263. 1); (7) Yājñavalkya told Janataka that one to whom the full moon appeared broken towards the south had only a year to live (purṇenduṁ (dīpam eva ca)/khaṇḍābhāsaṁ dakṣiṇatas te 'pi saṁvatsarāyuṣaḥ//) 12. 305. 9; (8) He also told Janaka that one who saw Soma with a hole like a wheel with a broken nave had only a week to live (śīrṇanābhi yathā cakraṁ chidraṁ somaṁ prapaśyati/ saptarātreṇa mṛtyubhāk) 12. 305. 13. 

  J.   Similes: (1) Rohiṇī's association with the moon: Sudeva wondered when would Damayantī be associated with Nala, as Rohiṇī with Śaśin, and end her miseries (rohiṇī śaśino yathā) 3. 65. 21; Śāntā waited on Ṛśyaśrṅga as Rohiṇī on Soma (khe rohiṇī somam ivāmukūlā) 3. 113. 22; Kuntī blessed Draupadi after her marriage saying that she might be united with her husbands as Rohiṇī with Soma (rohiṇī ca yathā some) 1. 191. 5; also cf. candraś ca rohiṇyām 5. 115. 9; rohiṇī śaśinaḥ 13. 134. 4; (2) Moon's association with the other nakṣatras: (i) Kṛttikās: The king of the Prāgjyotiṣa with a white parasol decorated with garlands (mālayadāmavatā…śvetacchatreṇa) shone like the moon on a full moon day in conjunction with the Kṛttikās (kṛttikāyogayuktena paurṇamāsyām ivendunā) 7. 19. 18; (ii) Sāvitra: Droṇa in the company of the five Pāṇḍava brothers looked like the moon in association with the constellation Sāvitra (i. e.

*2nd word in left half of page p79  (+offset) in original book.Stavarāja  : m.: Name (?) of a collection of names (nāmasaṁhāram 13. 17. 1; nāmasamuddeśam 13. 17. 12, 11) of Śiva 13. 17. 21; these are one thousand and eight names of Śarva 13. 17. 29; the names are listed in 13. 17. 30-150. 

  A.   Original composer and transmission: Originally Brahmā sang the Stava (yat purā lokakṛj jagau) 13. 16. 66; yad uktaṁ padmayoninā 13. 17. 12) and himself preserved the Stava of Bhagavān (Śiva) (stavam etaṁ bhagavato brahmā svayam adhārayat) 13. 17. 164; 13. 17. 154; 13. 17. 5; 13. 16. 66; from him it went successively to Śakra (Indra) and others 13. 17. 164-168; one of the receivers in this line was Taṇḍi who obtained it in the abode of Brahman after he had performed severe austerities 13. 17. 165; he handed it over to Śukra Bhārgava 13. 16. 66; 13. 16. 75 (?); at the end of the line of transmission stood Mārkaṇḍeya who taught it to Upamanyu when the latter had observed certain rules (mārkaṇḍeyān mayā prāptaṁ niyamena janārdana 13. 17. 169) and Upamanyu gave it to Janārdana (Kṛṣṇa) 13. 17. 168169; 13. 17. 1, 5-6; since, in bygone days, it was once taught by Taṇḍi it also came to be looked upon as composed by Taṇḍi; moreover Taṇḍi had brought it down from heaven to this world (yasmāt taṇḍiḥ purā prāha tena taṇḍikṛto 'bhavat/svargāc caivātra bhūlokaṁ taṇḍinā hy avatāritaḥ//) 13. 17. 22; 13. 16. 66. 75; 13. 17. 3; the Stavarāja was brought down (to this world) from the Brahmaloka 13. 17. 21, 4; Upamanyu is also said to have received it directly from Taṇḍi (taṇḍir ākhyātavān mama/nāmāni) 13. 16. 73, 72. 

  B.   Activity of Upamanyu: Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) had mentioned ten thousand names of Sarva (Śiva) in the Vedas and one thousand names of Śarva (Śiva) in the Śāstras (daśa nāmasahasrāṇi vedeṣv āha pitāmahaḥ/śarvasya śāstreṣu tathā daśa nāmaśatāni vai//) 13. 16. 74; 13. 17. 13; Upamanyu made an abridgement (in the form of Stavarāja) out of the ten thousand names as one churns ghṛta from curds (nāmnāṁ kaṁcit samuddeśaṁ vakṣye hy avyaktayoninaḥ…daśa nāmasakasrāṇi yāny āha prapitāmahaḥ/tāni nirmathya manasā dadhno ghṛtam ivoddhṛtam) 13. 17. 11, 13. (for other similes cf. 13. 17. 14); Upamanyu gave to Kṛṣṇa this form of the stava, which constituted Mahādeva's (Śiva's) carita, having fewer words (and syllables) and being concise in meaning (kiṁ tu devasya mahataḥ saṁkṣiptārthapadākṣaram/ śaktitaś caritaṁ vakṣye) 13. 17. 9; this abridged form looked upon as the essence of the original (tathaitat sāram uddhṛtam) 13. 17. 14. 

  C.   Its name: After its composition Brahmā destined it to be the king of all the divine stavas; since then it came to be known as Stavarāja of Īśvara (sarvastavānāṁ divyānāṁ rājatve samakalpayat//tadāprabhṛti caivāyam īśvarasya mahātmanaḥ/stavarājeti vīkhyātaḥ) 13. 17. 20-21. 

  D.   Description: The best of all stavas (stavānām uttamaṁ stavam) 13. 17. 19, 23; famous (viśruta) 13. 17. 169; excellent (pravara) 13. 17. 4; of the first rank (prathama) 13. 17. 4; associated with the four vedas (caturvedasamanvita) 13. 17. 15; means of purifying (pāvana) 13. 17. 15; (pavitra) 13. 17. 19; destroyer of all sins (sarvapāpāmāpaha) 13. 17. 15; (sarvapāpapraṇāśana) 13. 17. 23; killer of demons (rakṣoghna) 13. 17. 15; auspicious (maṅgala) 13. 17. 19; holy (śubha) 13. 17. 4; the best among auspicious (sarvamaṅgalamaṅgalya) 13. 17. 23; holy (puṇya) 13. 17. 19; most beneficial (kalyāṇam uttamam) 13. 17. 19; leading to heaven (svargya) 13. 17. 4, 169; giving calmness of mind (śāntida) 13. 17. 15; conferring health (ārogya), long life (āyuṣya), wealth (dhanya) and strength (balya) 13. 17. 169; conferring welfare (pauṣṭika) 13. 17. 15; beneficial to all beings (sarvabhūtahita) 13. 17. 4; looked upon as the highest brahman (paramaṁ brahma) 13. 17. 154; 13. 16. 66, as eternal brahman (brahma sanātanam) 13. 17. 6. 

  E.   Importance: This Stavarāja is equal to meditation, practice of Yoga, the best thing to meditate on; it deserves to be recited; it is itself knowledge and the highest secret; if one knows it even at the end of one's life one can attain the highest state after life (idaṁ dhyānam idaṁ yogam idaṁ dhyeyam anuttamam/ idaṁ japyam idaṁ jñānaṁ rahasyam idam uttamam/idaṁ jñātvāntakāte 'pi gacched dhi paramāṁ gatim//) 13. 17. 18; this great, eternal secret was proclaimed by Brahman himself (yat tad rahasyaṁ paramaṁ brabmaproktaṁ sanātanam) 13. 17. 5. 

  F.   Who may receive the Stavarāja: It may be taught to one who is devoted (to god), to one who has faith, and one who believes in god; but it should not be taught to a nonbeliever who is lack of faith in the bodily form and who has not controlled his self (idaṁ bhaktāya dātavyaṁ śraddadhānāstikāya ca/nāśraddadhānarūpāya nāstikāyājitāmane) 13. 17. 16 (Unknown commentator: vedabodhitaphalāvaśyaṁbhāvaniścayaḥ śraddhā/vedāḥ pramāṇam iti jñānavān āstikaḥ/uktaviparīto nāstikaḥ Cr. Ed. 17(2). 1062. on 13. 17. 6); it should not be taught to one who scorns god Pinākin (Śiva); such a person goes to hell with his ancestors and descendants 13. 17. 17; it should be learnt with due effort and then be preserved by one who has controlled his mind (prayatnenādhigantavyaṁ dhāryaṁ ca prayatātmanā) 13. 17. 15. 

  G.   Rewards obtained: By listening to the name of Śarva listed in the Stavarāja one obtains all desires 13. 17. 29; by reciting this Stava the sage Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana obtained all his desires while he was practising austerities on mount Meru for a son; he therefore advised Yudhiṣṭhira to recite the stava so that he would also obtain all his desires by the grace of Maheśvara 13. 18. 1-3; by praising Śiva with the names in this stava one obtains one's Self (prāpnoty ātmānam ātmanā) 13. 17. 153; god Mahādeva is pleased by the recitation of his names and he establishes his devotees in himself (bhaktānukampī bhagavān ātmasaṁsthān karoti tān) 13. 17. 155; by its recitation a person who is cleansed of his sins becomes devoted to Bhava (Śiva) which (devotion) leads him to attain the highest perfection (jantor viśuddhapāpasya bhave bhaktiḥ prajāyate/… tasyaiva ca prasādena bhaktir utpadyate nṛṇām/yayā yāti parāṁ siddhim) 13. 17. 158, 160; the demons, the Yakṣas, the Rākṣasas, the Piśācas, the Yātudhānas, the Guhyakas and the snakes do not put obstacle in the way (of one who recites this stava) 13. 17. 170; he who observing rules of purity and celibacy, with controlled senseorgans, recites this stava for one year without a break in application obtains the fruit of performing an Aśvamedha sacrifice (yaḥ paṭheta śucir bhūtvā brahmacārī jitendriyaḥ/abhagnayogo varṣaṁ tu so' śvamedhaphalaṁ labhet//) 13. 17. 171; by praising god Mahādeva with the names (in this Stava) Jāmadagnya, who was afflicted by the sin of killing his father and the Brāhmaṇas (? pitṛvipravadhenāham ārtaḥ;) 13. 18. 10 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 18. 12: pitṛtulyā viprāḥ ‘jyeṣṭho bhrātā pituḥ samaḥ’ iti smṛter jyeṣṭhā bhrātaras teṣāṁ vadhena), was freed of the sin; in addition the god gave him an axe and divine missiles and made him invincible; god of death would not overpower Jāmadagnya and he would be famous 13. 18. 9-12 (pāpaṁ na bhavitā te 'dya ajeyaś ca bhaviṣyasi/na te prabhavitā mṛtyur yaśasvī ca bhaviṣyasi// 12).

  A.   Origin: The god of gods (Nārāyaṇa) told Mārkaṇḍeya that the three Vedas and the Atharvaṇa arise out of him and enter into him again (yajurvedo 'pyatharvaṇaḥ/mattaḥ prādurbhavanty ete mām eva praviśanti ca) 3. 187. 14. 

  B.   What it does and does not contain: Vyāsa told his son Śuka that one should study the trayī vidyā contained in the Ṛk, the Yajus, and the Sāman, as also in the Atharvan (trayīvidyām avekṣeta vedeṣūktām athāṅgataḥ/ṛksāmavarṇākṣarato yajuṣo'tharvaṇas tathā) 12. 227. 1; Bhagavān (Kṛṣṇa) told Arjuna that the great sages had mentioned many of his names in the Atharvan as well as in the other vedas (ṛgvede sayajurvede tathaivātharvasāmasu…bahūni mama nāmāni kīrtitāni maharṣibhiḥ) 12. 328. 8-9; the sage Sanatsujāta told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that the highest principle (brahman) was not to be found in the Atharvan mantras, nor in the ṛks, the yajus, or the sāmans (naivarkṣu tan na yajuḥṣu nāpy atharvasu na caiva dṛśyaty amaleṣu sāmasu) 5. 44. 21. 

  C.   Object of study: Sages versed in the Atharvaveda recited this Saṁhitā in accordance with the pada and the krama mode of recitation (atharvavedapravarāḥ…saṁhitām īrayanti sma padakramayutāṁ tu te) 1. 64. 33; a certain Ṛṣi, born in the family of a Purohita (not named), when grew up learnt, among other sciences, the Veda and the Atharvaveda (atharvavede vede ca babhūvarṣiḥ suniścitaḥ) 13. 10. 34; Bhagavān (Kṛṣṇa) told Arjuna that the Vipras who had learnt the Atharvāṇa looked upon him as Atharvan consisting of five kalpas, enlarged by kṛtyās (pañcakalpam atharvāṇaṁ kṛtyābhiḥ paribṛṁhitam/kalpayanti hi māṁ viprā atharvāṇavidas tathā) 12. 330. 34. 

  D.   Use: 1. For worship: When the sage Aṅgiras visited Indra he used for worshipping the god the mantras from the Atharvaveda (atharvavedamantraiś ca); Indra, while giving the sage a boon addressed him as Atharvāṅgiras and said that the mantras from the Atharvaveda used by him for his praise would be known as the Atharvāṅgirasa section of that Veda (atharvāṅgirasaṁ nāma asmin vede bhaviṣyati/udāharaṇam etad dhi) 5. 18. 5-7; 2. For magic: the Daityas and the Dānavas residing in the Pātāla and who had studied the different mantras performed a sacrificial rite (karma vaitānasaṁbhavam) by using mantras which included those known from the Atharvaveda (bṛhaspatyuśanoktaiś ca mantrair mantraviśāradāḥ/atharvavedaproktaiś ca) in order to produce a kṛtyā who was commissioned to fetch Duryodhana who had decided to fast unto death 3. 239. 20. 

  E.   Personified: the Atharvaveda, along with the other three Vedas, seen by Nārada in the Sabhā of god Brahmadeva (atharvavedaś ca tathā…sarvaṁ tasyāṁ mayā dṛṣṭam) 2. 11. 23, 33, [See  Atharvaśiras, Atharvāṅgirasa, Ātharvaṇa ]

(6) When the Yādavas left, after giving gifts to Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa stayed behind at Śakraprastha (uvāsa nagare ramye śrakraprasthe mahāmanāḥ) 1. 213. 57; (7) Sairandhrī told Uttara that Bṛhannaḍā was the charioteer of Arjuna when he defeated all kinds of beings at Khāṇḍavaprastha (ajayat khāṇḍavaprasthe) 4. 34. 15 (here Khāṇḍavaprastha stands for Khāṇḍava forest); this feat of Arjuna at Khāṇḍavaprastha (= Khāṇḍava forest) also referred to by Kṛṣṇa in his address to Duryodhana (ajayat khāṇḍavaprasthe) 5. 122. 52, and by Karṇa when he spoke to Śalya (prasthe 'jayat khāṇḍave savyasācī) 8. 29. 18;

(16) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Vidura to go to Khāṇḍavaprastha to invite Yudhiṣṭhira for a game of dice 2. 45. 56; (17) At the end of the first game of dice, Dhṛtarāṣṭra permitted Yudhiṣṭhira to return to Khāṇḍvaprastha 2. 65. 15; accordingly Yudhiṣṭhira, with his brothers and Draupadī, left for Indraprastha 2. 65. 17; (18) The bright prosperity (at the time of Rājasūya) of Yudhiṣṭhira while he was ruling at Indraprastha (indraprasthagate…yudhiṣṭhire) was snatched away from him by Duryodhana in the game of dice (Karṇa told Duryodhana) 3. 226. 5-6; (19) People lamented when Yudhiṣṭhira had to leave for the forest leaving behind the great city Śatakratuprastha founded by himself (svayaṁ niveśya …puraṁ mahat…śatakratuprastham… hitvā prayātaḥ kva nu dharmarājaḥ) 3. 24. 11; (20) Kṛṣṇa had assured Yudhiṣṭhira when he met him in the forest that he (Kṛṣṇa) could kill the Kauravas and get back for him his prosperity which he had seen at Indraprastha at the time of Rājasūya (and of which he was now deprived) 3. 48. 17, 23; (21) Duryodhana reminded Dhṛtarāṣṭra that when Kṛṣṇa and the other kings met the Pāṇḍavas in the forest, at a place not far from Indraprastha (vanaṁ pravrājitān pārthān…indraprasthasya cādūrāt samājagmuḥ), they blamed Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the other Kauravas 5. 54. 2, 4; (22) Aśvatthāman asked Karṇa in derision in which battle did he (Karṇa) win Indraprastha from the Pāṇḍavas; now Karṇa should fight with Arjuna (at the time of the cowraid at Virāṭanagara) since he was responsible for the game of dice and for winning Indraprastha 4. 45. 10, 21; (23) Yudhiṣṭhira told Saṁjaya “Let Suyodhana recognize my kingship at Indraprastha and I shall be at peace with the Kauravas” (śāntiṁ gamiṣyāmi yathā tvam āttha/indraprasthe bhavatu mamaiva rājyaṁ suyodhano yacchatu bhāratāgryaḥ//) 5. 26. 28; he again asked Saṁjaya to tell Duryodhana: “Hand over Śakrapura to me or get ready for battle” (dadasva vā śakrapuraṁ mamaiva yudhyasva vā bhāratamukhya vīra//) 5. 30. 47; Bhīṣma, after he fell on the battefield, also advised to hand over half of the kingdom to the Pāṇḍavas and let Yudhiṣṭhira rule at Indraprastha (rājyasyārdhaṁ dīyatāṁ pāṇḍavānām indraprasthaṁ dharmarājo 'nuśāstu) 6. 116; 48. (24) Kṛṣṇa reminded Dhṛtarāṣṭra that he himself and his sons had sent away Yudhiṣṭhira to Indraprastha (indraprasthaṁ tvayaivāsau saputreṇa vivāsitaḥ), where he (Yudhiṣṭhira) brought under control other kings and made them subservient to Dhṛtarāṣṭra 5. 93. 55-56 (reference to 1. 199. 24-25; 1. 214. 1); (25) After the Pāṇḍavas won the war, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna rejoiced at Indraprastha 14. 15. 5; (26) Arjuna told Vasudeva that he would take with him women folk, as also the young and the old, of the Vṛṣṇis, to Indraprastha 16. 8. 5; He told the Brāhmaṇas and the merchants of Dvārakā (naigamāḥ), who had gathered around him, that he would take with him the Vṛṣṇis and the Andhakas to Śakraprastha since Dvārakā would be merged in the ocean (śakraprastham ahaṁ neṣye vṛṣṇyandhakajanaṁ svayam/idaṁ tu nagaraṁ sarvaṁ samudraḥ plāvayiṣyati) 16. 8. 10; he also told them that Vajra would be their king at Śakraprastha (vajro 'yaṁ bhavatāṁ rājā śakraprasthe bhavīṣyati) 16. 8. 11; Arjuna rehabilitated the old, the young and the women of the Vṛṣṇis and the Andhakas at Śakraprastha (śakraprasthe nyaveśayat) 16. 8. 68; Arjuna gave the kingdom of Indraprastha to Vajra 16. 8. 70; (27) Yudhiṣṭhira told Subhadrā, when he decided to abandon the kingdom, that Parikṣit would be the king of Hāstinapura and Vajra, the Yādava, of Śakraprastha (parikṣid dhāstinapure śakraprasthe tu yādavaḥ/vajro rājā) 17. 1. 9. 

  E.   Similes: (1) Khāṇḍavaprastha compared with Bhogavatī, the city of the Nāgas (suśubhe tat puraśreṣṭhaṁ nāgair bhogavatī yathā) 1. 1. 9. 30; 1. 199. 49; (2) Compared with heaven (tat triviṣṭapasaṁkāśaṁ indraprasthaṁ vyarocata) 1. 199. 35; (devapuraprakāśam) 3. 24. 11. [See  Udayendu ]

_______________________________
*3rd word in left half of page p300  (+offset) in original book.Ṛc  : f. (mostly plural): Often stands for the Ṛgveda or stanzas in it; in such contexts Ṛc often occurs along with Yajus and Sāman. 

  A.   Number: their number given as ten thousand (daśedam ṛksahasrāṇi) 12. 238. 14 (daśa kiṁcidadhikāni ṛksahasrāṇi) Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 246. 14). 

  B.   Their study recommended and their chanting referred to: the Brāhmaṇas are enjoined to study the ṛcs, the yajuses and the sāmans (sarvān vedān adhīyīta…ṛco yajūṁṣi sāmāni) 12. 243. 2; 12. 260. 36; these are to be studied with due respect for the teacher; hence, while taking an oath to prove his innocence, Bharadvāja said: “who steals the lotus-stalks, may he study ṛcs and yajuses disrespecting his teacher” (upādhyāyam adhaḥ kṛtvā ṛco 'dhyetu yajūṁṣi ca/ …bisastainyaṁ karoti yaḥ) 13. 95. 62; a Brāhmaṇa who can recite the ṛcs, the yajuses and sing the sāmans is considered to be the proper person to receive gifts (ṛgyajuḥsāmago vidvān…pātram ucyate) 12. 297. 15; such a learned Brāhmaṇa is to be honoured as a god (ṛgyajuḥsāmavid pūjyo nityaṁ syād devavad dvijaḥ) 12. 60. 42; Brāhmaṇas, accompanying the Pāṇḍavas to the Dvaitavana, recited ṛcs, yajuses, and sāmans (yajuṣāṁ ṛcāṁ ca sāmnāṁ ca…āsīd uccāryamāṇānām nisvano hṛdayaṁgamaḥ) 3. 27. 3; those who had studied the ṛcs, recited them according to the pada- and the krama-pāṭha in the sacrificial rites performed in Kaṇva's hermitage (ṛco bahvṛcamukhyaiś ca preryamāṇāḥ padakramaiḥ/śuṣrāva…vitateṣv iha karmasu) 1. 64. 31; one should study trayī vidyā (threefold knowledge), detailed in the Vedas, from ṛc, yajus, sāman, and atharvan (trayīvidyām avekṣeta vedeṣūktām athāṅgataḥ/ṛksāmavarṇākṣarato yajuṣo 'tharvaṇas tathā) 12. 227. 1. 

  C.   Their importance for Dharmaśāstra and Adhyātmaśāstra: the śāstra, consisting of a hundred thousand ślokas, produced by the seven sages, Marīci, Atri and others (12. 322. 26-27), and which is approved by the ṛcs, yajuses and sāmans, as well as by the atharvāṅgirasas will be the source of dharma (kṛtaṁ śatasahasraṁ hi ślokānām idam uttamam/…pravṛttau ca nivṛttau ca yonir etad bhaviṣyati/ṛgyajuḥsāmabhir juṣṭam atharvāṅgirasais tathā//) 12. 322. 36-37; Bhagavān (Kṛṣṇa) identifies himself with ṛc, sāman and yajus (aham…ṛk sāma yajur eva ca) 6. 31. 17; the śāstra constituting the secret of all the Vedas and leading to the knowledge of ātman was churned out like nectar from the ten thousand ṛcs (rahasyaṁ sarvavedānāṁ…ātmapratyayikaṁ śāstraṁ…daśedam ṛksahasrāṇi nirmathyāmṛtam uddhṛtam) 12. 238. 13-14; there is only one sāman, one yajus and one ṛc (ekaṁ sāma yajur ekam ṛg ekā) 12. 60. 45 (Nī. on 12. 60. 47 Bom. Ed. akāro vai sarvā vāk…iti śruter ekam akārarūpam eva akṣaraṁ yathā sāmādirūpam). 

  D.   Their use and importance for rites (real or metaphorical): ṛcs and sāmans were chanted at the cremation rites of those fallen in the war (sāmnāṁ ṛcāṁ ca nādena) 11. 26. 40; those who know Nārāyaṇa recite ṛcs (= stanzas as holy ṛcs ?) to the effect that when formerly animals were bound for the god Nārāyaṇa sāmans were sung 14. 25. 16-17 (Nī. on 14. 25. 16 Bom. Ed.: ṛcaḥ ‘tapa āsīd gṛhapatir’ (Tai. Br. 3. 12. 9. 3) ityādyāḥ…śaṁsanti yogayajñe pramāṇatvena kathayanti taittirīyādayaḥ/nārāyaṇavidaḥ vedavida ātmavido vā/nārāyaṇāya ātmaprāptyarthaṁ yat yadā paśūn indriyāṇi avindan vaśyatvena prāptavantaḥ); a sacrifice has seventeen constituents three of which are ṛcs, yajuses and sāmans (ṛco yajūṁṣi sāmāni…aṅgāny etāni yajñasya) 12. 260. 26. 

  E.   Ṛcs used for praising various deities: In this context ṛc does not always mean a stanza from the Ṛgveda, but also one similar to it, or a stanza in general: (1) Excellent Brāhmaṇas praised Indra with praises consisting of ṛcs, yajuses and sāmans (stūyamānaṁ dvijāgryaiś ca ṛgyajuḥsāmasaṁstavaiḥ) 3. 44. 18; (2) son of Ṛcīka (Śunaḥśepa), having praised with ṛcs gods who receive shares in sacrifices, became Viśvāmitra's son (ṛgbhiḥ stutvā mahābhāgo devān vai yajñabhāginaḥ) 12. 281. 13; (3) various sages (Asita Devala and others 12. 281. 15-16) praised Viṣṇu with ṛcs and obtained siddhi by practising tapas due to his favour (stutvā viṣṇum ṛgbhiḥ) 12. 281. 17; (4) Vyāsa, his pupils, and his son Śuka praised Hari with ṛcs from all the four Vedas (sa cāsmākam upādhyāyaḥ sahāsmābhir viśāṁ pate/caturvedodgatābhiś ca ṛgbhis tam abhituṣṭuve) 12. 327. 100; Vyāsa and other sages worshipped Kṛṣṇa with praises consisting of ṛcs, yajuses and sāmans (ṛgyajuḥsāmasaṁyuktair vacobhiḥ kṛṣṇam arcayan) 12. 52. 22; sages praised Madhusūdana with praises adorned with the contents of ṛcs (vāgbhir ṛgbhūṣitārthābhiḥ) 13. 126. 46; (5) Upamanyu, as directed by his teacher Dhaumya, praised Aśvins with the ṛc stanzas (1. 3. 60-70 which actually are not from the Ṛgveda) to regain his eye-sight (vāgbhir ṛgbhiḥ) 1. 3. 59; (6) Śiva is praised with ṛcs in Tantric rites by those who are versed in the Ṛgveda (ṛgbhir yam anuśaṁsanti tantre karmaṇi bahvṛcaḥ) (? bahvṛcāḥ)) 13. 16. 48; sages praised goddess Umā with praises adorned with the contents of the ṛcs (vāgbhir ṛgbhūṣitārthābhiḥ) 13. 128. 24. 

  F.   Their importance and utility limited: Sage Sanatsujāta told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that the chandas (ṛc), yajus and sāman did not save one from sin 5. 43. 1-3; the ṛcs, the sāmans and the yajuses have a beginning and therefore an end i. e. they are not eternal (12. 199. 16-18); the akṣara pada is not to be found in the ṛcs, yajuses, atharvans, and sāmans 5. 44. 21; even after studying the collections of the ṛcs and the sāmans, and the yajuses Bṛhaspati did not know the source of beings (ṛksāmasaṁghāṁś ca yajūṁṣi cāham… adhītya…bhūtaprakṛitṁ na vedmi) 12. 194. 8; mortals who believed in nondistinction (between brahman and ātman) having seen that the ṛcs, the sāmans, the yajuses and the prosperity desired (through them) was something distinct (from the highest self) (resorted) to tapas by practising austerities (apṛthagdharmiṇo martyā ṛksāmāni yajūṁṣi ca/kāmyāṁ puṣṭim pṛthag dṛṣṭvā tapobhis tapa eva ca) 12. 224. 63 (advaitaniṣṭhā martyās tapa eva yogam eva kṛtayuge 'nutiṣṭhantīti śeṣaḥ/ṛgādīni kāmyā iṣṭīś ca…pṛthak tapobhir ālocanaiḥ dṛṣṭvā…tat parityajya yogaparā eva babhūvur ity arthaḥ Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 232. 33); also cf. tapoyajñā dvijātayaḥ 12. 224. 61; all those who see the non-distinction (between pauruṣa karma daiva, and svabhāva 12. 230. 4-5), keep away (dṛṣṭvā = kṛtvā) their love and hatred for ṛcs, sāmans and yajuses, and practise tapas in the Kṛta age (apṛthagdarśinaḥ sarve ṛksāmasu yajuḥṣu ca/kāmadveśau pṛthag dṛṣṭvā tapaḥ kṛta upāsate) 12. 230. 8 (Nī. however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 238. 8: vedatraye 'pi bhedam apaśyantaḥ kāmyādīn (? kāmādīn) pṛthakkṛtya tapo jñānam upāsate śrayanti). [See  Ṛgveda ]

*3rd word in left half of page p234  (+offset) in original book.Aindrāstra  : (aindram astram) nt.: Name of a missile special to Indra; also known as Indrāstra, Māhendrāstra, Śakrāstra. 

  A.   Users: According to Bhīṣma, known to Arjuna and (perhaps) to Kṛṣṇa 6. 116. 38; but it was known to Droṇa 7. 166. 2; Mādhava (Sātyaki) learnt it from Vijaya (Arjuna) 6. 78. 39; it was once used even by Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 132. 32. 

  B.   Description: heavenly (divya) 4. 58. 8, an excellent missile (astravara 6. 55. 120; uttamāstra 6. 55. 111); bright like the sun (ādityasaṁkāśa) 4. 58. 8; extremely terrible (sughora) 6. 55. 110, 127; destructive like the end of the aeon (yugāntakalpa) 6. 55. 127. 

  C.   Mode of use: Certain mantras were recited over the bow, the bow-string, and the arrow at the time of releasing it (abhinyamantrayat 8. 66. 48; anumantrya 8. 66. 49), following certain prescriptions (vidhivat 6. 55. 110); the verb often used with regard to its use is ‘to bring forth, to manifest’ (prāduṣkṛ) 6. 55. 110; 7. 68. 21; 7. 132. 31, 32; 8. 19. 22; 8. 37. 31; (ud īraya) 6. 77. 40. 

  D.   Effect: Its primary effect was to produce a shower of arrows by releasing a single arrow 6. 55. 111, (120); 6. 77. 41; 6. 78. 37, 40; 7. 68. 21; 8. 19. 22; 8. 37. 31; 8. 66. 49; (4. 58. 9); the arrows became hard like vajra 3. 168. 2; the arrows (due to the effect of the mantras) became lustrous (tejomayā bāṇāḥ) 8. 66. 50, or appeared like bright fire (vimalāgnivarṇa) 6. 55. 111; when released the missile gave rise to a wonderful sight in the mid-region (prāduścakārādbhutam antarikṣe 6. 55. 110). 

  E.   Its use (principally by Arjuna): (1) In the epic war: (i) When Arjuna was attacked by Bhīṣma, Duryodhana, Bhūriśravas and Śalya, he put to use the Māhendra astra by forcefully drawing the Gāṇḍīva bow 6. 55. 106-110; (ii) when Arjuna was surrounded by thousands of kings (rājasahasrāṇi 6. 77. 32) and his normal arrows were not enough to ward off their arrows, Arjuna brought forth his Aindra astra and successfully repelled the arrows of the enemies 6. 77. 40-41; (iii) when Arjuna was attacked by Śrutāyus and Acyutāyus who showered arrows on the right and left of Arjuna and attacked him with tomara and śūla respectively, Arjuna manifested Śākra astra to take care of the weapons of the enemies and kill both of them 7. 68. 7-13, 21; (iii) when attacked by the Saṁśaptakas all together, Arjuna manifested Aindra astra to cut down all sorts of weapons of the enemies as also to cut off their limbs and chariots 8. 19. 22-29; (iv) when Arjuna was severely struck on his chest by Suśarman, he produced Aindra astra 8. 37. 30-31; (v) used by Arjuna to combat Karṇa's Brahmāstra 8. 66. 48-50; (vi) used by Arjuna to combat the Aindra astra used by Droṇa 7. 163. 28; (vii) used, together with Vāyavya, by Droṇa against Yudhiṣṭhira; the latter combated both of them with Māhendra astra 7. 132. 31, 32; (viii) used by Sātyaki to fight with the demon Alambusa; it reduced to ashes the māyā employed by the demon 6. 78. 40; (2) Outside the epic war: (i) During the cattle raid, when Arjuna was attacked by Kṛpa, Karṇa and Droṇa with heavenly missiles, Arjuna released the Aindra astra; he covered the enemies with arrows as the sun would do with his rays 4. 58. 8-9; (ii) when Arjuna was attacked by the Nīvātakavacas with showers of huge rocks, Arjuna released it (Indrāstra) and the vajra- like arrows released by the missile, pounded the rocks hurled by the enemies to pieces by hundreds 3. 168. 2. 

  F.   Status: Inferior to the Pāśupatāstra of Śiva 13. 14. 127.

*3rd word in left half of page p664  (+offset) in original book.Kuṇḍadhāra  : m.: Name of a cloud. 

  A.   Description: An attendant of gods (devānucara) 12. 263. 6; lustrous (kuṇḍadhārasya tejasā) 12. 263. 13; of great lustre (mahādyuti) 12. 263. 17, 20; of great fame (mahāyaśas) 12. 263. 27; magnanimous (mahātman) 12. 263. 7. 

  B.   Kuṇḍadhāra figures in an ancient narrative (itihāsaṁ purātanam) told by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira in reply to his question: What is most profitable among the three Puruṣārthas viz. dharma, artha and kāma (2. 263. 1-2); in the narrative, Kuṇḍadhāra obliges a Brāhmaṇa due to affection for his devotee (kuṇḍadhāreṇa yat prītyā bhaktāyopakṛtaṁ purā) 12. 263. 2-55; the narrative runs as follows: A certain poor Brāhmaṇa desired to obtain wealth in order to perform a sacrifice; he therefore worshipped many deities but did not get wealth; he then wondered which could be that one deity which would show him favour quickly; he then saw standing near him the cloud Kuṇḍadhāra (jaladharaṁ kuṇḍadhāraṁ st. 6) who appeared before him assuming an agreeable form (saumyena vapuṣā st. 6); the Brāhmaṇa felt assured by Kuṇḍadhāra's form and felt that he would definitely give him ample wealth; the Brāhmaṇa became his devotee and worshipped Kuṇḍadhāra with incenses, perfumes, garlands and oblations (tato dhūpaiś ca gandhaiś ca mālyair uccāvacair api/balibhiś cāpi…, st. 9); the cloud, satisfied, told the Brāhmaṇa that there were expiations for the sins committed due to killing a Brāhmaṇa, drinking wine, theft, breaking a vow, but there was no expiation for the sin of ungratefulness (kṛtaghne nāsti niṣkṛtiḥ st. 11); adharma was the child of craving, anger of envy, greed of insult (nikṛtyāḥ), and that an ungrateful person did not deserve progeny (kṛtaghno nārhati prajām st. 12); then the Brāhmaṇa, lying on the kuśa grass, due to the lustre (tejas) of Kuṇḍadhāra, saw in a dream (nidarśanam apaśyata st. 14), Maṇibhadra distributing kingdoms and wealth as desired by gods (maṇibhadraṁ vyādiśantam…/ tatra devāḥ prayacchanti rājyāni ca dhanāni ca st. 15-16); Kuṇḍadhāra fell at the feet of Maṇibhadra; Maṇibhadra, at the instance of gods, asked Kuṇḍadhāra what he desired; Kuṇḍadhāra replied that if the gods were satisfied with him they should show that kind of favour to the Brāhmaṇa which would lead him to happiness (asyānugraham icchāmi kṛtaṁ kiṁcit sukhodayam st. 19); again, at the instance of the gods, Maṇibhadra told Kuṇḍadhāra that he was willing to give the Brāhmaṇa as much wealth as desired by him; Kuṇḍadhāra then, reflecting that a man's (wealth) was fickle, decided to fix the Brāhmaṇa's mind on practising austerities (vicārya kuṇḍadhāras tu mānuṣaṁ calam adhruvam/ tapase matim ādhatta brāhmaṇasya yaśasvinaḥ) 12. 263. 22; Kuṇḍadhāra therefore told Maṇibhadra that he would not seek wealth for the Brāhmaṇa, but that the Brāhmaṇa be devoted to dharma; he desired that the Brāhmaṇa should take delight in dharma and should live following the dharma (bhaved eṣa tu dhārmikaḥ/dharme 'sya ramatāṁ buddhir dharmaṁ caivopajīvatu/) 12. 263. 25; when Maṇibhadra persisted on giving the Brāhmaṇa kingdom and various kinds of happiness since that was what one aspired to get by following dharma, Kuṇḍadhāra did not change his mind and wanted his Brāhmaṇa devotee to live following the dharma; the gods were pleased with him; Maṇibhadra told Kuṇḍadhāra that the gods were satisfied with him and that the Brāhmaṇa's mind would be fixed on dharma and that he would be a dharmātmā; Kuṇḍadhāra was delighted for having obtained what was desired in the form of a boon not easily obtained by others; the Brāhmaṇa saw thin garments around him but his mind was not deluded; abandoning them, he went to the forest and practised severe austerities; he felt that if he so desired he could certainly give some one even kingdom (12. 263. 30-39); at that juncture Kuṇḍadhāra again appeared before the Brāhmaṇa due to his friendship with him and the severe austerities performed by him; the Brāhmaṇa, surprised, received him according to the rites; Kuṇḍadhāra told the Brāhmaṇa that he had now obtained the highest divine insight (divyaṁ te cakṣur uttamam 12. 263. 42) and by using it the Brāhmaṇa should see the ultimate fate of the kings and the worlds they would get; then the Brāhmaṇa by his divine eye saw thousands of kings sunk in the hell; Kuṇḍadhāra wondered that if the Brāhmaṇa, after worshipping him was to get unhappiness, what kind of favour had he done to him ? He therefore asked the Brāhmaṇa (to use his divine eye and) to realize that it was futile to run after various longings because the door to heaven was closed for such men (kāmān icched kathaṁ naraḥ/svargadvāraṁ hi saṁruddhaṁ mānuṣeṣu viśeṣataḥ// 12. 263. 45); the Brāhmaṇa then saw that lust, anger, greed, fear, arrogance, sleep, drowsiness, laziness hinder men from going to heaven (tato 'paśyat sa kāmaṁ ca krodhaṁ lobhaṁ bhayaṁ madam/ nidrāṁ tandrīṁ tathālasyam āvṛtya puruṣān sthitān// 12. 263. 46); Kuṇḍadhāra again told the Brāhmaṇa that the vices, mentioned before, stopped men from going to heaven; gods were afraid of such men; (these vices), as ordained by the gods, create obstacles all around (tathaiva devavacanād vighnaṁ kurvanti sarvaśaḥ// 12. 263. 47); no one who was not permitted by gods could be virtuous; the Brāhmaṇa, due to his austerities, could confer kingdoms and wealth on others; the Brāhmaṇa fell at the feet of the cloud (toyadhāriṇe i. e. Kuṇḍadhāra) and told him that he had done a great favour to him; he requested Kuṇḍadhāra to forgive him for having formerly envied him (purā te yad asūyitam) due to his hankerings and greed; Kuṇḍadhāra embraced the Brāhmaṇa and told him that he had forgiven him and then disappeared; the Brāhmaṇa then roamed through the skies due to his austerities to which he was led by Kuṇḍadhāra; due to his virtuousness he also gained what he wanted and the highst bliss (vihāyasā ca gamanaṁ tathā saṁkalpitārthatā/dharmāc chaktyā tathā yogād yā caiva paramā gatiḥ//) 12. 263. 53.

*3rd word in left half of page p359  (+offset) in original book.Tripura  : nt.: Name of the three cities of the three Asuras. 

  A.   Creation: Created by Asura Maya for the three sons of Tāraka, viz. Tārākṣa (or Tārakākṣa), Kamalākṣa and Vidyunmālin; the cities were obtained by them as a boon from Pitāmaha; one of the three cities was made of gold, the other of silver, and the third of iron; they moved in them respectively in heaven, in mid region, and with the third, stationed on wheels, on the earth; (kāñcanaṁ divi tatrāsīd antarikṣe ca rājatam/āyasaṁ cābhavad bhūmau cakrasthaṁ pṛthivīpate//) 8. 24. 4, 10, 13-15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 8. 33. 18, however, cakrasthaṁ ājñāvaśaṁ yatheṣṭasaṁcārīty arthaḥ); (according to 13. 145. 24, however, all the three cities were in heaven (asurāṇāṁ purāṇy āsaṁs trīṇi vīryavatāṁ divi/āyasaṁ rājataṁ caiva sauvarṇam aparaṁ tathā//). 

  B.   Description: Inaccessible (durga) 8. 24. 20; guarded by Daityas and Dānavas (daityadānavarakṣita) 8. 24. 114. 

  C.   Characteristics: (1) The three cities were supposed to come together and be united at the end of one thousand years; if some prominent god were then to strike the cities with a single arrow, the god would be death for them (samāgatāni caitāni yo hanyād bhagavaṁs tadā/ekeṣuṇā devavaraḥ sa no mṛtyur bhaviṣyati//) 8. 24. 11-12; (2) Whatever was desired by a person who had taken shelter in the Tripuras (tripurasaṁśrayaḥ) was procured for him by Maya with the help of his māyā (tasmai kāmaṁ mayas taṁ taṁ vidadhe māyayā tadā) 8. 24. 22; (3) Hari, the son of Tārakākṣa, obtained as a boon from Pitāmaha, a well in their pura (vāpī bhavatu naḥ pure); if any demon, wounded by weapons, was thrown into this well, he arose from it stronger; if a dead demon was thrown into it, he came back alive (mṛtānāṁ jīvanīm); fortified with this well the denizens of the Tripuras oppressed all the three worlds 8. 24. 23-27. 

  D.   Mythological event: Since Indra was unable to shatter the Tripuras, although he used all his weapons against them, gods approached Rudra and requested him to destroy the demons and their cities; Śiva then burnt the three puras together with the demons, using gods as chariot (devān rathavaram kṛtvā), god Viṣṇu as arrow, Agni as tip of the arrow (śalya), Yama as hind part of the arrow (puṅkha); Śiva's arrow had three joints and three heads (to correspond to the three puras ?) (triparvaṇā triśalyena… śareṇa) 13. 145. 24-29; Śiva's chariot was driven in the direction of the Tripuras by Pitāmaha; Śiva employed his Pāśupata missile on his bow and thought of the Tripuras (tripuraṁ samacintayat) 8. 24. 115; at the appointed time the three puras came together and were united; when they came in his view, Śiva shot his arrow which burnt the Tripuras and the demons in them and threw them in the western ocean; thus Maheśvara, wishing well for the three worlds, burnt the Tripuras and the demons 8. 24. 114-121; this report in the Karṇaparvan of the downfall of the Tripuras which was according to the account in the Purāṇas is referred to in the Anukramaṇīparvan (ākhyātaṁ yatra paurāṇaṁ tripurasya nipātanam) 1. 2. 169. 

  E.   Similies: (1) The town Saubha, when cut into two by the Sudarśanacakra of Kṛṣṇa, fell down as did the Tripura when tossed up by the arrow of Maheśvara (maheśvaraśaroddhūtaṁ papāta tripuraṁ yathā) 3. 23. 34; (2) Aśvatthāman, after burning an akṣauhiṇī army of the demons (of Ghaṭotkaca), shone as Maheśvara formerly did in heaven after burning the Tripura (pureva tṛipuraṁ dagdhvā divi devo maheśvaraḥ) 7. 131. 98; (3) The same simile is found when Karṇa killed the demons (of Ghaṭotkaca) 7. 150. 83.

  It forms the basis for the words addressed by Draupadī to Yudhiṣṭthira 3. 33. 3-55; it was told by a Brāhmaṇa to Drupada who happened to be the latter's guest; the nīti was then taught by Drupada to his sons; Draupadī listened to their talk (sāṁkathya), and as she approached her father on some business and sat on his lap with a desire to listen, he told it to her 3. 33. 56-58; the nīti lays stress on action (karma khalv iha kartavyaṁ jātenāmitrakarśana) 3. 33. 3; the nīti admits three causes of a man's obtaining anything: haṭha- obstinacy (in not doing anything, yet getting something by chance 3. 33. 13-14), daiva- fate (15), and karman-one's own action (16); one also gets some other things for no effort while striving for a single purpose--this is due to the nature of the act performed by him (svabhāvātmakaṁ phalam 17); (evaṁ haṭhāc ca daivāc ca svabhāvāt karmaṇas tathā) 3. 33. 18; (kiṁcid daivād dhaṭhāt kiṁcit kiṁcid eva svakarmataḥ/puruṣaḥ phalam āpnoti caturthaṁ nātra kāraṇam//) 3. 33. 32.

*3rd word in left half of page p265  (+offset) in original book.Yajus  : nt. (sg. or pl.): Sacrificial prose formula from the Yajurveda; when used in plural it stands also for the Yajurveda; when in plural, it mostly occurs with ṛcs and sāmans. 

  A.   Gift of Āditya to Yājñavalkya: The sage Yājñavalkya told king Janaka that while he was practising the prescribed rite, (although) he was despised (? avamatena), he propitiated the god Sun with severe austerity; he then received from Āditya the yajuses (yathārṣeṇeha vidhinā caratāvamatena ha/mayādityād avāptāni yajūṁṣi mithilādhipa//mahatā tapasā devas tapiṣṭhaḥ sevito mayā) 12. 306. 2-3; when the pleased god Sūrya offered a boon to Yājñavalkya, the latter requested the god to grant him the yajuses which had not been used before (? yajūṁṣi nopayuktāni kṣipram icchāmi veditum) 12. 306. 4-5; the god agreed to Yājñavalkya's request; Sarasvatī then in the form of speech entered Yājñavalkya's mouth 12. 306. 6-7; the God said that as a result of that, the whole of Veda (i. e. the Yajurveda) together with its latter half and the khila would be established in him (Yājñavalkya) (pratiṣṭhāsyati te vedaḥ sottaraḥ sakhilo dvijā) 12. 306. 10 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 318. 10: khilaṁ paraśākhīyaṁ svaśākhyāyām apekṣāvaśāt paṭhyate tat khilam ity ucyate/…sakhilam tatsahitam/ sottaraṁ sopaniṣatkam/); Yājñavalkya received fifteen yajuses from Arka (Sūrya) (daśa pañca ca prāptāni yajūṁṣy arkān mayānagha) 12. 306. 21; Sūrya gave the yajuses (to Yājñavalkya) in the east (atra (i. e. in the east) dattāni sūryeṇa yajūṁṣi) 5. 106. 11 (Nī on Bom. Ed. 5. 108. 11: yājñavalkyāyeti śeṣaḥ). 

  B.   Relationship with deities: Nārāyaṇa has his abode in the ṛcs, the yajuses and the sāmans (ṛgyajuḥsāmadhāmānam) 12. 47. 27; Bhīṣma while praising Kṛṣṇa-Nārāyaṇa said that he was of the nature of a stotra and, as a bird named Yajus, had metres for its limbs, Trivṛt (stoma) for its head, and Rathantara and Bṛhatī sāmans for its eyes (yaḥ suparṇo yajur nāma chandogātras trivṛcchirāḥ/rathantarabṛhatyakṣas tasmai stotrātmane namaḥ//) 12. 47. 28; (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 47. 44: suparṇaḥ vedapuruṣaḥa yajur iti yasya nāma chandāṁsi gāyatryādīnī yasya gātrāṇi hastādīni/trivṛt tribhir ṛgyajuḥsāmabhir vartata iti yogād yajñāḥ sa eva śiro yasya/ yasya rathantaraṁ bṛhac ca vaikalpikaṁ sāma prītivākyam); (2) Upamanyu while praising Śiva said that he was Śatarudriya among the yajuses 13. 14. 159. 

  C.   yajus and sacrifice (real or metaphorical): The sage Taṇḍi while prasing Mahādeva said that the Adhvaryu priests give offerings to him in sacrifice with the repetition of yajus formulae 13. 16. 48; Trita, fallen in a well, mentally thought of the ṛcs, the yajuses and the sāmans for offering a Soma sacrifice (ṛco yajūṁṣī sāmāni manasā cintayan muniḥ) 9. 35. 33; the Yakṣa asked Yudhiṣṭhira: “which is the one yajus suited for sacrifice ?” (kim ekaṁ yajñyaṁ yajuḥ); the reply was: “mind is the (one) yajus suitable for sacrifice” (mano vai yajñiyaṁ yajuḥ) 3. 297. 34-35; one who dwells in a forest (vānaprasthāśrame vaset 12. 236. 5) should, till death, give five (offerings) to the prāṇas in the three fires in himself with the yajus formula, (and) eat six (morsels) without criticizing (the food) 12. 236. 25 (trīṁs caivāgnīn yajet samyag ātmany evātmamokṣaṇāt (?)/prāṇebhyo yajuṣā pañca ṣaṭ prāśnīyād akutsayan// Nī., however, on Bom.

  D.   yajus and meateating: One who eats meat which is sanctified by the yajus formula (i. e. sacrificial meat) incurs no sin (yajuṣā saṁskṛtaṁ māṁsam upabhuñjan na duṣyati) 13. 148. 17; consecration by the yajus formula is extended even to ordinary food which does not involve killing (nātmārthaṁ pācayed annaṁ na vṛthā ghātayet paśūn/prāṇī vā yadi vāprāṇī saṁskāraṁ yajuṣārhati) 12. 235. 5 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 243. 6: prāṇī chāgādiḥ aprāṇī aśvathādiḥ yajuṣā chedanamantreṇaiva kratvartham eva saṁskāram arhati na tu bhakṣaṇamātrārtham); according to 12. 186. 13, however, one who has abstained from meat should not eat (even) meat which is sanctified by the yajus formula (i. e. should not eat even sacrificial meat) (yajuṣā saṁskṛtaṁ māṁsam nivṛtto māṁsabhakṣaṇāt/na bhakṣayet; Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 193. 14: yajuṣā yajurvedavidādhvaryuṇā māṁsam yajñyam api nivṛtto na bhakṣayet). 

  E.   The study of ṛcs, yajuses and sāmans: One who does not know the ṛcs, the yajuses and the sāmans is to be considered as a calamity brought about by Prajāpati (anṛgyajur asāmā tu prājāpatya upadravaḥ) 12. 60. 42 (Commentator Vimalabodha: anṛgyajur asāmā ṛgvedādiśūnyaḥ prājāpatya upadravaḥ vidhātṛkṛta upadravaḥ upaghātaḥ/ evaṁvidho brāhmaṇo niṣphalajanmeti bhāvaḥ cited in the footnote to the stanza in the Cr.

  F.   Personified: Yajuses in thousands in the bodily form attended the sacrifice of Mahādeva who had assumed the body of Varuṇas 13. 85. 4. 

  G.   Limitations: Hanūmān told Bhīma that in the Kṛta age there were no sāmans, yajuses and ṛcs (nāsan kṛtayuge tāta…na sāmayajuṛgvarṇāḥ) 3. 148. 12-13 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 149. 14: trayīdharmasya cittaśuddhyarthatvāt tasyāś ca tadānīm svabhāvasiddhatvān na sāmādīny āsan) [for other information on yajus which is common to the ṛcs, the yajuses and the sāmans see Ṛc above].

*3rd word in left half of page p208  (+offset) in original book.Rāhu  : m.: Name of a planet, also called  Svarbhānu  (6. 13. 39-40; 13. 17. 37). 

  A.   Description: Described as round (parimaṇḍala) 6. 13. 40; fierce (tīvra) 6. 3. 26; dark (śyāma) 6. 3. 15; blazing, (prajvalita) 6. 3. 15; having smoke and fire sadhūmaḥ sahapāvakaḥ) 6. 3. 15; having copper-red crest (? tāmraº ºśikha) 6. 3. 24. 

  B.   Importance: Chief among the planets (grahapatir varaḥ) 13. 17. 37; Rāhu, along with other planets, visits the sabhā of Brahman 2. 11. 20, 19; Rāhu, not directly named but probably referred to as Grahapati, finds place in the list of a thousand names of Śiva (ketugraho grahapatir varaḥ) 13. 17. 37 (however, Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 17. 38, interprets grahaḥ as rāhuḥ: ketuś ca prasiddhaḥ/candrākrau gṛhṇātīti graho rāhuḥ/ grahāṇāṁ patiḥ [grahapatiḥ] krūratvāt maṁgalaḥ); Rāhu finds place also in the Daivatavaṁśa 13. 151. 12. 

  C.   Measurement: Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya to tell him complete extent (sarvaṁ (pramāṇaṁ)) of Rāhu, to which Saṁjaya agreed 6. 12. 3-4; according to the information of Saṁjaya his diameter (viṣkambha) was 12000 yojanas, and his circumference (pariṇāha) 36000 yojanas; according to the learned Paurāṇikas his expanse (? vipulatva) was 6000 yojanas (parimaṇḍalo mahārāja svarbhānuḥ śrūyate grahaḥ/yojanānāṁ sahasrāṇi viṣkambho dvādaśāsya vai//pariṇāhena ṣaṭtriṁśad vipulatvena cānagha/ ṣaṣṭim āhuḥ śatāny asya budhāḥ paurāṇikās tathā) 6. 13. 40-41 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 12. 41 interprets vipulatvena as tato 'py ādhikyena, idam uttarānvayi; in that case the circumference of Rāhu will be 36000 + 6000 = 42000 yojanas; see also Editor's note on the stanza, Cr. Ed. Vol. 7, p. 765: “Saṁjaya is here relying upon his studies, and not upon the Eye Divine”); owing to its being larger in size than the sun and the moon, Rāhu covers them both at proper times (sa rāhuś chādayaty etau (i. e. candrādityau) yathākālaṁ mahattayā) 6. 13. 45. 

  D.   Omens: (1) Among the bad omens for the Kurus reported by Vyāsa to Dhṛtarāṣṭra one was related to Rāhu's swallowing the sun 6. 3. 11; this event is again referred to by Vyāsa as occurring at an improper time, i. e. on the thirteenth day of the month and in which Rāhu swallowed both Candra and Sūrya together; this meant destruction of the subjects 6. 3. 28-29 (for citation and Nī.'s commentary see  Sūrya  below); also cf. 14. 76. 15; 2. 71. 26; 9. 55. 10; the same was also noted by Karṇa and reported to Kṛṣṇa (rāhur arkam upaiṣyati) 5. 141. 10 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 143. 11: ayaṁ kartarīyogaḥ somavaṁśyānāṁ sūryavaṁśyānāṁ ca rājñāṁ kṣayakara ity arthaḥ); (reference to Rāhu implied in 6. 73. 10: prajāsaṁharaṇe sūryaḥ krūrair iva mahāgrahaiḥ (parivṛtaḥ); (2) Among the omens noticed by Vyāsa there was also another according to which a black planet (= Rāhu) blazing, and full of smoke and fire had gone over to Jyeṣṭhā and remained there (śyāmo grahaḥ prajvalitaḥ sadhūmaḥ sahapāvakaḥ/…jyeṣṭhām ākramya tiṣṭhati//)) 6. 3. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 3. 16 reads śveto grahaḥ in place of śyāmo grahaḥ and explains it as Ketu: śveto dvitīya upagrahaḥ ketusaṁjñaḥ); (3) Vyāsa had also noticed that the two Grahas (Rāhu and Ketu ?) having copper-red and ruddy crests (respy. ?) appear blazing in the sky and cover up the lustre of the seven sages (i. e. the constellation Ursa Major) (grahau tāmrāruṇaśikhau prajvalantāv iva sthitau/saptar ṣīṇām udārāṇāṁ samavacchādya vai prabhām//) 6. 3. 24; (4) Kṛṣṇa observed that the amāvāsyā had already set in on the thirteenth day of the dark half of the month and that Rāhu had turned the fourteenth day into the fifteenth (which was looked upon as bad); he told the Yādavas that such an event had happened only once before at the time of the Bhārata war (a reference to 6. 3. 28-29 above) and that it had now occurred again to foretell the destruction of the Yādavas (trayodaśyām amāvāsyā tān dṛṣṭvā prābravīd idam//caturdaśī pañcadaśī kṛteyaṁ rāhuṇā punaḥ/tadā ca bhārate yuddhe prāptā cādya kṣayāya naḥ//) 16. 3. 16-17 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 16. 2. 19, notices a hint of a solar eclipse in this statement: evaṁ saty agrimapakṣe vṛddhyā bhāvyaṁ tan na jātaṁ praty uta ekā tithiḥ kṣīṇā tatra grahaṇaṁ ca jātam).

Origin: Three accounts: (1) when the Kāleya demons, under the leadership of Vṛtra, attacked Indra and the other gods, Brahman advised them to approach the sage Dadhīca and ask him for his bones in order to fashion a Vajra out of it; with that Vajra, Indra was to kill Vṛtra 3. 98. 3-11; when the gods received the bones of Dadhīca, they took them to Tvaṣṭṛ and asked him to fashion a Vajra out of the bones; Tvaṣṭṛ, ritually ready (prayata) to receive the bones, was glad to fashion the Vajra which he did with great effort (prayatnāt) 3. 98. 22; when the Vajra was ready, Tvaṣṭṛ asked Indra to reduce his enemies to ashes with the excellent Vajra (vajrapravara); Indra too was happy and ritually ready (prayata) to receive it 3. 98. 23-24; (2) Vajra created from the bones of Dadhīca in order to kill the three-headed Viśvarūpa, son of Tvaṣṭṛ; when the Vajra was fashioned by Dhātṛ, Viṣṇu entered it (viṣṇupraviṣṭa); with the Vajra, thus fortified, Indra cut off the heads of Viśvarūpa 12. 329. 25-27; 1. 127. 12; (3) during a conflict between the gods and the demons Indra searched the three worlds for a suitable weapon, but did not find it; he asked the gods to approach the sage Dadhīca to ask for his bones; when the bones were received, Indra got prepared out of them various divine missiles like vajras (pl.), discuses, maces, and heavy daṇḍas (kārayām āsa divyāni nānāpraharaṇāny uta/vajrāṇi cakrāṇi gadā gurudaṁḍāṁś ca puṣkalān); with this Vajra produced from the lustre of a Brāhmaṇa (Dadhīca) and employed with the recitation of the mantras (tena vajreṇa… mantrayuktena…brahmatejobhavena ca), Indra killed nine times ninety (navatīr nava 9. 50. 33) Daityas and Dānavas 9. 50. 25-33.

  D.   Use by Indra: 1. Incidents related to the epic: (i) Indra released his lustrous missile (svam astram asṛjad dīptam), not named, against Arjuna at the time of the Khāṇḍava fire; it produced lightnings; Arjuna repelled it by Vāyavya astra 1. 218. 13, 15-16; Indra took up a thunderbolt (aśani, mahāśani), and, charging it with Vajra missile, released it against Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna (aśaniṁ gṛhya tarasā vajram astram avāsṛjat), and told the gods that the two were killed 1. 218. 29-30; Kṛṣṇa paralysed Indra who wanted to strike him with Vajra (reference to the Khāṇḍava fire ?) 13. 143. 26, 23; (ii) when Indra could not dissuade Uttaṅka from desisting to dig the earth with just a stick, he joined his Vajrāstra with the stick; the earth, torn asunder by the strokes of Vajra, made way for Uttaṅka to go to the Nāgaloka 14. 57. 31-32; 2. Incidents not related to the epic: (i) Indra threatened king Marutta, first through Agni, that in case the king did not forsake Saṁvarta who acted as his priest at the sacrifice, he would hurl his Vajra at him 14. 9. 24; he again threatened Marutta, through the Gandharva Dhṛtarāṣṭra, that he would use his Vajra against the king 14. 10. 1, 2, 4, 7; Saṁvarta, however, assured Marutta that if Indra with his Vajra arrived to strike the king, he would paralyse Indra, and that he had destroyed before the weapons of all the gods; Saṁvarta then said: “let the wind blow and may it drive away the Vajra to the directions; let there be rain and may it fall on the forests; let waters float in the midregion and let there be lightning in the sky (diśo vajraṁ vrajatāṁ vāyur etu varṣaṁ bhūtvā nipatatu kānaneṣu/āpaḥ plavantv antarikṣe vṛthā ca saudāminī dṛśyatāṁ mā bibhas tvam//) 14. 10. 13; (vajraṁ tathā sthāpayatāṁ ca vāyuḥ) 14. 10. 14; Marutta was still afraid of the sound of Vajra and of the winds, and then Saṁvarta again assured the king that he would become wind and strike down the Vajra to dispel the king's fear 14. 10. 15-16; (ii) Indra asked his missile Vajra in the bodily form (mūrtisaṁsthita) to turn into a tiger and kill Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin, son of king Sṛñjaya, as he was afraid of the prince's growing strength 12. 31. 27-28; when Vajra (vajraḥ) was so addressed, he began to look for a suitable opportunity and when it arrived he, as tiger, killed Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin; after killing the prince, the tiger disappeared by the māyā of Indra 12. 31. 29-34; (iii) when the sage Cyavana wanted to offer Soma to Aśvinā Indra objected to it; in spite of the objection, when Cyavana was about to fill the cup for the Aśvinā, Indra threatened Cyavana to strike him with Vajra; when Cyavana still proceeded to fill the cup, and Indra was about to strike the Vajra, Cyavana paralysed Indra's arm 3. 124. 8, 15-17; 14. 9. 31-32; 12. 329. 14(3); 3. Mythological incidents: (i) Vṛtra episode: (a) in the battle between the gods and Vṛtra, helped by the Kālakeyas, Indra released his Vajra to kill Vṛtra; when struck by the Vajra, Vṛtra was killed 3. 99. 1-3, 13-14; however, Indra felt as if he had not released the Vajra from his hand and that Vṛtra was not killed 3. 99. 15; (b) when the gods approached Viṣṇu for his help in their fight against Vṛtra, Viṣṇu advised them to establish peace for the time being with Vṛtra, and when the proper time came he would enter the Vajra of Indra 5. 10. 11-12; Vṛtra was ready to make peace if he would not be attacked by Indra or by the gods with anything that was dry or wet, which was stone or wood, which was a weapon (śastra) or Vajra, and if they would strike neither by day nor by night 5. 10. 29; Indra killed Vṛtra with foam which was fortified with Vajra; Viṣṇu had entered that foam (savajram atha phenaṁ taṁ kṣipraṁ vṛtre nisṛṣṭavān/praviśya phenaṁ taṁ viṣṇur atha vṛtraṁ vyanāśayat) 5. 10. 38; 3. 299. 15; (c) Maheśvara told Indra to kill Vṛtra with Vajra; Indra agreed 12. 272. 38-39; in the fight that ensued, Indra came with Vajra in his hand; he struck Vṛtra with Vajra; the Vajra (m.) killed him; Viṣṇu had entered the Vajra 12. 273. 5-7, 9; 12. 272. 31; 12. 274. 2; (d) in the fight between Indra and Vṛtra, when the latter covered the earth, Indra released his Vajra at him; Vṛtra then entered successively water, fire, wind, and then ran to ether (ākāśa); each time Indra struck him with Vajra; finally Vṛtra entered Śakra (Indra); in that condition Indra struck Vṛtra with an invisible Vajra (adṛśyena vajreṇa) 14. 11. 6-19; (ii) Viśvarūpa-Triśiras episode: (a) when the gods led by Indra approached god Brahman complaining that Viśvarupa (Triśiras), son of Tvaṣṭṛ, drank away all Soma offered in sacrifices, and that they were left without a share, Brahman advised them to approach the sage Dadhīca and request him to give up his body; the gods should then fashion a Vajra from the bones of Dadhīca 12. 329. 24-25; when Dadhīca gave up his body, Dhātṛ fashioned a Vajra out of the bones; with that Vajra, produced from the bones of a Brāhmaṇa and in which god Viṣṇu had entered, Indra killed Viśvarūpa and cut off his heads 12. 329. 27; (b) when Indra failed to tempt Triśiras, son of Tvaṣṭṛ, with Apsarases while he was practising penance, he decided to strike Vajra at him; when struck by Vajra, Triśiras fell down like the summit of a mountain; Indra was still afraid of Triśiras and he asked a woodcutter (takṣan) to cut off the heads of the lying Triśiras assuring Takṣan that he would make his axe Vajra-like (matprasādād dhi te śastraṁ vajrakalpaṁ bhaviṣyati 5. 9. 27); the woodcutter finally cut off the heads of Triśiras with his axe 5. 9. 15-34; (iii) Meeting of Bali and Indra: when Indra met Bali in the form of a donkey (khara 12. 216. 12), Bali told Indra that he could fell down Indra with his fist although Indra was equipped with Vajra, but that that was the time to show forbearance (kṣamā) and not valour (vikrama) 12. 217. 38-39; 12. 220. 79-80; Indra told Bali that since he was asked by god Brahman not to kill Bali, he was not releasing his Vajra at him (Bali) (12. 218. 33); Indra asked Bali why he was not grieved although he was formerly struck by Vajra 12. 220. 18; Bali told Indra that he was not afraid of him (Indra) although he saw him with his Vajra raised (vajram udyamya tiṣṭhantam) 12. 220. 21; Indra was surprised at the tranquility of Bali for he was not afraid of Indra with Vajra raised in his hand 12. 220. 89; (iv) Garuḍa episode: on his way to fetch amṛta, when Garuḍa flew to the mountain whose caves were blocked with snow, there were bad omens for the gods; Indra's dear missile Vajra blazed with pain (indrasya vajraṁ dayitaṁ prajajvāla vyathānvitam) 1. 26. 28; when Garuḍa was taking away amṛta, Indra struck him with Vajra; Garuḍa smiled and told Indra that just out of respect for the sage (Dadhīca) from whose bones the Vajra was fashioned, out of respect for Vajra itself, and Indra, he would let fall just one of his feathers; otherwise, due to the blow of the missile, he felt no pain at all; surprised, Indra sought friendship with Garuḍa 1. 29. 17-23; (v) Fight between the gods and Skanda: when during the fight between the gods and Skanda, the gods abandoned Indra, he released his Vajra at Skanda; it struck Skanda on his right side and split it open; due to the impact of Vajra was produced another young man (puruṣo 'paraḥ/yuvā) with golden armour, wearing heavenly kuṇḍalas, and holding śakti; he became Viśākha since he was produced due to vajraviśana (yad vajraviśanāj jāto viśākhas tena so 'bhavat) 3. 216. 1214 [viśana ‘opening made by the Vajra’ ? Nīla.: ‘digging up of the arm’ bāhor ākhananāt Bom. Ed. 3. 227. 17]; (vi) Śiva and Indra: (a) Śiva, in the form of a child in the lap of Umā, froze the arm of Śakra which held Vajra (since apparently Indra wanted to strike Vajra at the child not realising that the child was Śiva); when Brahmā and the other gods propitiated Śiva (Rudra) and Umā, Indra's hand, holding the Vajra, became as before 7. 173. 60-63; 13. 145. 30-34; (b) Indra once desirous to have Maheśvara's glory hurled his Vajra at him; it burnt Maheśvara's throat and departed; that is why Śiva is called Śrīkaṇṭha (tena śrīkaṇṭhatā mama; Nīla. śrakaṇṭhatā = nīlakaṇṭhatā on Bom. Ed. 13. 127. 47) 13. 128. 8; (vii) Indra and Mandara: Mandara, son of Hiraṇyakaśipu, fought with Indra for a million years; due to the boon he had obtained from Mahādeva (Śiva) Indra's Vajra was shattered on the limbs of the “tormentor” (graha ?) Mandara 13. 14. 53-54 (Nī. grahasya mandāranāmnaḥ on Bom. Ed. 13. 14. 75). 

  E.   Knowledge of Vajra by Arjuna and its use by him: Arjuna learnt (adhītavān) the Vajra missile from Indra (and other missiles from Yama, Kubera, and Varuṇa) 3. 89. 12; (i) Mātali advised Arjuna to use Indra's favourite missile against the Nivātakavaca demons; Arjuna released (udīraya-) it after resorting to a firm place (acalaṁ sthānam āsādya) and after reciting the mantras on the Gāṇḍīva bow (gāṇḍīvam anumantrya ca); the result was that the sharp, iron arrows released from his bow had the impact of Vajra (amuñcaṁ vajrasaṁsparsān āyasān niśitāñ śarān); the arrows, propelled by the Vajra and which had themselves become Vajra-like (te vajracoditā bāṇā vajrabhūtāḥ) pierced the māyās of the demons and the demons themselves; they all fell down on the ground when struck by the impact (vega) of Vajra; the arrows killed also those demons who had entered the ground 3. 169. 12-17; (ii) Arjuna used the Vajra missle to kill the Saṁśaptaka warriors who showered arrows at Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna to completely cover them 7. 26. 19-20. 

  F.   As standard of comparison; Various things compared with Vajra: 1. arrows: of Arjuna 6. 114. 55, 57; 7. 68. 56; 7. 78. 10; 8. 21. 32; 8. 55. 3; 8. 67. 16; 14. 73. 29; 14. 78. 27; of Arjuna and Karṇa 8. 65. 7; of Sātyaki 7. 91. 20; 7. 94. 14; 7. 95. 42; of Abhimanyu 6. 75. 24; of the Pāṇḍya king 8. 15. 8; of Droṇa 7. 72. 30; of Bhūriśravas 6. 70. 9; of Aśvasena 7. 171. 49; 2. gadā: of Bhīma 6. 58. 34; 7. 109. 11; 7. 110. 13 (gadā not mentioned); 7. 152. 27; of Sātyaki 7. 169. 19; of Karṇa 8. 27. 29; 3. cakra of Kṛṣṇa 6. 55. 86; 4. musala: 16. 4. 35, 39, 37 (erakā); 5.

  G.   Its use for punishment and not as a missile: (1) Sudhanvan warned Prahlāda that if, in reply to a question, he told what was false, Indra would pound his head with Vajra into hundred pieces 2. 61. 63; (2) Bṛhaspati told the gods what had been proclaimed by Brahman in ancient times (purā gītaṁ brahmaṇā 5. 12. 18): if one hands over to the enemy the person who has sought refuge, the gods with Indra strike him with Vajra 5. 12. 21. 

  H.   Status: The best among the weapons (āyudhānāṁ varo vajraḥ (m.)) 4. 2. 13; an object of worship and honour: (i) when Vajra struck Vṛtra's head, it (the Vajra) was shattered into ten, and then into hundred pieces; the gods shared the pieces of Vajra among themselves and worshipped them; (ii) whatever is efficacious in the world is supposed to have the built of Vajra (loke yat sādhanaṁ kiṁcit sā vai vajratanuḥ smṛtā 1. 158. 48); hence a Brāhmaṇa's hand is considered to be made of Vajra, a Kṣatriya has his chariot of Vajra, a Vaiśya's gift is as efficacious as Vajra, and those junior to a Vaiśya (the Śūdras) are supposed to have Vajra's strength in their service; the horses of a Kṣatriya are as good as Vajra and hence they are inviolable (vajrapāṇir brāhmaṇaḥ syāt kṣatraṁ vajrarathaṁ smṛtam/ vaiśyā vai dānavajrāś ca karmavajrā yavīyasaḥ//vajraṁ kṣatrasya vājino avadhyā vājinaḥ smṛtāḥ) 1. 158. 49-50; however, Vajra made ineffectual when Nīlakaṇṭha (Śiva) granted a boon to Nārāyaṇa that Vajra will not have any effect on him 7. 172. 77-78.

Ed. 1. 212. 6, reads prasthe which he explains as śikhare); Tilottamā approached the two demons there; in the duel that followed between the two over Tilottamā, both were killed on the mountain 1. 204. 6, 10, 19; (4) The mountain Vindhya, angry with the sun, began to grow upwards, but, at the instance of the sage Agastya, stopped growing (vacas tavānatikrāman vindhyaḥ śailo na vardhate) 3. 101. 15; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Lomaśa why Vindhya suddenly started to grow 3. 102. 1; Vindhya asked the sun to make a pradakṣiṇā round him as it did round Meru; the sun told the mountain that he did not do it at his own will, but that was the course laid down by the Creator; when the sun did not oblige, Vindhya, angered, began to grow and obstructed the path of the sun and the moon; the gods tried to stop him from growing but Vindhya did not stop; the gods then approached Agastya and told him that Vindhya, under the influence of anger, was covering the path of the luminaries; they added that no one else except the sage was able to dissuade the mountain; hearing that Agastya, in the company of his wife, approached Vindhya and told him that he wanted to go to the south on some purpose; he asked the mountain to wait for his return and grow again as desired after he returned; Agastya made this contract with Vindhya but never returned from the south; Vindhya was thus made to stop growing due to the power of Agastya (evaṁ sa samayaṁ kṛtvā vindhyenāmitrakarśana/adyāpi dakṣiṇād deśād vāruṇir na nivartate//etat te sarvam ākhyātaṁ yathā vindhyo na vardhate/agastyasya prabhāvena (sic)) 3. 102. 3-14; (5) Vindhya, along with other mountains, arrived for the abhiṣeka of Kumāra (Skanda) 9. 44. 13, 16; Vindhya presented his two companions Ucchrita and Atiśṛṅga, who fought with big rocks, to Skanda (mahāpāṣāṇayodhinau/pradadāv agniputrāya vindhyaḥ pāriṣadāv ubhau) 9. 44. 45.

Ed. 1. 221. 81: parapraharaṇajñāne śatrukṛtaprahāravedanāyāṁ vindhya iva nirvijñāna iti prativindhyaḥ).

  E.

after receiving their gifts, Yudhiṣṭhira honoured the great warriors of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (vṛṣṇyandhakamahārathān); the best among the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (vṛṣṇyandhakottamāḥ) lived happily with Kurus and enjoyed with them great drinking bouts (mahāpānair…vijahruḥ kuruvṛṣṇayaḥ); then, after many days, the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka warriors (uttamavīryās te), led by Balarāma, returned to Dvārakā taking with them bright jewels given to them by Kurus 1. 213. 52-56; (7) Vṛṣṇi princes (vṛṣṇīnāṁ…kumārā…) were among those who waited on Dharmarāja in his Sabhā 2. 4. 26;

even women could fight and hold it against the attack (striyo 'pi yasyāṁ yudhyeyuḥ kiṁ punar vṛṣṇipuṁgavāḥ 2. 13. 51); Vṛṣṇis lived there without fear from any quarter (akutobhayāḥ); although powerful, they had allied themselves with Pāṇḍavas because of their relationship (sāmarthyavantaḥ sambandhād bhavantaṁ samupāśritāḥ); Cārudeṣṇa and all other Vṛṣṇi heroes though free from grief, lived at Kuśasthalī still remembering the Madhyadeśa (where they formerly lived) (smaranto madhyamaṁ deśaṁ vṛṣṇimadhye gatavyathāḥ) 2. 13. 53, 59; (10) Jarāsandha was neglected by Vṛṣṇis, though strong, out of considerations of policy (balibhiḥ …vṛṣṇibhiś ca…nītihetor upekṣitaḥ) 2. 17. 27; (11) Vṛṣṇis arrived at Khāṇḍavaprastha for the Rājasūya of Yudhiṣṭhira 2. 31. 16; (12) Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas did not pay tribute to Yudhiṣṭhira for Rājasūya because of their friendly relations with Pāṇḍavas (sakhyenāndhakavṛṣṇayaḥ) 2. 48. 42; however, Vārṣṇeyas are said to have brought for Yudhiṣṭhira many kinds of tribute (vārṣṇeyān hārahūṇāṁś ca …balyarthaṁ dadatas tasmai nānārūpān anekaśaḥ) but were stopped at the gate 2. 47. 19-20, 25; the tribute is described in 2. 47. 21-25 (since Vārṣṇeyas are here listed along with Cīnas, Hūṇas, Śakas, Oḍras, forest-dwellers, and Hārahūṇas, are these Vārṣṇeyas different from Vṛṣṇis who formed a section of the Yādavas and did not pay tribute ?): (13) Śiśupāla instigated the kings assembled for the Rājasūya to fight with Vṛṣṇis and Pāṇḍavas 2. 36. 14; (14) Vidura warned Kauravas that Vṛṣṇis would never forgive the hardship suffered by Draupadī in the Sabhā (tasyāḥ…parikleśaṁ na kṣaṁsyante…/vṛṣṇayo vā maheṣvāsāḥ) 2. 72. 29; (15) Hearing that Pāṇḍavas had gone into exile, Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas, and Andhakas went to meet them in the Dvaitavana (3. 12. 68); they sat around Yudhiṣṭhira, blamed Kauravas and wondered what they could do (to help them) 3. 13. 1, 3-4; (16) Draupadī complained to Kṛṣṇa that Kauravas had desired to reduce her to the status of a dāsī although Vṛṣṇis were alive (dāsībhāvena bhoktuṁ mām īṣus te madhusūdana/jīvatsu…atha vṛṣṇiṣu) 3. 13. 56; 5. 80. 25; (17) When Śālva attacked Dvārakā in the absence of Kṛṣṇa, young Vṛṣṇi heroes fought with him (bālakair vṛṣṇipuṁgavaiḥ); Śālva killed many of the excellent Vṛṣṇi heroes (vṛṣṇipravīrāṁs tān bālān hatvā) 3. 15. 6-7; during Śālva's attack on Dvārakā drinking liquor was prohibited; Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas had to remain alert apprehending Śālva might attack them when they were drunk (pramatteṣv abhighātaṁ hi kuryāt …iti kṛtvāpramattās te sarve vṛṣṇyandhakāḥ sthitāḥ//) 3. 16. 12-13; it was then ruled that no one in the town of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas could leave or enter the town without valid permit (na cāmudro 'bhiniryāti na cāmudraḥ praveśyate/vṛṣṇyandhakapure) 3. 16. 19; when the youthful Vṛṣṇi princes saw Śālva's army attacking Dvārakā, they came out and fought with the opponents (kumārā vṛṣṇinandanāḥ) 3. 17. 8; when Pradyumna swooned, the army of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas raised a cry of grief; when Pradyumna regained consciousness he blamed his charioteer for removing his chariot away from the battlefield for that was not the battle-dharma of Vṛṣṇ warriors (naiṣa vṛṣṇipravīrāṇām āhave dharma ucyate) 3. 19. 1-2, 5; he told the charioteer that one who left the battlefield was not born in the family of Vṛṣṇis (na sa vṛṣṇikule jāto yo vai tyajati saṁgaram), nor he who killed one fallen on the ground or who had surrendered, or a woman, an old man or a child, or one who was without a chariot, who was shattered, and whose weapons were broken; he reminded the charioteer that he (the charioteer) knew what the dharma of Vṛṣṇis was in battles, and since he knew the entire code of conduct of Vṛṣṇis engaged in fighting he should not have taken Pradyumna away form battlefield; (dharmajñaś cāsi vṛṣṇīnām āhaveṣv api…/sa jānaṁś caritaṁ kṛtsnaṁ vṛṣṇīṇāṁ pṛtanāmukhe/) 3. 19. 13-16; Pradyumna wondered what the women of Vṛṣṇi heroes would say to him when he met them 3. 19. 21; Pradyumna asked his charioteer how he could face Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis who always vied with him (mayā spardhanti satataṁ) 3. 19. 28; the charioteer in reply told Pradyumna that he was conversant with the war (conduct) of Vṛṣṇis (and he defended his action) (yuddhajñaś cāsmi vṛṣṇīnām) 3. 20. 2; Śālva tormented by Vṛṣṇis rode his Saubha to rise up in the sky and left Dvārakā 3. 20. 27; when Kṛṣṇa returned to Dvārakā he was surprised to see the town of Vṛṣṇis with men and women extremely uneasy (asvasthanaranārīkam idaṁ vṛṣṇipuraṁ bhṛśam) 3. 21. 4; Kṛṣṇa then spoke to Āhuka, Vasudeva and Vṛṣṇi heroes asking them to remain alert (apramādaḥ sadā kāryo); he announced his decision to attack Śālva which delighted Vṛṣṇis; comforted, they asked him to kill the enemies and blessed him 3. 21. 7-11; (18) Dhṛtarāṣṭra feared that Vṛṣṇi archers and spirited Pāñcālas, led by Kṛṣṇa, would burn the army of Kauravas 3. 48. 6; he told Saṁjaya that it was not possible even for mountains to withstand the velocity (of the attack) of Vṛṣṇis when led by Rāma and Kṛṣṇa (vṛṣṇīnām…/na śakyaḥ sahituṁ vegaḥ) 3. 48. 7; (19) When Vṛṣṇis went to Prabhāsa to meet the Pāṇḍavas during the period of their exile, they found them smeared with dirt resting on bare ground; seeing them, Vṛṣṇis were filled with sorrow and cried loudly; Yudhiṣṭhira approached Vṛṣṇis and honoured them as they deserved; they too in return honoured Pāṇḍavas and sat around them 3. 118. 15, 18-21; Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṁpāyana to tell him the details of the talks between Vṛṣṇis, sitting around, and Pāṇḍavas at Prabhāsa 3. 119. 1-3; Sātyaki suggested to Balarāma that he should permit the army of Daśārhas to march against Duryodhana so that he would perish when overtaken by the army of Vṛṣṇis; he also said that the army consisting of principal Kṣatriya warriors of Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas and Andhakas should kill the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and enhance its fame (kṣatriyaśūrasenā loke yaśaḥ sphītam upākarotu) 3. 120. 5, 19; (20) Kṛṣṇa told Draupadī that her sons while they were in the town of Vṛṣṇis (Dvārakā) they were not jealous of gods (tavātmajā vṛṣṇipuraṁ praviśya na daivatebhyaḥ spṛhayanti kṛṣṇe) 3. 180. 25; Satyabhāmā assured Draupadī that Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis had the same affection for her sons as for Pradyumna 3. 224. 14; (21) Draupadī warned Jayadratha that if he insisted on abducting her, Vṛṣṇi heroes led by Kṛṣṇa, would chase him (vṛṣṇivīrā…padavīṁ careyuḥ) 3. 252. 16 (Nī. on 3. 268. 14 (in another context) padavīṁ caretāṁ anveṣaṇaṁ kurutaḥ); (22) Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas and Andhakas went to Upaplavya to attend the marriage of Abhimanyu 4. 67. 14, 24; Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas and Bhojas returned to Dvārakā after the marriage 5. 7. 1; (23) Saṁjaya advised Yudhiṣṭhira that it was more beneficial for him to live by begging in the kingdom of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas than get back the kingdom by resorting to war (bhaikṣyacaryāṁ andhakavṛṣṇirājye śreyo manye na tu yuddhena rājyam) 5. 27. 2; (24) Andhakas, Vārṣṇeyas and Bhojas followed the advice of Kṛṣṇa and therefore they could restrain the enemies and delight their friends (andhakāś ca vārṣṇeyabhojāḥ); Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas, led by Kṛṣṇa, were like Indra (kṛṣṇapraṇītāḥ sarva evendrakalpāḥ) 5. 28. 11-12; (25) The son of Ugrasena (Kaṁsa) once shone amongst Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (vṛṣṇyandhakānāṁ madhyagataṁ tapantam) 5. 47. 72; (26) Once Nārada advised Vṛṣṇis that they should do their duty (tasmāt karmaiva kartavyam iti hovāca nāradaḥ/…vṛṣṇicakrasya) 5. 48. 22 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 5. 49. 22: karma yuddhaṁ kartavyaṁ tayor (i. e. kṛṣṇārjunayoḥ) iti śeṣaḥ/ācaṣṭa ākhyātavān nārada eva); (27) Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas could not be subjugated by Jarāsandha either due to the policy adopted by them or due to sheer luck (nayenāndhakavṛṣṇayaḥ/te na tasya vaśaṁ jagmuḥ kevalaṁ daivam eva vā) 5. 50. 39; (28) Kṛṣṇa protected Vṛṣṇis in all calamities (sarvāsv āpatsu) 5. 70. 4; (29) According to Duryodhana if Kṛṣṇa was arrested Vṛṣṇis would be under his control (tasmin baddhe bhaviṣyanti vṛṣṇayaḥ…vidheyā me) 5. 86. 14; (30) When Kṛṣṇa mounted the chariot to go to the Sabhā of Kauravas he was protected by Vṛṣṇis whose great chariot-fighters followed him (pṛṣṭhato 'nuyayuḥ); when he entered the Sabhā they walked behind him (āsan kṛṣṇasya pṛṣṭhataḥ) 5. 92. 14, 17, 33; (31) All Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis lived happily together when the Yādavas abandoned Kaṁsa in the interest of the family (saṁbhūya sukhaṁ edhante) 5. 126. 39; (32) Kṛṣṇa told Duryodhana that he was not alone in the Sabhā; Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis were with him; and when he laughed to show the great miracle (mahad āścaryaṁ 5. 129. 14) Vṛṣṇis and others, ready with weapons (samudyatamahāyudhāḥ), were there in front of him 5. 129. 3, 8-9; (33) Kṛṣṇa asked Karṇa to recognize Vṛṣṇis who were his kin from the mother's side (viz. Kuntī) (mātṛpakṣe ca vṛṣṇayaḥ/dvau pakṣāv abhijānīhi); in that case Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis would follow him 5. 138. 10, 13, 23; (34) Yudhiṣṭhira settled down in his camp at Kurukṣetra along with Vṛṣṇis (vṛṣnibhiś caiva …vṛtam) 5. 150. 2; (35) Balarāma came to Pāṇḍavas along with Vṛṣṇi chiefs (vṛṣṇimukhyair abhigataiḥ) 5. 154. 17; but he decided not to take part in the war from any side and left for pilgrimage along with Vṛṣṇis 9. 34. 1, 5, 12; (cf. 5. 154. 34); (36) Before the start of the war in the camp of Kauravas, Bṛhadbala along with the great warriors of Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis and Bhojas stood guard on the right side of the army (balaṁ tvadīyaṁ dakṣiṇato 'bhipāti) 6. 20. 14; (37) On the ninth day of the war, at night, Pāṇḍavas sat down to take counsel with Vṛṣṇis (vṛṣṇibhiḥ saha/…mantrāya samupāviśan) 6. 103. 10; (38) In the estimate of Vṛṣṇis, Cekitāna was a match for a hundred warriors in battle (śatād viśiṣṭaṁ yaṁ yuddhe samapaśyanta vṛṣṇayaḥ) 7. 9. 50; (39) Droṇa, in order to encourage Jayadratha said that, after all, Vṛṣṇis and the rest were not eternal and that some day they (and by turn they all) were going to die (vṛṣṇayo 'nye ca mānavāḥ/…adhruvā …/…paryāyeṇa vayaṁ sarve…paralokaṁ gamiṣyāmaḥ) 7. 52. 30-31; (40) Subhadrā wondered who could have killed Abhimanyu when Vṛṣṇi heroes were there to protect him; she pitied the heroism of Vṛṣṇi warriors (nātheṣu…vṛṣṇivīreṣu; dhig vīryaṁ vṛṣṇivīrāṇām) 7. 55. 9, 12; (41) On the fourteenth day, Saṁjaya told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāṇḍavas, Vṛṣṇis and others would blame him for the confusion in his mind (te buddhivyabhīcāram upalapsyanti) 7. 62. 7; the same day, Yudhiṣṭhira remembered that Arjuna, to praise Sātyaki, had told him in Dvaitavana that he would need Sātyaki's help even though Vṛṣṇis, led by Kṛṣṇa, were ready to help him 7. 85. 54, 58-60; Bhūriśravas wondered how Arjuna could look upon Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas who, by very nature were despicable, as authority (while deciding what was proper or improper in war) (prakṛtyaiva vigarhitāḥ/vṛṣṇyandhakāḥ kathaṁ pārtha pramāṇaṁ bhavatā kṛtāḥ//) 7. 118. 15; (42) During the night war (14th-15th day), Karṇa assured Duryodhana that he would defeat Vṛṣṇis and the rest 7. 133. 11; after the death of Droṇa, Sātyaki told Dhṛṣṭadyumna that he deserved to be expelled (from the war) by Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis since he did a vile act and yet praised himself (yāpyas tvam asi…sarvaiś cāpyandhakavṛṣṇibhiḥ) 7. 169. 11; (43) Sahadeva told Sātyaki that just as Pāṇḍavas had no friends other than Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis, they too had no friends other than Pāṇḍavas 7. 169. 48-49; Pāñcālas too had no friends better than Pāṇḍavas and Vṛṣṇis 7. 169. 50; (44) On the fifteenth day, when the Pāṇḍava army was being burnt by the Nārāyaṇāstra, Yudhiṣṭhira advised Sātyaki to leave the battle-field along with Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas 7. 170. 26; (45) On the seventeenth day, at night (niśi 8. 1. 25), Dhṛtarāṣṭra while lamenting the death of Karṇa, told Saṁjaya that Karṇa, depending on the strength of his arms, never thought highly of Vṛṣṇis (nāmanyata vai nityam…na vṛṣṇīn api… svabāhubalam āśritaḥ//) 8. 5. 15; (46) After the fall of Duryodhana, when Balarāma, in anger, left for Dvārakā, Pāñcālas and Vārṣṇeyas were disheartened (pāñcālāś ca savārṣṇeyāḥ…nātipramanaso 'bhavan) 9. 59. 27; (47) Kṛṣṇa narrated to Yudhiṣṭhira that Aśvatthāman had once come to Dvārakā where he was highly honoured by Vṛṣṇis (vṛṣṇibhiḥ paramārcitaḥ) 10. 12. 11; Kṛṣṇa told Aśvatthāman that he was never before requested to part with his cakra by any one of the great warriors among Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (as Aśvatthāman did) 10. 12. 33; (48) Kṛṣṇa told Gāndhārī that there was no one else except himself who could extirpate the clan of Vṛṣṇis (saṁhartā vṛṣṇicakrasya) 11. 25. 44; (49) While repenting the loss of life in war, Yudhiṣṭhira said to Arjuna that if Pāṇḍavas, instead of waging war, had chosen to beg in the town of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas they would not have killed the males in the army of their kinsmen and would not have met with the misfortune (yad bhaikṣam ācariṣyāma vṛṣṇyandhakapure vayam/ jñātīn niṣpuruṣān kṛtvā nemāṁ prāpsyāma durgatin) 12. 7. 3; (50) Yudhiṣṭhira while addressing Vyāsa pitied the plight of war widows who would curse Pāṇḍavas along with Vṛṣṇis 12. 33. 8; (51) Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna that a very long time had elapsed since he was with Baladeva and other Vṛṣṇi chiefs in Dvārakā (vṛṣṇipuṁgavān) and he would therefore like to return to Dvārakā 14. 15. 20; Arjuna assured him that he would soon meet them; Yudhiṣṭhira requested Kṛṣṇa to return to Hāstinapura for the Aśvamedha after meeting Vṛṣṇis 14. 51. 23, 46; (52) When Kṛṣṇa returned to Dvārakā, Vṛṣṇi heroes were celebrating the festival of the Raivataka mountain (vihāro vṛṣṇivīrāṇām mahe raivatakasya ha) 14. 58. 13; Bhojas, Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis received Kṛṣṇa on the Raivataka; Kṛṣṇa honoured them and enquired about the welfare of Vṛṣṇis who sat around him (sa tān abhyarcya medhāvī pṛṣṭvā ca kuśalaṁ tadā) 14. 58. 17-19; (53) On hearing the war account from Kṛṣṇa, Vṛṣṇis experienced the feelings of grief, pain, as well as delight (duḥkhaharṣaparikleśā vṛṣṇīnām abhavaṁs tadā) 14. 59. 36; (54) Kṛṣṇa, along with Vṛṣṇis, went to Hāstinapura for the horse sacrifice; when Vṛṣṇi heroes lived there, Parikṣit was born, Abhimanyu had told Uttarā that her son would learn from Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas the science of archery, the different astras, and the entire science of morals (gatvā vṛṣṇyandhakakulaṁ dhanurvedaṁ grahīṣyati/astrāṇi ca vicitrāṇi nītiśāstraṁ ca kevalam//) 14. 65. 1, 8, 24; (55) When Parikṣit was restored to life by Kṛṣṇa, Vṛṣṇi chiefs (vṛṣṇiśārdūlāḥ) gave Uttarā many jewels as gift; when Pāṇḍavas arrived at the place where Parikṣit was born, Vṛṣṇi chiefs (vṛṣṇipuṁgavāḥ) came out to welcome them (14. 69. 8-9, 13); Pāṇḍavas, along with Vṛṣṇis (vṛṣṇibhiḥ saha), entered Hāstinapura; when Vyāsa arrived, Kuru chiefs (Pāṇḍavas) sat near him along with Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka heroes (saha vṛṣṇyandhakavyāghraiḥ) 14. 70. 2, 11; (56) The Aśvamedha horse went to Dvāravatī which was protected by Vṛṣṇi heroes (vṛṣṇivīra-) 14. 84. 13; when the horse sacrifice was in progress, Kṛṣṇa, with Vṛṣṇis reached Hāstinapura 14. 88. 4; (57) Yudhiṣṭhira told Kuntī that only the Vṛṣṇi circle (vṛṣṇicakram) had survived the war due to the favour of Kṛṣṇa 15. 44. 34; (58) Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṁpāyana how were Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis and Bhojas destroyed in the presence of Vāsudeva and who pronounced the curse on them due to which they perished 16. 2. 1, 3; Vaiśaṁpāyana then told him that thirtysix years (after the coronation of Yudhiṣṭhira) Vṛṣṇis misbehaved and, as dictated by Kāla, they killed each other with pestle; the sages (Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva and Nārada) pronounced a curse to the effect that Sāmba would give birth to an iron pestle for the destruction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (vṛṣṇyandhakavināśāya); that pesttle would wipe out the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas who were illbehaved, cruel and naughty, and the entire race except Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa (yena yūyaṁ sudurvṛttā nṛśaṁsā jātamanyavaḥ/ucchettāraḥ kulaṁ kṛtsnam ṛte rāmajanārdanau); when Kṛṣṇa heard what had happened, he told Vṛṣṇis that the curse would prove true (bhavitavyaṁ tathā) 16. 2. 2, 8-9, 13; the next day Sāmba gave birth to a pestle for the destruction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; when the matter was reported to Ugrasena he prohibited fermentation of liquor in all the houses of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (adyaprabhṛti sarveṣu vṛṣṇyandhakagṛheṣv iha/surāsavo na kartavyaḥ sarvair nagaravāsibhiḥ//) 16. 2. 15, 18; (59) When Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas were trying to protect themselves, Kāla constantly visited their houses; a certain bald, fierce man surveyed their houses and disappeared; day after day strong winds blew to foretell the destruction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; day and night, sārikās produced shrill, unceasing sounds in the houses of Vṛṣṇis; pale pigeons with red feet, inspired by Kāla, moved in the houses of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; there occurred many other bad omens; asses with shrill voices responded to the sound produced by Pāñcajanya (evaṁ prayatamānānāṁ vṛṣṇīnām andhakaiḥ saha/kālo gṛhāṇi sarveṣāṁ paricakrāma nityaśaḥ; pāṇḍurā raktapādāś ca vihagāḥ kālacoditāḥ/vṛṣṇyandhakānāṁ geheṣu kapotā vyacaraṁs tadā; nadantaṁ pāñcajanyaṁ ca vṛṣṇyandhakaniveśane/samantāt pratyavāśyanta rāsabhā dāruṇasvarāḥ//) 16. 3. 1-7, 10-15; Vṛṣṇis, except Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, were not ashamed to commit sins; the rest hated Brāhmaṇas, fore-fathers and gods, disrespected elders in general; women and men transgressed rules of morality (patnyaḥ patīn vyuccaranta patnīś ca patayas tathā) 16. 3. 8-9; (60) Vṛṣṇi women dreamt at night that a black woman with white teeth, laughing, ran around Dvārakā robbing them and men dreamt that fierce demons deprived them of their ornaments, chatras flag-staffs and armours; the cakra given to Kṛṣṇa by Agni rose up to the sky within the sight of Vṛṣṇis (vṛṣṇīnāṁ paśyatām); the four horses took the chariot upwards and the Apsarases took away, day and night, the flag-staffs of Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa and asked Vṛṣṇis to proceed on a tīrthayātrā 16. 4. 1-5; (61) The great Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka heroes desired to go for a tīrthayātrā along with their women; they took with them eatables (meat) and drinks (liquors) of different kinds and set out of the city 16. 4. 6-8; (62) Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka heroes, overpowered by Kāla, saw Uddhava deserting them; Kṛṣṇa knew the iminent destruction of Vṛṣṇis and hence he did not object to Uddhava's leaving Vṛṣṇis (kālaparītās te vṛṣṇyandhakamahārathāḥ) 16. 4. 11-12; (63) Goaded by Kāla, Andhakas, Bhojas, Śaineyas and Vṛṣṇis struck one another with the darbhas turned into pestles 16. 4. 36 (cf. 16. 4. 34-35); (64) Brooding over the destruction of Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis, Kṛṣṇa thought it was time for him to depart (sa cintayāno 'ndhakavṛṣṇināśam…mene tataḥ saṁkramaṇasya kālam) 16. 5. 18; (65) Dāruka went to Kurus (i. e. Pāṇḍavas) and reported to them the mutual killings of Vṛṣṇis with pestles (ācaṣṭa mausale vṛṣṇīn anyonyenopasaṁhṛtān) 16. 6. 1; (66) Yudhiṣṭhira heard the destruction of the Vṛṣṇi clan (śuśrāva vṛṣṇicakrasya mausale kadanaṁ kṛtam) 16. 1. 7; Pāṇḍavas grieved to hear the destruction of Vṛṣṇis (Vārṣṇeyas) due to their attacking one another (parasparaṁ samāsādya… vṛṣṇīn vinaṣṭāṁś…) 16. 1. 9; (vinaṣṭān vārṣṇeyān sabhojakukurāndhakān) 16. 6. 2; (67) Arjuna saw Dvārakā in the form of a river which was once full of water in the form of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas but now bereft of Vṛṣṇi chiefs (tāṁ sa vṛṣṇyandhakajalām…dvārakāsaritaṁ…vihīnāṁ vṛṣṇipuṁgavaiḥ) 16. 6. 8, 10-11; (68) Kṛṣṇa had asked Vasudeva to inform Arjuna on his arrival at Dvārakā about the calamity that overtook Vṛṣṇis (vṛṣṇīnāṁ vaiśasaṁ mahat) 16. 7. 14; (69) Vasudeva told Arjuna that Vṛṣṇis were destroyed due to the misconduct of Pradyumna and Sātyaki; the two started the destruction of Vṛṣṇis (tayor apanayāt pārtha vṛṣṇayo nidhanaṁ gatāḥ/ …pradyumno yuyudhānaś ca…/…tāv ubhau vṛṣṇināśasya mukham āstām) 16. 7. 5-7; (70) Arjuna told Vasudeva that he would take with him the women of Vṛṣṇīs as well as their old men and children (vṛṣṇidārāṁs tu bālavṛddhāṁs tathaiva ca); he informed Dāruka that he would like to meet the ministers of Vṛṣṇi heroes (amātyān vṛṣṇivīrāṇām); he assured the gathering assembled in the Sudharmā Hall that he himself would take with him the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka people to Indraprastha (ahaṁ neṣye vṛṣṇyandhakajanaṁ svayam) 16. 8. 5, 6, 10; (71) Before departure, young Vṛṣṇi princes, led by Vajra, and the women offered oblations of water to Vasudeva (tato vajrapradhānās te vṛṣṇivīrakumārakāḥ/sarva evodakaṁ cakruḥ striyaś caiva mahātmanaḥ//); then Arjuna went to the place where Vṛṣṇis were destroyed; he was grieved to see them dead and did whatever was necessary on that occasion (prāptakālaṁ cakāra ca) 16. 8. 27-29; (72) On the seventh day after the funeral rites of Vasudeva and others, Arjuna started for Indraprastha; Vṛṣṇi women, weeping and grieved, followed him in carriages drawn by horses, bulls, asses and camels (pāṇḍavaḥ/saptame divase prāyād…aśvayuktair rathaiś cāpi gokharoṣṭrayutair api/striyas tā vṛṣṇivīrāṇām…anujagmur…//); he was also followed by the servants of Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis, as well as, by horse-riders, charioteers, and those riding elephants along with their foot-guards armed with excellent weapons (kuñjaraiś ca gajārohā yayuḥ…sapādarakṣaiḥ saṁyuktāḥ sottarāyudhikā yayuḥ); citizens, young and old, including sons of Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis, all the four castes and their women followed him; sixteen thousand wives of Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa) left Dvārakā following Vajra (daśa ṣaṭ ca sahasrāṇivāsude vāvarodhanam); the number of Bhoja, Andhaka, and Vṛṣṇi women who had lost their husbands was extremely large (bahūni ca sahasrāṇi prayutāny arbudāni ca/bhojavṛṣṇyandhakastrīṇāṁ hatanāthāni niryayuḥ//); the large number of prosperous Vṛṣṇi people looked like an ocean (tat sāgarasamaprakhyaṁ vṛṣṇicakraṁ mahardhimat); when those dwellers of Dvārakā left, the city was plunged in waters of ocean; the citizens left in great hurry crying ‘oh! this was our Fate!’ (tūrṇāt tūrṇataram jagmur aho daivam iti bruvan//) 16. 8. 32-41; (73) While Arjuna was taking Vṛṣṇis and their women with him, in Pañcanada they were attacked by Ābhīras (Dasyus) in order to deprive them of their wealth (abhyadhāvanta vṛṣṇīnāṁ taṁ janaṁ loptrahāriṇaḥ…abhipetur dhanārthaṁ te) 16. 8. 42-48; Vṛṣṇi warriors, riding elephants, horses and chariots, were unable to check the robbers carrying away Vṛṣṇi women; Arjuna tried to protect the large number of women running in different directions (kalatrasya bahutvāt tu saṁpatatsu tatas tataḥ); the excellent women were dragged away in the presence of all warriors; but some went willingly (pramadottamāḥ/samantato 'vakṛṣyanta kāmāc cānyāḥ pravavrajuḥ) 16. 8. 42, 47, 55-57; (74) Then Arjuna, helped by Vṛṣṇi servants, struck Dasyus with arrows (śaraiḥ pārtho…/jaghāna dasyūn…vṛṣṇibhṛtyaiḥ saha prabhuḥ//); excellent women of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas were abducted by Mlecchas in spite of Arjuna (prekṣatas tv eva pārthasya vṛṣṇyandhakavarastriyaḥ/ jagmur ādāya te mlecchāḥ//); the few women of Vṛṣṇīs who escaped were taken by Arjuna to Kurukṣetra and he settled them there at various places (tataḥ sa śeṣam ādāya kalatrasya mahāmatiḥ/ hṛtabhūyiṣṭharatnasya kurukṣetram avātarat/evaṁ kalatram ānīya vṛṣṇīnāṁ hṛtaśeṣitam/nyaveśayata kauravyas tatra tatra dhanaṁjayaḥ//) 16. 8. 58, 61, 65-66; (75) Arjuna informed Vyāsa about the destruction of Vṛṣṇi heroes at Prabhāsa caused by the curse of Brāhmaṇas; five hundred thousand brave Bhoja, Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka warriors had killed one another with erakā grass; he also told him that thousands of Vṛṣṇi women were abducted by Ābhīras of Pañcanada in spite of him (hataṁ pañcaśataṁ teṣāṁ sahasraṁ (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 16. 8. 11: pañcaśataṁ sahasraṁ sahasraguṇitaṁ pañcalakṣānīty arthaḥ); vṛṣṇidārāś ca…sahasraśaḥ/ ābhīrair…hṛtāḥ pañcanadālayaiḥ hṛtāḥ) 16. 9. 8-11, 16; (76) Vyāsa consoled Arjuna by saying that the great warriors of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas were burnt by the curse of Brāhmaṇas and therefore Arjuna should not be grieved over their destruction; what had happened was bound to happen for that was dictated by fate for the magnanimous (Vṛṣṇis) (bhavitavyaṁ tathā tad dhi diṣṭam etan mahātmanām) 16. 9. 25-26; (77) Arjuna reported to Yudhiṣṭhira exactly what had happened to Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka people (ācaṣṭa tad yathāvṛttam) 16. 9. 38; (78) Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṁpāyana what the Pāṇḍavas did after hearing about the strife in the family of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (vṛṣṇyandhakakule…āhavam); Vaiśaṁpāyana told him that having heard about the great destruction of Vṛṣṇis (vṛṣṇīnāṁ kadanaṁ mahat), Yudhiṣṭhira decided to leave the kingdom (to retire to the forest); considering the destruction of Vṛṣṇis and knowing the decision of Yudhiṣṭhira, all his brothers were glad to follow him (harṣo 'bhavac ca sarveṣāṁ bhrātṝṇāṁ gamanaṁ prati/yudhiṣṭhiramataṁ jñātvā vṛṣṇikṣayam avekṣya ca) 17. 1. 1-2, 22; (79) In heaven, Yudhiṣṭhira was shown great heroes of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (vṛṣṇyandhakamahārathān) among the groups of Sādhyas, Vasus and Maruts 18. 4. 14.

*1st word in right half of page p482  (+offset) in original book.Sūcī (Sūcī¤º)  : f.: Name of a particular arrangement of the army (vyūha). 

  A.   When to be used: According to the great sage Bṛhaspati if the number of warriors in one's army was small it should be gathered together, but if it was large it might be spread out as much as desired; in the former case the contingent in the front should be arranged according to the Sūcī vyūha (maharṣer vacanāt tāta vedayanti bṛhaspateḥ/saṁhatān yodhayed alpān kāmaṁ vistārayed bahūn//sūcīmukham anīkaṁ syād alpānāṁ bahubhiḥ saha/) 6. 19. 4-5; 12. 101. 44. 

  B.   Its use in the epic war: (1) In the opinion of Yudhiṣṭhira, since the Pāṇḍava army was smaller in number than that of their opponent, it was to be arranged as directed by the great sage (Bṛhaspati); this was his suggestion to Arjuna at the beginning of the war on the first day (asmākaṁ ca tathā sainyam alpīyaḥ sutarāṁ paraiḥ//etad vacanam ājñāya maharṣer vyūha pāṇḍava) 6. 19. 5-6; (Arjuna, however, chose to arrange the Pāṇḍava army according to the Vajravyūha 6. 19. 7); (2) When the contingent comprising the Kekaya princess the sons of Draupadī, and Dhṛṣṭaketu and which was led by Abhimanyu with a large force was asked by Yudhiṣṭhira to rush to the aid of Bhīmasena and Dhṛṣṭadyumna, they arranged themselves in such a way that its front formed the Sūcī 6. 73. 51, 54-55; (3) In order to protect Jayadratha a small contingent was arranged in the form of Sūcī which was concealed in the middle of the Padma vyūha, which itself formed the rear half of the main Śakaṭa (7. 53. 27) or the Cakraśakaṭa vyūha 7. 63. 21; 7. 63. 23; the front of the Sūcī (sūcīmukha) was formed by Kṛtavarman, followed by Jalasandha, the Kāmboja; Duryodhana with his Amātyas stood behind them; behind them, at the position of the ‘eye’ of the Sūci (? sūcipāśa 7. 63. 27), stood Jayadratha surrounded by a large force 7. 63. 24-27; 7. 53. 27; a hundred thousand warriors who would not turn away from the battle-field were distributed in the Śakaṭa vyūha to guard the Sūci vyūha (yodhānām anivartinām/vyavasthitāni sarvāṇi śakaṭe sūcirakṣiṇaḥ) 7. 63. 26.

*3rd word in left half of page p483  (+offset) in original book.Sūrya  : m.: Name of the planet Sun, referred to also as  Āditya  and by its other synonyms like  Arka, Ravi, Bhāskara, Bhānu, Pataṁga.  

  A.   Origin and activity: According to Bhīṣma, Āditya, along with Candra, other planets, constellations and stars were born from Viṣvaksena (i. e. Kṛṣṇa) (candrādityau grahanakṣatratārāḥ…viṣvaksenāt sarvam etat prasūtam) 13. 143. 31; Purusottama (Nārāyaṇa) told the seven sages, Marīci and others, that Sūrya, Candramas, all constellations act in their own prescribed way in their respective spheres and are considered an authority (suryācandramasau …sarve ca nakṣatragaṇāḥ…adhikāreṣu vartante yathāsvam…sarve pramāṇaṁ hi 12. 322. 39-40. 

  B.   Description: Radiant (gabhastimant) 2. 11. 17; (aṁśumant) 6. 32. 21; rich in light (vibhārasu) 6. 13. 44; very generous (paramodāra) 6. 13. 44. 

  C.   Extent: Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya to tell him everything about the extent (sarvaṁ pramāṇam) of Arka, to which Saṁjaya agreed 6. 12. 3-4; according to Saṁjaya's information the diameter (viṣkambha) of Sūrya was 1000 yojanas and the circumference (maṇḍala) was 30000 yojanas; (according to the learned Pauraṇīkas) Sūrya's expanse (? vipulatva) was 5800 yojanas (sūryas tv aṣṭau sahasrāṇi dve cānye kurunadana/ viṣkambheṇa, tato rājan maṇḍalaṁ triṁśataṁ samam//aṣṭapañcāśataṁ rājan vipulatvena cānagha/śrūyate paramodāraḥ pataṁgo 'sau vibhāvasuḥ/etat pramāṇam arkasya nirḍiṣṭam iha bhārata) 6. 13. 4344 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 12. 41 interprets vipulatvena as tato 'py ādhikeyena; in that case the circumference of Sūrya will be 30000 + 5800 = 35800 yojanas; see also the Editor's note on the stanza 6. 13. 41, Vol. 7, p. 765); on account of the larger extent of Rāhu, it covers Candra and Āditya at proper times (sa rāhuś chādayaty etau yathākālaṁ mahattayā/candrādityau) 6. 13. 45. 

  D.   Importance: (1) Upamanyu while praising Śiva said that he (Śiva) was Sūrya among the planets (grahāṇāṁ sūrya ucyase) 13. 14. 156; Sūrya appears in a complex name of Śiva (candrasūryagatiḥ) 13. 17. 37; (2) Śiva made Bhāskara the chief of the luminous bodies (tejasāṁ bhāskaraṁ cakre (īśam)) 12. 122. 31; Brahmā told the sages that Sūrya was the chief of the planets (sūryo grahāṇām adhipaḥ) 14. 43. 6; Arka was known as the chief of the hot luminaries (arko 'dhipatir uṣṇānām) 14. 43. 7; also cf. ādityo jyotiṣām patiḥ 6. 7. 14; khecarāṇāṁ pravaro yathārkaḥ 1. 83. 7; (3) Bhagavān, while narrating his vibhūtis, said that he was Ravi among the luminous bodies (jyotiṣāṁ ravir aṁśumān) 6. 32. 21; (4) The divine sages, the Siddhas, and the great sages saw Candra, Āditya and Budha, among others, in the abode of Brahman 1. 203. 4; Āditya, along with Candra and constellations, wait on Brahmadeva in his sabhā 2. 11. 17; 

  E.   Advent of the Kṛtayuga: Mārkaṇḍeya told the Pāṇḍavas that when Candra, Sūrya, the constellation Tiṣya (Puṣya) and Bṛhaspati will come together in one rāśi, the Kṛtayuga will set in 3. 188. 87 (for citation and Nī.'s commentary on it, see above  Puṣya^1,  p. 257. 1). 

  F.   Mythological events: (1) Candra, Āditya, the planets, the stars, the constellations and the denizens of the heaven felt dejected due to the destruction caused by Sunda and Upasunda (candrādityau grahās tārā nakṣatrāṇi divaukasaḥ/jagmur viṣādam) 1. 202. 26; (2) when the gods made ready a chariot for Śiva's fight with the Tripuras, Sūrya and Candramas were made the two wheels of the excellent chariot (sūryācandramasau kṛtvā cakre rathavarottame) 8. 24. 71. 

  G.   Auspicious: (1) Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that in war the side which had wind, Sūrya and Śukra favourable to it became victorious; if they were simultaneously present, the former of the two proved stronger (yato vāyur yataḥ sūryō yataḥ śukras tato jayaḥ/ pūrvaṁ pūrvaṁ jyāya eṣāṁ saṁnipāte yudhiṣṭhira//) 12. 101. 17; (2) Dhṛtarāṣṭra told Saṁjaya that when he heard that both Śukra and Sūrya were favourable to Pāṇḍavas indicating their victory, he lost all hopes of winning the war (yadā śrauṣam śukrasūryau ca yuktau kaunteyānām anukūlau jayāya/…tadā nāśaṁse vijayāya saṁjaya//) 1. 1. 129. 

  H.   Omens: (1) According to an astronomical event which took place before the war and which was noticed by Vyāsa, amāvāsyā occurred on the thirteenth day of the month which was very unusual; on that occasion Candra and Sūrya were untimely swallowed the same month by Rāhu which indicated destruction of the subjects (caturdaśīṁ pañcadaśīm bhūtapūrvāṁ ca ṣoḍaśīm/imāṁ tu nābhijānāmi amāvāsyāṁ trayodaśīm//candrasūryāv ubhau grastāv ekamāse trayodaśīm/ aparvaṇi grahāv etau prajāḥ saṁkṣapayiṣyataḥ//) 6. 3. 28-29 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 3. 28: parva darśākhyaṁ pañcadaśe 'hni bhavati/ekatithivṛddhau ṣoḍaṡe vā ekatithikṣaye caturdaśe vāhni bhavati/ tithidvayakṣayas tu loke 'tyantam aprasiddha ity aparvaṇity uktam/grahaṁ yātau rāhuṇā grahaṇaṁ prāptau etad eva prajāsaṁkṣayahetutvena śāstre dṛṣṭam/); a similar event--Rāhu swallowing both Āditya and Soma simultaneously--also occurred when the Sindhu heroes fought Arjuna and at that time the meteors struck Sūrya and were scattered (ulkāś ca jaghnire sūryaṁ vikīryantyaḥ samantataḥ) 14. 76. 15-16; for Rāhu's swallowing Āditya out of time (aparvaṇi) also cf. 2. 71. 26, and 9. 55. 10; also cf. 5. 141. 10; and 6. 3. 11 (in the last two references aparvaṇi does not occur); (for Nī.'s comment on Bom. Ed. 5. 143. 11 see  Rāhu  above p. 267. 1 and on Bom. Ed. 6. 3. 11 he says: tatra tulāstham arkaṁ rāhur upaiti); (2) According to another omen noticed by Vyāsa, Arka, Indu and the constellations were blazing day and night irrespective of the fact whether it was day time or night time; that also indicated desstruction (jvalitārkendunakṣatram nirviśeṣadinakṣapam/ahorātraṁ mayā dṛṣtaṁ tat kṣayāya bhaviṣyati) 6. 2. 22; (3) According to an omen noticed by Karṇa, a line of black clouds covered Bhānu at dawn and dusk which foretold great danger (kṛṣṇaś ca parighas tatra bhānum āvṛtya tiṣṭhati/ udayāstamye saṁdhye vedayāno mahad bhayam//) 5. 141. 22 (but Nī. on Bom. Ed 5. 143. 23: parighaḥ pariveśaḥ); (4) According to the omens noticed by Saṁjaya, when the two armies faced each other at Kurukṣetra, Āditya at its rise appeared as though split into two (dvidhābhūta ivāditya udaye pratyadṛśyata) 6. 17. 3; (5) When Karṇa marched out for war many unusual happenings (utpātas) occurred, one of them being that seven major planets were seen issuing out of Sūrya (niścaranto vyadṛśyanta sūryāt sapta mahāgrahāḥ) 8. 26. 34 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 8. 37. 4: niścaranto yuddhārtham iti śeṣaḥ/suāryāt sūryam ārabhya sūryādayo 'nyonyam yudhyantīty arthaḥ); (6) Yājñavalkya told Janaka that if one saw the moon (Soma) or the sun (Sahasrāṁśu) with a hole (in the middle) like a wheel with a broken nave he had only a week to live (śīrṇanābhi yathā cākraṁ chidraṁ somaṁ prapaśyati/tathaiva ca sahasrāṁśuṁ saptarātreṇa mṛtyubhāk) 12. 305. 13. 

  I.   Similes: (1) Draupadī's five sons rushed at the demon Ārśyaśṛṅgi (Alambusa) as five planets rush at Ravi (grahāḥ pañca yathā ravim) 6. 96. 35; (2) Bhīmasena, encircled by the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, looked like Sūrya encircled by fierce planets at the time of the destruction of the people (prajāsaṁharaṇe sūryaḥ krūrair iva mahāgrahaiḥ) 6. 73. 10; (3) Lakṣmaṇa and Rāma, surrounded by the monkey-chiefs, looked like Candra and Sūrya surrounded by the planets (candrasūryau grahair vṛtau) 3. 267. 17. [For  Sūrya  also see Section 1. 7 where other references to the sun's eclipse can be found]

  A.   Description: Versed in the Vedas (vedādhyayanasaṁpanna) 6. 1. 4; heroic (śūra) 7. 102. 67; 7. 135. 20; 7. 143. 28; (vīra) 6. 1. 2; 6. 104. 25; of great strength (mahābala) 6. 1. 3; great chariot-fighters (mahāratha) 6. 103. 4; 6. 112. 75; great archers (maheṣvāsa) 6. 93 38; welcoming wars (yuddhābhinandin) 6. 1. 4; wishing to get victory or die in war (āśaṁsanto jayaṁ yuddhe vadhaṁ vābhimukhā raṇe) 6. 1. 4. 

  B.   Epic events: (1) Recounting the war events to Saṁjaya, Dhṛtarāṣṭra said that before Bhīṣma's fall he had reduced Somakas to a small number (kṛtvā somakān alpaśeṣān) 1. 1. 127; (2) At the start of the svayaṁvara of Draupadi, the priest of Somakas (in such contexts they are identified with Pāñcālas) gave offerings in fire, asked Brāhmaṇas to pronounce benediction (brāhmaṇān svasti vācya ca) and then stopped the sound of musical instruments 1. 176. 31-32; (3) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya how strong Somakas were with Dhṛṣṭadyumna as their general (dhṛṣṭadyumnena senānyā somakāḥ kimbalā iva) 5. 49. 9; (4) Duryodhana and others thought that if Kṛṣṇa was arrested Pāṇḍavas and Somakas would give up all their effort (nirudyamā bhaviṣyanti) 5. 128. 7; (5) When Pāṇḍavas had settled down at Hiraṇvatī, Duryodhana sent Ulūka as his messenger to them and Somakas 5. 157. 3; (6) Bhīṣma had assured Duryodhana that he would kill Pāṇḍavas and Somakas 5. 170. 2; (7) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya how did Kurus and Pāṇḍava-Somakas fight with one another at Kurukṣetra; thereupon Saṁjaya described to him how they fought when Somakas, determined to win or die while engaged in fighting, attacked Kauravas (āśaṁsanto jayaṁ yuddhe vadhaṁ vābhimukhā raṇe) 6. 1. 1-4; Kauravas and Pāṇḍava-Somakas sat together before the start of the war and mutually agreed upon certain conventions and rules to be followed in the war (tatas te samayaṁ cakruḥ kurupāṇḍavasomakāḥ/ dharmāṁś ca sthāpayām āsur yuddhānām …//) 6. 1. 26, 33; the conventions and rules detailed in 6. 1. 27-32; (8) Duryodhana told Duḥśāsana that if Bhīṣma was protected in war he would kill Pāṇḍavas, Somakas and Sṛñjayas 6. 16. 14; (9) When Arjuna got prepared for the war Somakas and others blew their conches 6. 41. 2; (10) On the second day of the war, Dhṛṣṭadyumna and Somakas showered arrows on Droṇa 6. 48. 30; (11) On the third day, Kṛṣṇa noticed Bhīṣma routing Somakas chased by the delighted Kauravas (prabhagnān dṛśya somakān) 6. 55. 68; (12) On the fifth day, when Bhīṣma started killing Pāñcālas and Somakas, they acted nobly and decided to attack Bhīṣma (āryāṁ yuddhe matiṁ kṛtvā bhīṣmam evābhidudruvuḥ) 6. 68. 31; (13) On the sixth day, Śikhaṇḍin surrounded by Somakas and Irāvant stood at the ‘tail’ of the Makaravyūha of Pāṇḍavas (pucche makarasya) 6. 71. 4, 11; Somakas were terrified (vitresuḥ) to hear the sound of Droṇa's conch when he blew it after defeating Drupada 6. 73. 46; (14) On the eighth day, when the Pāṇḍava army attacked Bhīṣma he killed Pāñcālas, Somakas and Sṛñjayas with his arrows; nevertheless, abandoning the fear of death they attacked Bhīṣma (tyaktvā mṛtyukṛtaṁ bhayam) 6. 84. 2-4; battle that ensued, in which Bhīṣma cut off their hands and heads and felled down those riding chariots, horses and elephants (virathān rathinaś cakre; hayebhyo hayasādinām; nirmanuṣyāṁś ca mātaṅgāñ…), described in 6. 84. 5-7; when Droṇa attacked Somakas and Sṛñjayas in order to kill them (abhyadravata… preṣayiṣyam yamakṣayam) a loud cry was raised by Sṛñjayas (by implication also by Somakas) (tatrākrando mahān āsīt sṛñjayānām) 6. 85. 20-21; that night, Karṇa assured Duryodhana that he would kill all Pārthas and Somakas if Bhīṣma laid down his arms and left the battlefield 6. 93. 13; Duryodhana then went to Bhīṣma and reminded him that he had assured him (Duryodhana) to kill Somakas; he asked Bhīṣma to carry out his assurance by killing Somakas 6. 93. 37-38; thereupon Bhīṣma once again assured Duryodhana that next day he would either kill Somakas and Pāñcālas to delight him or they would kill him (tair vāhaṁ nihataḥ saṁkhye gamiṣye yamasādanam/tān vā nihatya saṁgrāme prītim dāsyāmi vai tava//) 6. 94. 14-15; (15) On the ninth day, in the morning, Duryodhana asked the kings to get ready with their armies since Bhīṣma was going to kill that day Somakas (adya bhīṣmo… nihaniṣyati somakān) 6. 95. 1; at mid-day, Bhīṣma fought a fierce battle with Somakas blowing them away by hundreds and thousands with his sharp arrows (vyadhaman …śataśo 'tha sahasraśaḥ) 6. 99. 1-2; in the evening when the sun had set (bhāskare 'stam upāgate 6. 103. 1), Yudhiṣṭhira seeing that great chariot-fighters among Somakas had been defeated and had lost enthusiasm (jitān dṛṣtvā…nirutsāhān mahārathān) felt like ordering cessation of hostilities for that day (avahāram arocayat) 6. 103. 4; (16) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya how, on the tenth day, did Bhīṣma face Pāṇḍavas while at the same time killing Somakas 6. 104. 25; Dhṛṣṭadyumna, aided by Somakas, attacked Droṇa 6. 111. 30; Bhīṣma, when attacked by Śikhaṇḍin, killed Somakas who followed Arjuna (pārthapadānugān) 6. 112. 64; none of the great chariot-fighters of Somakas hoped to live after facing Bhīṣma in battle (na…yaḥ saṁprāpya raṇe bhīṣmaṁ jīvite sma mano dadhe) 6. 112. 75; exhorted by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Somakas and Sṛñjayas rushed at Bhīṣma showering weapons on him from all sides (abhyadravanta…śastravṛṣṭyā samantataḥ) 6. 113. 16-17; Somakas and Pāñcālas were delighted when Bhīṣma fell down 6. 114. 107; (17) On the fourteenth day, when Droṇa started killing Somakas no one succeeded in facing him, nor was any one able to pierce him (with an arrow) (na cāpyabhiyayuḥ kecid apare naiva vivyadhuḥ) 7. 85. 34; watching the fierce duel between Satyasena and Sātyaki, Kauravas and Somakas praised them 7. 94. 7; in the afternoon of that day, Droṇa again fought with Somakas (aparāhṇe…saṁgrāmaḥ samapadyata/…punar droṇasya somakalḥ) 7. 101. 1; when the different alignments of the Pāṇḍava army were being agitated by Droṇa (vyūheṣv āloḍyamāneṣu), Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Somakas went deep into the army of Kauravas (sudūram anvayuḥ); the battle fought was so fierce that it looked like the end of the world (yugānta iva bhārata) 7. 102. 1-2; when Bhīma marched to offer assistance to Arjuna, Pāñcālas and Somakas followed him 7. 102. 67; after the death of Jayadratha, in the evening (astaṁ gacchati bhāskare), Droṇa fought a fierce battle with Somakas (somakaiḥ sārdham saṁgrāmo lomaharṣaṇaḥ); at that time great chariot-fighters of Somakas made every attempt to kill Droṇa (te tu sarve prayatnena bhāradvājaṁ jighāṁsavaḥ/…ayudhyanta mahārathāḥ//) 7. 121. 45-46; Droṇa sent a message to Aśvatthāman through Duryodhana not to spare Somakas in order to save his own life (na somakāḥ pramoktavyā jīvitaṁ parirakṣatā) 7. 126. 33; (18) In the night war (which took place between the fourteenth and the fifteenth day), Duryodhana assured his fleeing army that he would himself kill Pārthas together with Pāñcālas and Somakas 7. 134. 54: Duryodhana requested Aśvatthāman to kill Pāñcālas and Somakas who, agitated, were moving in his army like a confiagration; he should kill them before they killed Kauravas (ete hi somakā…mama sainyeṣu saṁrabdhā vicaranti davāgnivat) 7. 134. 76-78; Aśvatthāman assured Duryodhana that for his sake and to delight him he would fight with Pāñcālas, Somakas and Kekayas (eṣa gacchāmi saṁgrāme tvatkṛte…/…tvatpriyārtham); scorched by his arrows, Somakas and others would run away in all directions; seeing his valour, Yudhiṣṭhira and Somakas would consider the world full of Aśvatthāman (aśvatthāmamayaṁ lokaṁ maṁsyante); Yudhiṣṭhira would be dejected seeing the slain Pāñcālas and Somakas; Aśvatthāman would kill only those who engaged him in battle (ye māṁ yuddhe 'bhiyotsyanti tān haniṣyāmi…); once Somakas were within his reach they would not return alive 7. 135. 10-14; in the battle that followed Pāñcālas and Somakas fled 7. 135. 20; Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas, Matsyas and Somakas followed Arjuna and Bhīma to attack Droṇa from right and left respectively (bībhatsur dakṣiṇaṁ pārśvam uttaraṁ tu vṛkodaraḥ) 7. 136. 13-14; Duryodhana advised his brothers to offer protection to Droṇa so that he would be able to kill Pārthas, Somakas and Sṛñjayas along with their kings (somakān hanyāt sṛñjayāṁś ca sarājakān) 7. 139. 21, 24; in the midst of the fierce night war (raudre rātriyuddhe), Yudhiṣṭhira exhorted Pāṇḍavas and Somakas to attack Droṇa alone in order to kill him; accordingly, they attacked Droṇa uttering frightening cries (abhyadravata gacchadhvaṁ droṇam eva jighāṁsayā/… droṇam evābhyavartanta nadanto bhairavān ravān) 7. 140. 2-3; when Karṇa's son Vṛṣasena cut off the armours of Drupada's army, Somakas, frightened, fied (somakā vipradudruvuḥ); while they were running away they appeared bright due to the light of the torches (tatas tu drupadānīkaṁ śaraiś chinnatanucchadam/saṁprādravat …/dravamāṇāś ca somakāḥ vyarājanta… pradīpair avabhāsitāḥ); after defeating great Somaka charriot-fighters Vṛṣasena turned towards Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 143. 21, 2425, 28; when Śikhaṇḍin, defeated by Kṛpa turned back, Somakas and others covered him on all sides; then the battle started again 7. 144. 25, 27-28; seeing Droṇa killing the Pāṇḍava army (pāṇḍavīṁ camūm), Somakas quickly pierced him by showering arrows (vivyadhuḥ somakās tūrṇaṁ… śaravṛṣṭibhiḥ); but Droṇa deprived them of their lives 7. 147. 13-14; Kṛṣṇa drew Arjuna's attention to Bhīma who, covered by Somakas and the Pāṇḍava army, attacked Droṇa and Karṇa (vṛtaḥ somakapāṇḍavaiḥ) 7. 147. 28; when only the three parts of the (last quarter of the) night remained and the sun was about to rise, Droṇa divided his army into two parts and attacked Somakas and Pāṇḍavas along with Pāñcālas (tribhāgamātraśeṣāyām rātryāṁ; aruṇo 'bhyudayāṁ cakre) 7. 161. 1-3 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 7. 186. 1; tribhāgamātraśeṣāyāṁ muhūrtatrayāvaśiṣṭāyām); (19) On the fifteenth day, Droṇa released brāhma missile trying to kill all Somakas (vinighnan sarvasomakān) 7. 164. 80; just before the fall of Droṇa, Kurus and Somakas got mixed up with one another in a battle shouting and felling each other with weapons (tataḥ pravṛtte saṁgrāme vimiśrāḥ kurusomakāḥ/…śastrair dehān apātayan//) 7. 165. 99; when the fleeing Pāñcāla warriors did not return to fight they were made to stand still where they were by Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna (7. 171. 67-69; 7. 172. 1-2); only Arjuna, along with Somakas and the constituents of their armies (?) returned to fight with Aśvatthāman (eka eva tu bībhatsuḥ somakāvayavaiḥ saha) 7. 172. 3 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 7. 201. 3; somakāvayavaiḥ somakānām avayavarūpair māṇḍalikaiḥ); (20) On the sixteenth day, when Aṅgas attacked Nakula, Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Somakas attacked them to cover Nakula (nakulaṁ…pari petuḥ… pāṇḍupāñcālasomakāḥ); then chariotfighters fought with elephant-riders (rathināṁ hastibhiḥ saha) 8. 17. 21-22; when Somakas were being killed by the arrows of Karṇa, afflicted by pain and wounded by arrows, they hid themselves (avālīyanta rājendra vedanārtāḥ śarārditāḥ); (the Kaurava army too, being killed by Nakula, dispersed in all directions); the two armies then, standing beyond the range of arrows, chose to act as spectators (te sene… prekṣakavat sthite) 8. 17. 73-75; (21) Even after the battle of the sixteenth day, Dhṛtarāṣṭra was confident that Karṇa alone was capable of killing Pāṇḍavas and Somakas 8. 22. 16; (22) On the seventeenth day, Arjuna felt that by killing Karṇa he would give satisfaction to the great chariotfighters of Somakas for having fulfilled their task to help their allies in war (kṛtaṁ kāryaṁ ca manyantāṁ mitrakāryepsavo yudhi) 8. 52. 25; Karṇa in the afternoon (aparāhṇe) of that day killed all Somakas in the presence of Bhīma 8. 56. 7, 53; Arjuna expressed his fear to Kṛṣṇa that if Kṛpa, Kṛtavarman and Aśvatthāman were not killed they would cause the destruction of Somakas (avadhyamānās te 'smābhir ghātayiṣyanti somakān) 8. 57. 5; Karṇa fought a great battle with Somakas in which he crushed them while destroying their chariots and killing horses and elephants (sumahat…cakre yuddhaṁ somakān saṁpramṛdnan) 8. 60. 14; when Karṇa came up to Arjuna to kill him, Somakas urged (abhyakrośan) Arjuna to hasten to pierce Karṇa (with an arrow), cut off his head without delay and shatter the hope of Duryodhana to get kingdom (vidhya karṇam/chinddhy asya mūrdhānam alaṁ cireṇa śraddhāṁ ca rājyād dhṛtarāṣṭrasūnoḥ) 8. 65. 10; when Karṇa covered (samācinot) Arjuna with a hundred Kṣudraka arrows and pierced (bibheda) Kṛṣṇa with sixty arrows, Somakas fied; Arjuna stopped them (tadantaraṁ somakāḥ prādravanta/…pārthaḥ somakān pratyagṛhṇāt) 8. 65. 32-34; seeing Karṇa lying dead on the ground, Somakas, delighted, made loud noise, sounded musical instruments and shook their (upper) garments and hands; others danced and embraced each other saying: “Karṇa is pierced with an arrow as fire is extinguished by a strong wind at the end of a sacrifice or at daybreak in a bedroom; Karṇa's body with arrows all over it and smeared with blood shines like sun with his rays; the sun in the form of Karṇa has been forced to set by Kāla in the form of Arjuna; as the sun while setting takes away his light, so has the arrow taken away Karṇa's life” 8. 67. 28-32; after the death of Karṇa, in the evening, at the foot of the Himavant (haimavate prasthe 9. 5. 1) and near the river Sarasvatī (9. 4. 49), Śalya when requested by Duryodhana to lead the army (9. 5. 26-27), he (Śalya) assured him that he would defeat Pārthas and Somakas in battle 9. 6. 3; after Śalya's election as the general, the great chariot-fighters of Madrakas while praising Śalya said that he was capable of defeating in battle even gods, demons and men, let alone Somakas and Sṛñjayas (kimu somakasṛñjayān) 9. 6. 9; that night, in the camp of Pāṇḍavas, Kṛṣṇa encouraged Yudhiṣṭhira to fight with Śalya; after he left, Yudhiṣṭhira gave leave to Pāñcālas and Somakas to leave his camp (visṛjya pāñcālān atha somakān) 9. 6. 39; (23) On the eighteenth day when Bhīma attacked Kṛpa, the great chariot-fighters of Somakas too attacked him and others in order to kill their opponents (abhyadravanta…jighāṁsantaḥ parān yudhi) 9. 7. 31; Somakas fell down by thousands due to the arrows of Śalya; after a while, Śalya again struck down Somakas and Pāṇḍava army and caused distress to Yudhiṣṭhira (somakāś ca sahasraśaḥ/patitāḥ; śalyo 'pi…nighnan somakapāṇḍavān/… yudhiṣṭhiram apīḍayat) 9. 10. 21, 41; when Yudhiṣṭhira announced his decision to kill Śalya, the army of Pāṇḍavas, especially the Pāñcālas, Somakas and Matsyas, expressed delight which helped the fulfilment of Yudhiṣṭhira's vow (i. e. encouraged him) (tataḥ praharṣaḥ sainyānāṁ…pāñcālānāṁ somakānāṁ matsyānāṁ ca viśeṣataḥ/ pratijñāṁ tāṁ ca saṅgrāme dharmarājasya pūrayan) 9. 15. 26-27; seeing Śalya, killing his opponents, angered Somakas and others, surrounded him (parivavruḥ) 9. 16. 6; after the death of Śalya, when the Madra army attacked the Pāṇḍava army, Somakas and others covered Yudhiṣṭhira on all sides to protect him (yudhiṣṭhiraṁ parīpsantaḥ samantāt paryavārayan) 9. 17. 8; Somakas and others thought that the elephant of king Śālva (9. 19. 2-3), though one, was moving in thousand forms around them (tam eva nāgaṁ dadṛśuḥ samantāt/ sahasraśo vai vicarantam ekam) 9. 19. 6; Duryodhana alone halted (avārayat) with his sharp missiles the attack of Somakas and others 9. 20. 34; Aśvatthāman assured Duryodhana who had taken shelter in the Dvaipāyana lake that he would kill Somakas and others on that very day (adya nihaniṣyāmi somakān) 9. 29. 19; when Duryodhana's whereabouts became known, delighted Somakas shouted loudly (prākrośan somakās tatra) 9. 29. 48; Somakas and others held Duryodhana in high regard (sarva evābhyapūjayan) when he challenged Bhīma to prove his boasts 9. 55. 40; after the duel began, Somakas and Pāṇḍavas were afraid when they noticed the velocity of the wind produced by Duryodhana's mace (gadā mārutavegaṁ hi dṛṣṭvā) 9. 56. 31; when at one stage Bhīma lost consciousness due to the stroke of Duryodhana's mace on his chest, Somakas and Pāṇḍavas, their hopes dashed to the ground, became dejected (bhṛśopahatasaṁkalpā nahṛṣṭamanaso 'bhavan) 9. 56. 49; Somakas were thrilled to see Duryodhana fall down (dadṛśuḥ hṛṣṭaromāṇaḥ) 9. 58. 2; the chief warriors among Somakas, who were righteous, did not approve of Bhīma's putting his foot on the head of fallen Duryodhana (nābhyanandan dharmātmānaḥ somakānāṁ prabarhāḥ) 9. 58. 13; (24) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya whether Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman took part in destroying the camp of Pāṇḍavas and in killing them and Somakas while fighting, and then go the way Duryodhana did (i. e. die in battle) (kaccit pramathya śibiraṁ hatvā somakapāṇḍavān/duryodhanasya padavīṁ gatau paramikāṁ raṇe//) 10. 8. 3; while moving in the camp, Aśvatthāman happened to see the sons of Draupadī and the surviving Somakas (avaśiṣṭāṁś ca somakān) 10. 8. 44; as far as the destruction of Somakas, who were asleep and not on their guard, was concerned that night proved to be extremely cruel (evaṁvidhā hi sā rātriḥ somakānāṁ janakṣaye/prasuptānāṁ pramattānām āsīt subhṛśadāruṇā//) 10. 8. 142; Aśvatthāman was delighted that Somakas and the Matsyas who had survived were all killed by him; he felt that he and his associates had done their duty; he wanted to give that very delightful news to Duryodhana if he was still alive (somakā matsyaśeṣāś ca sarve vinihatā mayā//idānīṁ kṛtakṛtyāḥ sma…/yadi jīvati no rājā tasmai śaṁsāmahe priyam//) 10. 8. 150-151.

  A.   Founding and explanation of the name: The city was founded by king Hastin, the son of Suhotra and Suvarṇā; that is why the city is called Hāstinapura (tasyām (i. e. suvarṇāyām) asya (i. e. suhotrasya) jajñe hastī/ya idaṁ hāstinapuraṁ māpayām āsa/etad asya hāstinapuratvam) 1. 90. 36;

  D.

  A place in the Āraṭṭa (Bāhlīka) country; one who stays there (long) cannot go to heaven; hence one should not stay there for more than a day--this is what a Brāhmaṇa told in the assembly of the Kurus (yad anyo 'py uktavān sabhyo brāhmaṇaḥ kurusaṁ sadi//…proṣya cāpy acyutasthale/ …kathaṁ svargaṁ gamiṣyati//…āraṭṭā nāma bāhlīkā na teṣv āryo dvyahaṁ vaset //) 8. 30. 41-43; the place also mentioned in what a Piśācī said to a Brāhmaṇī (?) who came to stay at Raupyā with her sons; this was told by Lomaśa to Yudhiṣṭhira when he wanted to recite the anuvaṁśa stanzas about Raupyā; according to the Piśācī no one who had stayed at Acyutasthala was supposed to stay near Raupyā for more than one night (atrānuvaṁśaṁ paṭhataḥ śṛṇu me kurunandana/…piśācī yad abhāṣata/…uṣitvā cācyutasthale/… ekarātram uṣitveha dvitīyāṁ yadi vatsyasi/ etad vai te divā vṛttaṁ rātrau vṛttam ato 'nyathā//) 3. 129. 8-10; (according to the prāñcaḥ, whose view is cited by Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 129. 9, one could stay at Raupyā even after staying at Acyutasthala if he had performed the prescribed prāyaścitta viz. the prājāpatya vrata; according to these prāñcaḥ, Acyutasthala was the village where people born of mixed marriages lived (acyutasthalākhye saṁkarajānāṁ grāme); according to others, however, who understood the word in good light, Acyutasthala meant the subtle body (liṅgaśarīra) and uṣitvā meant by being near the sūtrātman (sūtrātmānam upāsya)).

_______________________________
*4th word in left half of page p634  (+offset) in original book.Uttarāyaṇa  : nt.: Name of the period in which the sun moves to the north, the summer solstice; also called  Udagā¤yana  (-ā- m. c.) (6. 114. 98; 12. 224. 16). 

  A.   Sun's courses fixed by Brahman: Śakra told Bali that the self-born god (Svayaṁbhū) had fixed the movements of the sun following which the sun moved towards the north for six months and towards the south for six months 12. 218. 35-36. 

  B.   Its duration: The calculators of the divisions of time say that the year consists of two ayanas (sun's courses), viz. dakṣiṇa and uttara (saṁvatasaraṁ dve ayane vadanti saṁkhyāvido dakṣiṇam uttaram ca) 12. 224. 13; (12. 47. 42); 13. 16. 46; Nārada told Devamata that the two ayanas (dakṣiṇa and uttara) form a pair and between them is fire; Brāhmaṇas knew that that is the highest form of udāna (? ubhe caivāyane dvaṁdvaṁ tayor madhye hutāśanaḥ/etad rūpam udānasya paramaṁ brāhmanā viduḥ) 14. 24. 15; Vyāsa had told Śuka that the night and the day of the gods was equal to one human year of which the uttarāyaṇa formed the day and the dakṣiṇāyana the night (daive rātryahanī varṣam pravibhāgas tayoḥ punaḥ/ahas tatrodagayanaṁ rātriḥ syād dakṣiṇāyanam) 12. 224. 16. 

  C.   Effects on the earth: The sun, during its two courses, northern and southern, distributes cold and heat among the people (ayanaṁ tasya ṣaṇmāsā uttaraṁ dakṣiṇaṁ tathā/ yena saṁyāti lokeṣu śītoṣṇe visṛjan raviḥ//) 12. 218. 36; the sun, having traversed its northern course and having collected with his rays the heated waters, turnes for the southern course and enters the earth; there, lying in the earth and sprinkled with the energies of the moon, it produces plants which serve as food for living beings (gatvottarāyaṇaṁ tejorasān uddhṛtya raśmibhiḥ/dakṣiṇāyanam āvṛtto mahīṁ niviśate raviḥ//… niṣiktaś candratejobhiḥ sūyate bhūgato raviḥ/oṣadhyaḥ ṣaḍrasā medhyās tad annaṁ prāṇināṁ bhuvi//) 3. 3. 6, 8 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 3. 6: tejorasān jalāni). 

  D.   Importance: Mahādeva (13. 16. 13) identified with both the Uttara and the Dakṣiṇa ayana 13. 16. 46. 

  E.   Considered holy: The night in the Uttarāyaṇa is considered holy and divine; Śacī bowed down to this goddess Rātri so that her wish to see her husband was fulfilled (puṇyāṁ cemām ahaṁ divyāṁ pravṛttām uttarāyaṇe/devīṁ rātrim namasyāmi sidhyatāṁ me manorathaḥ//) 5. 13. 23; from Dakṣiṇāyana (which symbolizes darkness) proceeds Uttarāyaṇa (which stands for light); (hence) the gift of light is praiseworthy (andhaṁ tamas tamisraṁ ca dakṣiṇāyanam eva ca/uttarāyaṇam etasmāj jyotirdānaṁ praśasyate//) 13. 101. 46 (perhaps what is meant is that giving gifts of light helps the bringing in of the Uttarāyaṇa. Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 98. 47: tamisraṁ andhakāraḥ/andhaṁtamo nāma narakarūpaṁ tathā dakṣiṇāyanam apy andhaṁtama eva/ata uttarāyaṇe rātrau tamonāśakaṁ jyotir deyaṁ narakanivṛttyartham. Editor, Cr. Ed., Vol. 17. (part II), p. 1098 on 13. 101. 46, however,: “Does this suggest the origin of the Dīpāvali festival ?”). 

  F.   Bhīṣma's death in Uttarāyaṇa: Bhīṣma when he fell on the ground in the war did not give up his life as he wished to wait till the setting in of the Uttarāyaṇa 6. 114. 89; he assured the sages, sent to him by Gaṅgā, when they came to him in the form of swans, that he would sustain his life and go to his original place when the sun had turned towards the north 6. 114. 97; he told them that he would sustain his life longing for the Uttarāyaṇa; established in complete sway (over his life), he could control the act of giving up life; he would therefore hold life for some time since he wished to die in the Udagāyana (dhārayiṣyāmy ahaṁ prāṇān uttarāyaṇakāṅkṣayā/aiśvaryabhūtaḥ prāṇānām utsarge niyato hy aham/tasmāt prāṇān dhārayiṣye mumūrṣur udagāyane//) 6. 114. 98 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 119. 106: svasāmarthyena bhūtaḥ prāptaḥ svacchandamṛtyutvāt); Bhīṣma's future death in the Uttarāyaṇa alluded to by Yudhiṣṭhira 12. 291. 4 (āvṛtte bhagavaty arke ganatāsi paramāṁ gatim); Bhīṣma asked Yudhiṣṭhira to come back to him when the sun had returned from the Dakṣiṇāyana and the Uttarāyaṇa had set in 13. 152. 10; when the Uttarāyaṇa set in, Yudhiṣṭhira started from Hāstinapura to meet Bhīṣma (for the remebered what Bhīṣma had told him) 13. 153. 6; Bhīṣma greeted Yudhiṣṭhira and said that the sun had turned back (from the Dakṣināyana) 13. 153. 26; as soon as the sun had returned to its northerly course Bhīṣma, well composed, placed himself in his soul (to he ready to abandon the body) 12. 47. 3; Bhīṣma gave up his life when the Uttarāyaṇa had set in 14. 59. 12.

  Epic events: (1) At the end of the thirteenth year, the Pāṇḍavas gathered together at Upaplavya of Virāṭa and settled down there (tatas trayodaśe varṣe nivṛtte pañca pāṇḍavāḥ/upaplavye virāṭasya samapadyanta sarvaśaḥ//) 4. 67. 14; (upaplavye niviṣṭaḥ…yudhiṣṭhiraḥ) 5. 142. 4; (2) While living there, Arjuna brought to Upaplavya, Janārdana, Abhimanyu and the Dāśārhas from the Ānarta country; many other kings also assembled there; Abhimanyu's marriage with Uttarā took place at Upaplavya 4. 67. 15-19, 25, 34; the city at that time shone as in a great festival and became full of people who were delighted and well nourished (tan mahotsavasaṁkāśaṁ hṛṣṭapuṣtajanāvṛtam/nagaraṁ matsyarājasya śuśubhe bharatarṣabha//) 4. 67. 38; (3) When the Pāṇḍavas were settled in Upaplavya (upaplavye niviṣṭeṣu pāṇḍaveṣu), Duryodhana from Hāstinapura and Arjuna from Upaplavya went independently to see Vāsudeva to seek his help in the battle as they wished to win victory 1. 2. 136 (this is mentioned in the contents of the Udyogaparvan which is a reference to 5. 7. 2-20); (4) After Duryodhana succeeded in tricking Śalya and in extracting a promise from him to fight from his side, the latter went to Upaplavya to report to the Pāṇḍavas what had happened 5. 8. 15; (5) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra was informed that the Pāṇḍavas had resorted to Upaplavya, he sent Saṁjaya to greet them and to seek peace with them (prāptān āhuḥ saṁjaya pāṇḍuputrān upaplavye) 5. 22. 1; 5. 22. 36; Saṁjaya, accordingly, went to Upaplavya to meet the Pāṇḍavas (upaplavyaṁ yayau draṣṭum) 5. 23. 1; (6) Janārdana went from Upaplavya to Hāstinapura to negotiate peace with the Kauravas: on way he had encamped at Vṛkasthala (upaplavyād iha…upayāto janārdanaḥ/vṛkasthale nivasati) 5. 84. 1; (upaplavyāc chāntim icchañ janārdanaḥ/ āgataḥ) 7. 61. 21; on Kṛṣṇa's way from Upaplavya to Hāstinapura people gathered in different towns to see him 5. 82. 18; Kṛṣṇa, without achieving his purpose, returned to Upaplavya when the sun arose (uccaiḥsūryam) and reported to the Pāṇḍavas what happned at Hāstinapura 5. 135. 30; 5. 145. 1; (yadaivākṛtakāryas tvam upaplavyaṁ gataḥ punaḥ) 11. 25. 31; (sa gatvā hāstinapuraṁ dhṛtarāṣṭram sametya ca…/anavāpya śamaṁ tatra kṛṣṇaḥ…/ āgacchata mahābāhur upaplavyam…//) 9. 34. 5-7; (7) When Kṛṣṇa arrived at Upaplavya, Yudhiṣṭhira offered him madhuparka and requested him to protect Arjuna in the battle (upayātam upaplavyam…eṣa bhrātā sakhā caiva tava kṛṣṇa dhanaṁjayaḥ/ rakṣitavyo mahābāho sarvāsv āpatsv iti prabho//) 9. 61. 23-24 (No such specific request is reported earlier in the Udyogaparvan; a general request by Yudhiṣṭhira to protect all the Pāṇḍavas is, however, reported at 5. 70. 4); (8) While at Upaplavya, Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana had assured Yudhiṣṭhira that victory would be on that side which was helped by Kṛṣṇa (yataḥ kṛṣṇas tato jayaḥ) 9. 61. 30; (such a statement by Vyāsa is not found earlier in the Udyogaparvan; however, such statement was made by Saṁjaya to Dhṛtaraṣṭra in Hāstinapura 5. 66. 9 and by Nārada to Arjuna 6. 21. 12, 14; what Vyāsa told Dhṛtarāṣṭra was yato dharmas tato jayaḥ 6. 2. 14; (9) Kṛṣṇa, along with the Pāṇḍavas, left Upaplavya for Kurukṣetra 9. 34. 14; when the Pāṇḍavas with their army started for the battlefield, Draupadī returned to Upaplavya; before leaving, the Pāṇḍavas made arrangements for the defence of their base at Upaplavya by erecting forts and stationing troops all around (upaplavye tu pāñcālī …nivavṛte) 5. 149. 55; (kṛtvā mūlapratīkārān gulmaiḥ sthāvarajaṅgamaiḥ) 5. 149. 56 (Nī. on Bom.

*4th word in left half of page p306  (+offset) in original book.Kali  : m.,  Kaliyuga  nt.: Name of one of the four Yugas or ages; also called  Puṣya  (6. 11. 3-4, 7, 12, 13) and  Tiṣya  (is kalipuraskṛta 12. 327. 76; 12. 337. 42; Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 10. 3. (= Cr. Ed. 6. 11. 3 reads tiṣyam (in place of Cr. Ed. puṣyam) and explains it as kaliyugam). 

  A.   Characterization: Characterized as kṛṣṇayuga (12. 337. 44) and tāmasayuga (3. 148. 33). 

  B.   Place among the four Yugas: Fourth and the last Yuga, hence referred to as the caturtha yuga (yugasya ca caturthasya rājā bhavati kāraṇam) 5. 130. 16; 12. 70. 25, or as paścima yugakāla 3. 189. 13; it comes at the close of the Dvāpara Yuga (saṁkṣepād dvāparasyātha tataḥ puṣyaṁ pravartate) 6. 11. 4; hence referred to after the Dvāpara as apara yuga 12. 259. 32; Hanūmant told Bhīma that the Kaliyuga will commence soon (after the Dvāpara) (eatat kaliyugaṁ nāma acirād yat pravartate) 3. 148. 37; after the Kaliyuga commences again the Kṛtayuga (kṣīṇe kaliyuge caiva pravartati kṛtaṁ yugam) 3. 186. 22. 

  C.   Duration: Mārkaṇḍeya told Yudhiṣṭhira that the Kali Yuga lasts for 1000 years; it is preceded by dawns of 100 years and followed by evenings of equal duration (sahasram ekaṁ varṣāṇāṁ tataḥ kaliyugaṁ smṛtam/tasya varṣaśataṁ saṁdhyā saṁdhyāṁśaś ca tataḥ param/ saṁdhyāsaṁdhyāṁśayos tulyaṁ pramāṇam upadhāraya) 3. 186. 21 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 188. 23: sandhyā pūrvasmin yuge uttarayugadharmāṇām upasarjanatayā saṁkramaḥ/sandhyāṁśas tūttarasmin pūrvayugadharmāṇām); the same duration for Kaliyuga was narrated by Vyāsa to Śuka 12. 224. 20. 

  D.   Events marking the advent of the Kali Yuga: (1) The armies of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas fought each other near the Samantapañcaka at the junction of the Dvāpara and the Kali Yuga (antare caiva saṁprāpte kalidvāparayor abhūt/samantapañcake yuddhaṁ kurupāṇḍavasenayoḥ) 1. 2. 9; (2) Nārāyaṇa told Apāntaratamas that when the Tiṣyayuga will have set in the kings born in the line of Bharata, known as the Kurus, will be born of him (i. e. of Apāntaratamas then born as Vyāsa) and that there will be a feud in the family leading to mutual destruction (here Tiṣya, i. e. Kali, is mentioned in place of Dvāpara due to close proximity ?) (punas tiṣye ca saṁprāpte kuravo nāma bhāratāḥ/bhaviṣyanti mahātmāno rājānaḥ prathitā bhuvi//teṣāṁ tvattaḥ prasūtānāṁ kulabhedo bhaviṣyati/ parasparavināśārthaṁ) 12. 337. 42-43; (3) Nārāyaṇa told Nārada that at the end of the junction of the Dvāpara and the Kali age he would appear in Mathurā for the killing of Kaṁsa (dvāparasya kaleś caiva saṁdhau paryavasānike/prādurbhāvaḥ kaṁsahetoḥ mathurāyāṁ bhaviṣyati) 12. 326. 82; (4) at the end of the Dvāpara and the beginning of the Kali age Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa), along with Saṁkarṣaṇa, is sung according to the Sātvata mode of worship (dvāparasya yugasyānte ādau kaliyugasya ca/sātvataṁ vidhism āsthāya gītaḥ saṁkarṣaṇena yaḥ) 6. 62. 39. 

  E.   Kaliyuga and Nārāyaṇa and Vyāsa: (1) Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that in the Kali Yuga Kṛṣṇa came down to the earth as adharma (kṛṣṇaḥ/kalāv adharmaḥ kṣitim ājagāma 13. 143. 9; Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 158. 10: kalau tv adharma eva balavān iti bhāvaḥ); the god (Nārāyaṇa i. e. KṛṣṇaJanārdana 3. 187. 52, 50) told Mārkaṇḍeya that he has dark colour in the Kaliyuga (kṛṣṇaḥ kaliyuge tathā) 3. 187. 31; tāmasaṁ yugam āsādya kṛṣṇo bhavati keśavaḥ) 3. 148. 33; (2) Hari-Nārāyaṇa told Apāntaratamas (12. 337. 38) that when Kṛṣṇayuga (i. e. Kaliyuga) sets in he (as Vyāsa) will have dark colour (kṛṣṇe yuge ca saṁprāpte kṛṣṇavarṇo bhaviṣyasi) 12. 337. 44. 

  F.   King and the Kali Yuga: All the Yugas are dependent on the king's behaviour, hence a king is called a yuga (rājavṛttāni sarvāṇi rājaiva yugam ucyate) 12. 92. 6; according to Bhīṣma all the Yugas, including Kali, are rooted in a king (rājamūlāni sarvāṇi) 12. 139. 10; it is the king who makes the Yugas what they are and hence he is also the cause of the fourth Yuga (i. e. the Kaliyuga) (yugasya ca caturthasya rājā bhavati kāraṇam) 5. 130. 16; 12. 70. 25; by bringing about the Kali age the king incurs immense sin (kaleḥ pravartanād rājā pāpam atyantam aśnute) 12. 70. 27; by bringing about the Kaliyuga (not directly stated) the evil-doer (i. e. the king) lives eternally in the hell (tato vasati duṣkarmā narake śāśvatīḥ samāḥ) 5. 130. 18; when the king wholly gives up daṇḍanīti and oppresses his subjects unjustly the Kali age makes its appearance (daṇḍanītiṁ parityajya yadā kārtsnyena bhūmipaḥ/prajāḥ kliśnāty ayogena praviśyati tadā kaliḥ) 12. 70. 18; where the sinful ones move about freely among the righteous, there the Kali age (? or the evil spirit ?) meets the kings (? yatra pāpā jñāyamānāś caranti satāṁ kalir vindati tatra rājñāḥ) 12. 92. 27 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 91. 28: rājñaḥ nṛpān). 

  G.   Kali Yuga and dharma: While describing the four Yugas Hanūmant told Bhīma that in the Kali Yuga dharma stands only on one foot (pādenaikena kaunteya dharmaḥ kaliyuge sthitaḥ) 3. 148. 32; (pādena tv apare (i. e. kalau) yuge) 12. 259. 32; (tatas tiṣye 'tha saṁprāpte yuge kalipuraskṛte/ekapādasthito dharmo yatra tatra bhaviṣyati) 12. 327. 76 (however, commentator Vādirāja: tiṣye puṣyanakṣatre, note on this stanza in the Cr. Ed.); 12. 224. 23; gods asked Bhagavān Nārāyaṇa what they should do when the dharma in the Tiṣya Yuga stood on one foot 12. 327. 77; in the Kali Yuga (not directly mentioned) adharma rules over men in three parts while dharma attends men only in one part (tribhir aṁśair adharmas tu lokān ākramya tiṣṭhati/caturthāṁśena dharmas tu manuṣyān upatiṣṭhati) 3. 188. 12; in the Kali Yuga dharma is reduced to its sixteenth kolā on account of the misbehaviour of kings (tathā kaliyuge prāpte rājñāṁ duścaritena ha/bhavet kālaviśeṣṇa kalā dharmasya ṣoḍaśī) 12. 259. 33. 

  H.   Nature of the Kali Yuga and its effects on men: Vedic practices dwindle, so also the religious and the sacrificial rites; on the other hand, seasonal calamities, diseases, lassitude, vices like anger and others, calamities and mental agonies are experienced (vedācārāḥ praśāmyanti dharmayajñakriyās tathā//ītayo vyādhayas tandrī doṣāḥ krodhādayas tathā/upadravāś ca vartante ādhayo vyādhayas tathā// 3. 148. 33-34; also cf. 3. 186. 24-55; 3. 188. 5-6, 13-84; 12. 224. 62; in the Kali Yuga the Vedas are seen (i. e. practised) by some and not by others; they, which alone serve as dams of dharma, fall into ruin along with the sacrifices (dṛśyante nāpi dṛśyante vedāḥ kaliyuge 'khilāḥ/utsīdante sayajñāś ca kevalā dharmasetavaḥ//) 12. 224. 66; 12. 230. 15-17; the study of the Vedas dwindles gradually in each succeeding Yuga (vedavādāś cānuyugaṁ hrasantīti ca naḥ śrutam) 12. 224. 25; the adharma in the Yugas other than the Kṛta is on increase due to the practice of theft, falsehood and deceipt 12. 224. 23; the duties (dharmāḥ) to be followed in the Kali Yuga are different (from those of the other Yugas); they have been prescribed as if keeping in mind the (lowered) capacity of men in that age (anye kaliyuge dharmā yathāśaktikṛtā iva) 12. 224. 26 = 12. 252. 8; giving gifts is specially recommended for the Kali Yuga (dānam eva kalau yuge) 12. 224. 27; in the Kali age adharma is practised by many, and dharma only by a few; all the Varṇas are disinclined to follow dharma proper to them 12. 70. 19; also 20-24; the nature of men in the Puṣyayuga is described also in 6. 11. 12-13; strict adherence to dharma is not to be expected in the Kali Yuga-this is what Kṛṣṇa implied in his words addressed to Balarāma to assuage his wrath (prāptaṁ kaliyugaṁ viddhi) 9. 59. 21; in the Kali age (as in the Dvāpara) it is necessary for people to he paried to beget children (dvāpare maithuno dharmaḥ prajānām abhavan nṛpa/tathā kaliyuge rājan dvandvam āpedire janāḥ//) 12. 200. 37; the ascetics born in the Kali age (as also in the Tretā and the Dvāpara) are beset with doubts (tretāyāṁ dvāpare caiva kalijāś ca sasaṁśayāḥ/tapasvinaḥ) 12. 230. 7; evil tribes like the Talavaras, the Andhrakas and others which originate in the south (dakṣiṇāpathajanmānaḥ) and those like the Yaunas, the Kāmbojas, and other which have their origin in the north (uttarāpathajanmānaḥ) roam on the earth in the Tretā and the following Yugas (i. e. also in the Kali) (tretāprabhṛti vartante te janā bharatarṣabha) 12. 200. 39-42; Dyumatsena told Satyavān that if the Dasyus were not killed then in the Kaliyuga people would say to each other: “this is mine, not his”, it would then be difficult to carry on every day life (mamedam iti nāsyaitat pravarteta kalau yuge/lokayātrā na caiva syāt) 12. 259. 6; if one always recites the description of the origin of cows he is freed of the impurity of the Kali age (? or of evil spirit ?) (imaṁ gavāṁ prabhavavidhānam uttamaṁ paṭhan sadā… vimucyate kalikaluṣeṇa mānavaḥ) 13. 76. 32. 

  I.   Span of life: In the Puṣya (i. e. the Kali) Yuga there is no fixed span of life; people die (even) in the womb or immediately after they are born (na pramāṇasthitir hy asti puṣye 'smin bharatarṣabha garbhasthāś ca mriyante 'tra tathā jātā mriyanti ca//) 6. 11. 7; the life-span, as also other faculties, of human beings decrease surcessively in each following Yuga (āyur vīryam…/ manusyāṇām anuyugaṁ hrasatīti nibodha me//) 3. 188. 13; however, life is expected to be of a hundred years (…tretādiṣv etesāṁ pādaśo hrasate vayaḥ) 12. 224. 24, 25. 

  J.   Kali as a name of Sūrya: Kali occurs among the 108 names of Sūrya taught by Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 3. 20: kaliḥ sarvamalāśraya ity ekaṁ nāma).

Epic events connected with this tithi: (1) When the Pāṇḍavas lived near the river Sarasvatī there occurred the Kārttikī of the autumn season; the Pāṇḍavas spent that night of best conjunction in the company of the holy ascetics and when the darkness set in (tamisrābhyudaye) they, with Dhaumya, went to the Kāmyaka forest 3. 179. 16-18; (2) Vidura reported to Yudhiṣṭhira that Dhṛtarāṣṭra had decided to retire to the forest on the following Kārtikī (gamiṣyati vanaṁ rājan kārtikīm āgatām imām) 15. 17. 3; before setting for the forest Dhṛtarāṣṭra wished to give rich gifts on the Kārtikī (kārtikyām) 15. 19. 15; he gave those gifts for ten days preceding (the Kārttikī) (daśāham evaṁ dānāni dattvā rājāmbikāsutaḥ) 15. 20. 17; gifts given by him detailed in 15. 20. 3-16; the gifts were intended as a śrāddha or an aurdhvadehika for Bhīṣma and the rest 15. 17. 4-5, 9, 17; 15. 19. 11; Dhṛtarāṣṭra thereby wanted to pay back the debt he owed to his sons and friends (babhūva putrapautrāṇām anṛṇo bharatarṣabha) 15. 20. 17; 15. 18. 11; he started for the forest when the Brāhmaṇas, at his instance, offered an iṣṭi on the Kārttikī 15. 21. 2. 

  C.   Bad omens: Among the bad omens reported by Vyāsa to Dhṛtarāṣṭra before the start of the great war one was related to the night of the Kārttikī full moon when the moon having the colour of fire, shining in the sky of the same colour, became lustreless and could not be noticed (alakṣyaḥ prabhayā hīnaḥ paurṇamāsīṁ ca kārttikīm/candro 'bhūd agnivarṇaś ca samavarṇe nabhastale//) 6. 2. 23. 

  D.   Religious importance: (1) Merit of a person who visits Puṣkara on the Kārtikī grows undecayingly 3. 80. 52; spending one full moon Kārtikī night at Puṣkara was equal to offering agnihotra for full hundred years 3. 80. 57; (2) Pilgrims bathe in the river Sarasvatī for a year following the occurrence of the Kārtikī (sarasvatyāṁ mahārāja anu saṁvatsaraṁ hi te/snāyante bharataśreṣṭha vṛttāṁ vai kārtikīṁ sadā) 3. 80. 121; with this bath one shone like a moon and obtained fruit of giving a thousand cows 3. 80. 122; (3) Virūpākṣa, the king of the Rākṣasas used to feed a thousand excellent Brāhmaṇas on the autumnal full moon day of the Kārttika; according to the śruti texts Brāhmaṇas should be given precious stones (ratnāni) on that day; Virūpākṣa assured the Brāhmaṇas that they need have no fear from the Rākṣasas on that one day of Kārttikī and they need not be in a hurry to go away 12. 165. 9, 16, 23; details of how Virūpākṣa honoured Brāhmaṇas 12 165. 10-14, 17-19.

*2nd word in right half of page p342  (+offset) in original book.Garuḍa, Garutmant, Tārkṣya, Vainateya, Suparṇa  : m.: A mythical bird. 

  A.   Origin: (a) According to 1. 2. 73 the origin is narrated in the Āstīkaparvan; mind-born (saṁkalpaja) son of Kaśyapa and Vinatā (1. 27. 27, hence often called Vainateya; also Vinatātmaja, Vinatāsuta, Vinatāsūnu) 1. 14. 6, 8; 1. 27. 2, 27, 34; 1. 59. 39; 1. 60. 67; 5. 103. 10; born from one of the two eggs of Vinatā placed in a warm pot (sopasveda bhāṇḍa) for over a thousand years; as advised by her elder son Aruṇa, Vinatā did not break the egg prematurely 1. 14. 12 14, 19-20; when the proper time came Garuḍa came out of the egg without mother's help 1. 20. 4; as soon as born he left the mother and flew up in the sky, from there to seek his destined food (serpents, hence pannagasūdana) 1. 14. 22-23; as son of Vinatā, he is counted among the six Vainateyas 1. 59. 39; 1. 114. 62; (1. 60. 38); (b) Garuḍa born due to the penance of the Vālakhilyas 1. 27. 27; once Indra disregarded the Vālakhilyas; so they offered a sacrifice to produce another Indra for gods who would be a hundred times more powerful than the then existing Indra 1. 27. 8-14; at the intervention of Kaśyapa Prajāpati, Vālakhilyas agreed to the proposal that the one to be born as a result of their sacrifice would be the ‘Indra’ of the birds 1. 27. 16, 20, 29; hence Garuḍa was consecrated as Indra of birds 1. 27. 35; Rudra gave a boon that the Vālakhilyas will produce by their penance Suparṇa, the bringer of Soma 13. 14. 62-63; (c) At birth, Garuḍa was of big size (mahākāyaḥ), having blazing lustre and looking like a mass of kindled fire 1. 20. 5, 7; all people thought him to be fire; gods and sages requested Agni not to burn the people; they were informed by Agni that the mass of fire was Garuḍa, Agni's equal in lustre 1. 20. 4-8; gods and sages praised Garuḍa, whereupon Garuḍa withdrew his lustre 1. 20. 10-14. 

  B.   Progeny: Suparṇas: six sons of Garuḍa (Vainateya) Sumukha (6. 7. 12) and others, extended the lineage of Suparṇa; these live in the world of Suparṇas with serpents as their food 5. 99. 1; these six are thus the founders of the vinatākula 5. 99. 3. 

  C.   Eminence: Garuḍa compared with Pinākin 1. 28. 20; Upamanyu said that Śiva was Vainateya among the birds 13. 14. 158; as the best among the birds he was counted among the Vibhūtis of Bhagavān 6. 32. 30; Arjuna was like Garuḍa among the birds 6. 116. 32; Vainateya never thought highly of other birds whenever he confronted them 6. 4. 34. 

  D.   Bringer of amṛta (Soma): Some time after his birth Garuḍa approached his mother who, as the slave of Kadrū was on the other side of the ocean; at her instance Vainateya carried on his back serpents near the sun; serpents fainted due to sun's (hot) rays 1. 21. 5-6; when revived at Indra's intervention, Suparṇa carried them to a beautiful forest in an island, and from there to another island 1. 23. 1, 6-7; Garuḍa asked Vinatā why he must do whatever serpents asked him to do; knowing the reason (Vinatā's slavery), Garuḍa asked serpents how his mother could be freed from slavery; serpents asked him to get amṛta for them (1. 23. 1-12); before starting on his expedition, Garuḍa asked Vinatā what he might eat on his way; she asked him to eat the Niṣādas living in Niṣādālaya but warned him never to harm a Brāhmaṇa; Vinatā told Garuḍa how to recognize a Brāhmaṇa; at the time of his departure he was blessed by Vinatā; at Niṣādālaya he opened his beak and ate up those that entered it 1. 24. 1-14; a Brāhmaṇa and his wife inadvertently got into his beak and burnt his throat; Garuḍa opened the beak and let the Brāhmaṇa and his wife, a Niṣādī, slip out, he was blessed by the Brāhmaṇa 1. 25. 1-5; further on his way he met his father Kaśyapa whom he told that he was on his way to get Soma (1. 25. 7; amṛta 1. 25. 9) and asked what else he might eat; Kaśyapa asked him to eat Supratīka, (an elephant) and Vibhāvasu (a tortoise), both of enormous size, and blessed him 1. 25. 7-9, 25; Garuda picked up the elephant and the tortoise (who, according to 5. 107. 16, lived in the south and used to fight with each other) with his nails and went to Alambatīrtha and sat on a Rohiṇa tree to eat the two; the branch gave way under the tremendous weight 1. 25. 27-33; on this branch were the Vālakhilyas; to save them from destruction Garuḍa (Tārkṣya 1. 26. 18) held the branch in his beak and flew around; not finding a place to rest Garuḍa went to his father Kaśyapa on the Gandhamādana mountain; Kaśyapa told the Vālakhilyas that Garuḍa's endeavour was in the interest of the living beings; they left the branch; Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja 1. 26. 15) asked Kaśyapa to direct him to a place, free from Brāhmaṇas, where he might leave the branch; as advised, Garuḍa went to an uninhabited mountain covered with snow and there ate the elephant and the tortoise 1. 26. 1-16; as Garuḍa drew near the place of amṛta, there were bad omens for gods; when Indra enquired the reason, Brahaspati told him that Garuḍa was arriving to fetch Soma 1. 26. 36-37 (called also amṛta 1. 26. 38); Bṛhaspati told the gods that Garuḍa was of incomparable strength and would achieve what was most difficult to achieve (asādhyam api sādhayet) 1. 26. 37; Garuḍa (Garutmart 1. 28. 1; Vainateya 1. 28. 14; Vinatāsuta 1. 28. 20) fought with Bhauvana, the protector of Soma (1. 28. 3), with other gods who were protecting amṛta (1. 28. 6), an with birds (pakṣin) like Aśvakranda, Reṇuka and others; he killed these, and put gods to flight; he fought with wings, beak and nails 1. 28. 1-20; after the fight Garuḍa saw amṛta surrounded by fire; he divided his mouth into ninety times ninety, fetched water in them from rivers, poured it on the fire and pacified it; to enter the fire he became small in size 1. 28. 22-25; near the amṛta he saw a wheel of iron (ayasmaya), of sharp edge, which was a device (yantra) created by gods to cut down those who might try to steal Soma; as he entered through the spokes of the wheel he saw two serpents, with poison in their eyes (cakṣurviṣau), guarding amṛta; anyone seen by them would be reduced to ashes; Suparṇa blinded their eyes with dust and, unseen, he (Vainateya) snatched Soma and flew away quickly; with the force of his speed he uprooted (unmath-) the yantra 1. 29. 2-10; he himself did not taste the amṛta but asked a boon from Viṣṇu that he should become undecaying and immortal without tasting amṛta 1. 29. 11, 14; without going near him Indra struck Garuḍa, as he was taking away amṛta, with his vajra; to respect the sage (Dadhīca 1. 127. 12) from whose bones the vajra was fashioned, the vajra itself, and Indra, Garuḍa released a feather from his wings, as though due to the stroke of vajra, but otherwise was not affected by the vajra 1. 29. 17-20; seeing the feather of excellent form all beings (sarvabhūtāni) said “may this bird be Suparṇa” (surūpaṁ patram ālakṣya suparṇo 'yaṁ bhavatv iti) 1. 29. 21; Indra sought Garuḍa's friendship, and Garuḍa agreed 1. 29. 23; 1. 30. 1 (Kaśyapa had prophesied before Garuḍa's birth that he would be the helper of Indra 1. 27. 30); Indra requested Garuḍa to return Soma, but Garuḍa told him the purpose of taking it away; both hatched a plan-Indra was to take away amṛta once Garuḍa had placed it before the serpents and freed his mother from slavery 1. 30. 7-9; Indra granted Garuḍa a boon, and he chose serpents to be his food 1. 30. 10-12 (hence his epithets like pannagāśana 2. 22. 23; 5. 110. 5, 15; 5. 117. 23; pannagasūdana 1. 14. 22; bhujagendrāri 5. 110. 1; bhujagāri 10. 13. 4); Garuḍa brought amṛta to serpents and placed it for them on the kuśa grass; he asked them to take it after they had bathed and become auspicious (maṅgalasaṁyuktāḥ); he asked serpents to free his mother from slavery from that day; the serpents agreed and went to bathe; Garuḍa (Suparṇa) was happy to roam with his mother Vinatā freely in the forest and to gladden her 1. 30. 14-21 (Aruṇa, Garuḍa's elder brother, had prophesied that Garuḍa would free Vinatā from slavery 1. 14. 18); phalaśruti: One who hears or recites this narrative (kathā) will go to heaven due to his glorifying Garuḍa, the lord of the birds (patagapati) 1. 30. 22. 

  E.   Gālava episode: Gālava was asked by his teacher Viśvāmitra to give him as dakṣiṇā eight hundred moon-like white horses, each having a black ear on one side (5. 104. 26); not knowing how to procure these, Gālava desired to take recourse to Viṣṇu; just then Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja), the friend of Gālava, appeared before him and offered to take him to any place 5. 105. 14-19; Suparṇa described to Gālava the four directions 5. Adh. 106-109; he told Gālava the etymology of the name of the direction uttarā (yasmād uttāryate pāpāt ‘because one is freed there from sin’ 5. 109. 1; also guṇair anyair dig uttarā ‘a direction superior (to others) in different qualities’, and sarvakarmasu cottarā ‘better (than other directions) for performing all rites’ 5. 109. 24); Gālava requested Garuḍa (named variously as Garutmant, Suparṇa, Vinatātmaja, Tārkṣya, Aruṇānuja) to take him to the east; Garuḍa (Vinatāsūnu) agreed and asked Galava to mount him 5. 110. 1-4; unable to stand the speed of Garuḍa, Gālava requested him (Vinatātmaja) not to proceed further but to return to their place 5. 110. 14-15; Gālava told Garuḍa that his real purpose was to obtain the eight hundred horses and since he knew no way to obtain them he thought of giving up his life that way 5. 110. 16-17; Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja) found fault with Gālava for wanting to end his life and told him: “The time of death is not determined by any person, Kāla is rather supreme (na cāpi kṛtrimaḥ kālaḥ kālo hi parameśvaraḥ [Nīla.: kṛtrimaḥ svecchāsampādyaḥ 5. 112. 20 Bom. Ed.]) 5. 110. 19-20; he told Gālava that they would first repair to mountain Ṛṣabha in the heart of the ocean, eat, rest, and then return 5. 110. 22; on the peak of the Ṛṣabha mountain Suparṇa and Gālava met a Brāhmaṇī Śāṇḍilī; they ate the food cooked by her and slept; when Suparṇa woke up he found himself to be just a ball of meat, bereft of wings, with only mouth and feet left; he was reduced to that state because he belittled Śāṇḍilī and had planned to take her away from that place; he begged for forgiveness; Śāṇḍilī relented and told Garuḍa that he would be ‘Suparṇa’ again; Garuḍa got back his wings which were stronger than before (Nīla. draviṇavattarau = balavattarau 5. 113. 17 Bom. Ed.) 5. 111. 17; Śāṇḍilī advised Garuḍa not to despise women at any time even if they deserved to be despised (na ca te garhaṇīyāpi garhaṇīyāḥ striyaḥ kvacit 5. 111. 16) 5. 111. 1-17; when Viśvāmitra, on his way, saw Gālava without the horses he had asked for, he blamed him in the presence of Vainateya and said he would further wait for a period of the same duration as before; Suparṇa, having heard what Viśvāmitra had said, explained to Gālava the importance of gold and wealth (he told him the etymology of the word dhana: dhatte dhārayate cedam etasmāt kāraṇād dhanam 5. 112. 2) and took him to his friend, king Yayāti, for getting wealth to purchase the required horses; when they met Yayāti, Garuḍa (vinatāsuta) requested him on Gālava's behalf to part with some wealth; Garuḍa assured Yayāti that Gālava in return would give him a part of his tapas; Garuḍa told Yayāti that since he was qualified to give a gift and Gālava to receive it his giving gift to Gālava would be like pouring milk in a conch shell (śaṅkhe kṣīram ivāsaktam 5. 112. 20) 5. 111. 18-23; 5. 112. 1-20; Yayāti listened to what Suparṇa had said; he was delighted to meet Tārkṣya, his friend; but Yayāti told him that he was no longer wealthy; however as it was not meet to frustrate the hopes of a viprarṣi, he was prepared to part with his daughter Mādhavī by marrying whom to some king Gālava could acquire wealth as bride price (śulka) to buy the horses; Garuḍa having shown the way to Gālava to acquire the horses left him and went to his residence 5. 113. 1-16; when Gālava had procured six hundred out of the eight hundred required śyāmakarṇa horses, he met Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja) again 5. 116. 21; Garuḍa (Vainateya) heard Gālava's story; he (Suparṇa) told Gālava that he would never find more than six hundred horses as, before him, Ṛcīka did not get more than six hundred horses; Garuḍa advised Gālava to give Mādhavī to Viśvāmitra in lieu of the remaining two hundred horses; Suparṇa then took Gālava, Mādhavī and the six hundred horses to Viśvāmitra; Gālava was thus able to pay the dakṣiṇā his teacher had demanded with the help of Suparṇa; Gālava permitted Suparṇa to leave 5. 117. 1-23. 

  F.   Sumukha (a serpent) episode: Serpent Āryaka told Mātali who wanted his daughter to be married to Sumukha that Cikura, his son, was killed by Vainateya and that the same fate awaited his grand-son Sumukha in a month's time; Mātali assured Āryaka that he would endeavour to mitigate the threat of Suparṇa to Sumukha; when they all approached Indra, Viṣṇu asked Indra to give amṛta to Sumukha and make him immortal; Indra, remembering the prowess of Vainateya, was reluctant to part with amṛta and asked Viṣṇu himself to give it to Sumukha; when asked by Viṣṇu again, Indra gave only long life to Cikura but not amṛta 5. 102. 14-27; 5. 101. 24. 

  G.   Association with Viṣṇu: (1) As standing on his flag-staff and as his vehicle: While fetching amṛta from heaven, Vainateya met Viṣṇu on way; when offered a boon by Viṣṇu, Garuḍa chose that he should stay above Viṣṇu (tava tiṣṭheyam upari); when Garuḍa in return offered a boon to Viṣṇu, he chose Garuḍa to serve him as his vehicle (vāhana), and since Garuḍa wanted to stand above him Viṣṇu asked Garuḍa to stand on his flag-staff (dhvajaṁ ca cakre) 1. 29. 12-16; hence after the death of Jarāsandha when Kṛṣṇa thought of Garuḍa (Garutmant), he instantly appeared and took his seat on (the flag-staff of) the chariot; the flag-staff then appeared as a raised caitya post 2. 22. 2223; Kṛṣṇa's flag marked with Garuḍa when he started for Hāstinapura 5. 81. 20; when Dāruka brought Kṛṣṇa's chariot for the use of Sātyaki it was marked with Suparṇa 7. 122. 43; also 7. 56. 33 (Vainateya); when Kṛṣṇa got his chariot ready to pursue Aśvatthāman, Vainateya stood on the flag-staff 10. 13. 4; when, at the end, the Vṛṣṇis were helplessly looking on, Suparṇa on the flag of Kṛṣṇa was taken away day and night by the Apsaras 16. 4. 5; Kṛṣṇa (Viṣṇu) is called Garuḍadhvaja 7. 57. 2; 13. 11. 5; 13. 135. 51; Suparṇaketu 3. 173. 15; Tārkṣyaketana 2. 2. 12; 12. 48. 14; Tārkṣyapravaraketana 2. 42. 55; Tārkṣyadhvaja 8. 27. 65; (also cf. 12. 46. 34); Tārkṣyalakṣaṇa 12. 43. 8; Kṛṣṇa used Vainateya as his vehicle while fetching Pārijāta from Amarāvatī 7. 10. 22; he used Tārkṣya as vehicle while going to Himavant to propitiate Śiva 13. 14. 26 and Vainateya while waiting on him 13. 14. 142; Garuḍa felt he was disregarded by Indra because he stood on the flag of Indra's younger brother and because he carried him (Kṛṣṇa) on his back and was thus reduced to the state of a servant 5. 103. 13, 8; Viṣṇu asked Garutmant to bring king Vasu Uparicara from Pātāla and make him a khecara 12. 324. 30-35; (2) Removal of Garuḍa's pride: When Garuḍa knew that Indra had granted long life to the serpent Sumukha he blamed Indra for depriving him of his food; he threatened to give up his life and said that as long as Indra was there he had nothing to do with Viṣṇu (na viṣṇuḥ kāraṇaṁ mama) 5. 103. 1-17; Viṣṇu scolded Garuḍa (Tārkṣya, Garutmant) for praising himself although in reality he was very weak; Viṣṇu told Garuḍa that he did not really carry Viṣṇu but Viṣṇu carried himself and also Garuḍa (aham evātmanātmānaṁ vahāmi tvāṁ ca dhāraye 5. 103. 20); however he asked Garuḍa to carry only his right arm, and when the arm was placed on Garuḍa he fell down under its weight and became almost unconscious (vicetāḥ); he shed many feathers; Viṣṇu did not deprive him of his life; finally Garuḍa bowed down to Viṣṇu and begged for forgiveness 5. 103. 18-30. 

  H.   Association with Śeṣa: Śeṣa complained to Pitāmaha that his dull-witted brothers (serpents) hated their brother (cousin) Vainateya and he in turn hated them 1. 32. 10-11; Pitāmaha then made Garuḍa (Suparṇa, Vainateya) a friend of Śeṣa 1. 32. 25. 

  I.   Association with Skanda: Suparṇa gave Skanda a feather and a peacock as toy (krīḍanīya) 13. 86. 20-21; he gave peacock to Skanda 9. 45. 46; he attended Skanda's consecration as general of the army 9. 44. 14; some of the warriors of Skanda were Garuḍa-faced (garuḍānanāḥ) 9. 44. 79. 

  J.   Garuḍa's other feats: (1) Suparṇa swallowed a quail which, however, was freed by Aśvinau 1. 3. 62; (2) Garutmant often went to the mountain Himavant 12. 314. 6; Suparṇa once carried away forcibly the big snake Ṛddhimant living near a lake on the Gandhamādana mountain; the wonderful feat (adbhutam) was witnessed by the Pāṇḍavas 3. 157. 14-15; (3) A serpent (not named), husband of the daughter of Airāvata, killed by Suparṇa 6. 86. 7; (4) Suparṇa (and Suparṇas) fought with Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna who protected the fire at Khāṇḍava; he fought with wings, beak, and nails 1. 218. 19-20; 8. 63. 68 (nakha, daśana (? for beak); (5) During his fight with demons (Daiteyas) he performed the great feat of killing six of them 5. 103. 11-12. 

  K.   Strength: Indra described Garuḍa as a great being (mahad bhūtam) and wished to know the extent of his strength (1. 29. 22, 23); Garuḍa said that although good persons did not themselves describe their strength and virtues he would do so due to his friendship with Indra; Garuḍa could carry the whole earth with mountains etc., the worlds, even with Śakra, with only a quill of his feather (pakṣanāḍī), and this without feeling fatigue 1. 30. 2-5; also cf. 1. 20. 10-14; 1. 26. 6-9; 5. 103. 10-11, 17. 

  L.

*4th word in left half of page p355  (+offset) in original book.Jaya  : m.: Name of a type of Itihāsa (jayo nāmetihāso 'yam) 1. 56. 19; 5. 134. 17; 18. 5. 39.

  Usually this is considered to be the designation of that text which was originally composed by Vyāsa and later, with gradual additions, grew to become the Bhārata and the Mahābhārata at the hands of Vaiśāṁpāyana and Sūta Ugraśravas respectively; as the name of the Mahābhārata it probably occurs in the opening maṅgala śloka found at the beginning of the different parvans (nārāyaṇaṁ namaskṛtya naraṁ caiva narottamam/ devīṁ sarasvatīṁ caiva tato   jayam   udīrayet//) which is not found in all the versions; according to V. S. Sukthankar, however, “…Jaya is a generic name applicable to different works, and not a specific name of the Mahābhārata at all as believed by some writers” (Ādiparvan, p. 989, note on 56. 19); the recitation of this kind of Itihāsa should be heard by a king who desires victory; he then conquers the earth and shall defeat his enemies; it should also often be heard by a chief queen since it is as good as a rite calculated to lead to the birth of a son (puṁsavanam) and by a crown prince since it is the royal road to welfare (svastyayanaṁ mahat) 1. 56. 19-20; its recitation is recommended for a king desiring prosperity (bhūtim), for princes in general, and for any pregnant woman; it is also said that hearing it one who desires heaven will go to heaven, one who wants victory will win victory, and a pregnant woman will deliver a son or a fortunate girl (putraṁ kanyāṁ vā bahubhāginīm) 18. 5. 39-40; the narrative called the Vidurāputrānuśāsana (5. 131-135) is also classed as the Jaya type of Itihāsa 5. 134. 17; a minister should recite this to a king who is oppressed by his enemies and who is dejected since this tract, being a powerful exhortation, is best suited to cause increase in energy (idam uddharaṇaṁ bhīmaṁ tejovardhanam uttamam); the rest of the śravaṇaphala given here is the same as for the Mahābhārata (as a Jaya type of composition) with the addition which gives the qualities of the son to be born to a woman 5. 134. 16-21.

  A.   Family: Younger sister (anujā svasā) of Vāsuki 1. 13. 34. 

  B.   Marriage: She was to be given in marriage to sage Jaratkāru as alms (bhaikṣavat) when he came begging (for a girl of his name); this was originally the suggestion made by Brahmā to gods for saving serpents and it was reported to Vāsuki by Elāpatra 1. 34. 9-18; 1. 49. 13; this was told again by Brahmā to Vāsuki 1. 35. 8-11; so Vāsuki kept Jaratkāru without marrying her to any one 1. 13. 34; 1. 35. 2; when sage Jaratkāru announced his decision to marry a girl of his name, Vāsuki was informed of it by his serpent attendants; Vāsuki adorned his sister, told the sage that she had the same name as his, and assured him to maintain her even after marriage; sage Jaratkāru agreed to marry her; she was given as alms (bhaikṣavat) and with due rites 1. 42. 14-20; 1. 43. 1-4; 1. 13. 30-34, 36-37. 

  C.   Dutiful wife: The sage lived with his wife at the residence of Vāsuki; she agreed to her husband's condition (samaya) not to do anything that would displease him and that if she did he would leave her; 1. 43. 7-9; once when she had bathed after her period she lay with her husband and conceived a child 1. 43. 11-12; after a few days when the sage had slept with his head on Jaratkāru's lap the sun was about to set; Jaratkāru awakened her husband for the evening rites; the angered sage got ready to leave her as his wife had displeased him; she told him that she woke him up not out of disregard but to save him from violating dharma. 

  D.   Concern for kinsmen: She pleaded with the sage not to leave her until she bore him a son as she was anxious for the welfare of her kinsmen; the child she had already conceived might not be a son (avyaktarūpaṁ garbham 1. 43. 36); the sage thereupon assured his wife that she would give birth to a fire-like, learned son 1. 43. 13-39; Jaratkāru informed her brother Vāsuki about the sudden departure of her husband; Vāsuki was scared but Jaratkāru told him about the assurance her husband gave her and that he had never told a lie before 1. 44. 1-13. 

  E.   Birth of Āstīka: Vāsuki honoured his pregnant sister in all ways, and at proper time Jaratkāru gave birth to a child of divine lustre (devagarbhābha) 1. 44. 15-17; he was named Āstīka 1. 44. 20; 1. 13. 37. 

  F.   Snake sacrifice: Vāsuki, terrified at the destruction of snakes in the snake sacrifice of Janamejaya, went to Jaratkāru and reminded her of the purpose for which she was married to sage Jaratkāru; he asked her to tell her son Āstīka to intervene and stop the snake sacrifice 1. 48. 20-26; Jaratkāru informed Āstīka why she was married to his father and asked him to stop the sacrifice 1. 49. 1-16; Āstīka assured Jaratkāru that he would fulfil the purpose of his birth 1. 49. 17; on completing his mission Āstīka informed his mother (and Vāsuki) what had happened at the snake sacrifice 1. 53. 17. 

  G.   Reward: Since Jaratkāru saved the life of snakes her name appeared in the mantra to be recited for obtaining protection from serpents 1. 53. 22.

they also fled in different directions (dakṣiṇā ye ca pāñcālāḥ…tathottarāṁ diśam āśritāḥ//…tathaiva sarvapāñcālā jarāsandhabhayārditāḥ//svarāṣṭraṁ saṁparityajya vidrutāḥ sarvatodiśam//) 2. 13. 26-28; (11) Bhīmasena, in his expedition to the east (yayau prācīṁ diśaṁ prati 2. 26. 1; also 2. 23. 9); before the Rājasūya, won over Pāñcālas by various means of conciliation (pāñcālān vividhopāyaiḥ sāntvayām āsa) 2. 26. 3; this event is referred to later in 4. 5. 19 where, however, it is said that he defeated them in battle (pāñcālān…saṁgrāme bhīmaseno'jayat); Pāñcālas did not pay tribute for Rājasūya because they had marriage-relationship with Pāṇḍavas (vaivāhikena pāñcālāḥ) 2. 48. 42; (12) Vidura told Kauravas that Pāñcālas would not forgive the torture to Draupadī (in the Sabhā); Arjuna, protected by Pāñcālas, would invade them 2. 72. 29-30; (13) Pāñcālas meeting the Pāṇḍavas in the forest (3. 13. 2) referred to in the narration of the contents of the Āraṇyakaparvan 1. 2. 106; (14) Draupadī complained to Kṛṣṇa that though Pāñcālas were alive Kauravas desired to treat Draupadī as a Dāsī 3. 13. 56; (15) Dhṛtarāṣṭra was afraid that later Pāñcālas, protected by Kṛṣṇa, would burn the Kaurava army 3. 48. 6;

(18) Before the ajñātavāsa, Yudhiṣṭhira asked the women who attended on Draupadī, as also cooks and chief cooks, to go to the Pāñcāla country 4. 4. 4; (19) According to Draupadī, the affliction she had to suffer while living as Sairandhrī meant insult to Kurus and Pāñcālas 4. 19. 11; (20) Karṇa told Bhīṣma that Pāṇḍavas were claiming their share because they depended on the force of Pāñcālas and Matsyas (rājyam icchanti paitṛkam/balam āśritya matsyānāṁ pāñcālānāṁ ca) 5. 21. 11; (21) Yudhiṣṭhira could have resorted to war without going into exile since the Pāñcālas were always available to him for guidance (nityaṁ pāñcālāḥ sacivās taveme) 5. 27. 17; (22) By avoiding war, Yudhiṣṭhira wished Pāñcālas to meet Kurus with a smile; he desired both of them to remain uninjured and, well-disposed, live in peace (akṣatān kurupāñcālān paśyema… sarve sumanasas tāta śāmyāma) 5. 31. 2122; (23) Saṁjaya told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas were waiting for the orders of Yudhiṣṭhira (rājño mukham udīkṣante); they, riding chariots, greeted him when he approached them 5. 49. 4-7; Saṁjaya also told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāñcālas did not honour him and that they despised him (nārhanti pāñcālāś…sarve tvām avajānate) 5. 53. 17;

that was his responsibility (tatas tad astram mama sāvaśeṣaṁ/tasmāt samartho 'smi mamaiṣa bhāraḥ//…tam ṛṣiprasādam avāpya pāñcālaº…/nihatya) 5. 61. 4-5 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 5. 62. 4: sāvaśeṣaṁ mama āyur asti/ato 'ntakālasyānupasthitatvāt tad astraṁ mamāstīty ahaṁ samartho 'smi); (28) Yudhiṣṭhira, although backed by Pāñcālas and others, chose to ask for five villages 5. 70. 14; (29) Even when Pāñcālas were alive, Draupadī was looked upon as a dāsī in the Sabhā of the wretched Kauravas 5. 80. 25; (30) Kṛṣṇa told Karṇa that the Pāñcālas and others would consecrate him as king; Pāñcālas would follow him in his procession 5. 138. 16-17, 23; (31) Vidura told Kuntī that Yudhiṣṭhira was supported by Pāñcālas 5. 142. 3; there was nothing more painful to Kuntī than Pāñcālas and others fighting with Bhāratas 5. 142. 3, 12; (32) When Pāñcālas proceeded towards Kurukṣetra, they were led by Bhīmasena 5. 149. 50; (33) Duryodhana and others were to kill Pāñcālas in battle 5. 162. 22; Droṇa was to burn Pāñcālas (pradhakṣyati sa pāñcālān) 5. 164. 20; Pāñcālas would run in all directions when they encountered Karṇa 5. 165. 21; (34) Pāñcālas and Prabhadrakas formed the army of Śikhaṇḍin 5. 168. 3; (35) Hiraṇyavarman's friends wanted to kill Drupada and instal another king in the Pāñcāla country if Śikhaṇḍin proved to be a girl 5. 191. 8; (36) Saṁjaya reported that Bhīṣma showered arrows on Pāñcālas 6. 15. 25; on the first day of war, Bhīṣma's chariot moved very often among Pāñcālas and he killed them 6. 45. 4, 54; (37) On the second day, Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to take him to Bhīṣma since Droṇa and others, protected by Bhīṣma, would kill Pāñcālas 6. 48. 15 (13); Pāñcālas cheered loudly when Dhṛṣṭadyumna cut off a fierce and shining arrow discharged at him by Droṇa 6. 49. 13; Bhīma was honoured by Pāñcālas when he killed Kaliṅga warriors 6. 50. 110 (108); (38) On the third day, Pāñcālas stood in the middle of the Ardhacandravyūha of the Pāṇḍavas 6. 52. 14, 10; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya how the Pāñcālas fared against Bhīṣma 6. 55. 2; seeing the river of blood made to flow by Arjuna's sharp arrows, Pāñcālas delightfully raised a loud roar 6. 55. 126, (121125); (39) On the fourth day, the chief warriors of Pāñcālas stood at the same place of the same vyūha as they did on the previous day 6. 56. 11; when Bhīṣma and others marched to help Bhagadatta, Pāñcālas and others chased them; since Bhīṣma did not like to continue fighting with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas and others he thought of declaring the end of the war for that day 6. 60. 64, 68; (40) On the fifth day, although Pāñcālas were getting killed by Bhīṣma, they rushed at him with spirited mind (āryāṁ yuddhe matiṁ kṛtvā) 6. 68. 31;

he cut off their hands and heads and broke their chariots; those who fought from horsebacks also lost their heads 6. 84. 3-6; Bhīṣma strove to kill Pāñcālas while Arjuna fought with their adversaries to protect them 6. 89. 9; when Bhagadatta wanted to reach Yudhiṣṭhira, he had to fight a fierce battle with Pāñcālas who were prepared to fight with weapons (udyatāyudhaiḥ) 6. 91. 80; on the night of that day, Duryodhana reminded Bhīṣma of his vow to kill Pāñcālas 6. 93. 37; Bhīṣma assured Duryodhana that he would kill all Pāñcālas who were taking part in the war or would get himself killed by them 6. 94. 14-15; (44) On the ninth day, Duryodhana told Duḥśāsana that if they protected Bhīṣma, he would kill Pāñcālas who had made a common cause with Pāṇḍavas (yattān pāñcālān pāṇḍavaiḥ saha) 6. 101. 4; (45) On the tenth day, Dhṛṣṭadyumna, protected by Pāñcālas, stood behind Sātyaki and Cekitāna in the Sarvaśatrunibarhaṇavyūha of Pāṇḍavas; Bhīṣma rushed towards them 6. 104. 4, 6, 29; Pāñcālas tried to check Bhīṣma who was killing his opponents 6. 105. 8; Bhīṣma dried up the lustre of the eminent and very strong Pāñcāla princes (pāñcālānāṁ ca ye śreṣṭhā rājaputrā mahābalāḥ/teṣāṁ ādatta tejāṁsi) 6. 105. 31; Bhīṣma suggested to Yudhiṣṭhira, who was close to him, that if he desired Bhīṣma to be killed, Arjuna, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas should jointly lead the attack on him; accordingly Arjuna, along with Pāñcālas and Cedis, and led by Śikhaṇḍin, marched towards Bhīṣma 6. 111. 15, 26; Bhīṣma in his battle with Matsyas and Pāñcālas, alone, killed innumerable elephants and horses, seven great chariot-fighters, and in addition five thousand chariot-fighters and fourteen thousand footsoldiers 6. 113. 21-22; when Bhīṣma killed seven great chariot-fighters, there arose a great roar (kilakilāśabdaḥ) among Pāñcālas and others who, riding horses, chariots, elephants, and also those who fought on foot attacked Bhīṣma 6. 113. 46-48; when Bhīṣma fell, Pāñcālas blew conches 6. 114. 107; at his fall in the evening of the tenth day (sāyāhne) Pāñcālas were delighted 6. 115. 7; (46) In the summary narration of the events which occurred while Droṇa was the general of the Kaurava army, it is mentioned that the large army of Pāñcālas was scattered by Droṇa when he agitated it and penetrated it (saṁkṣobhyamāṇā droṇena bhidyamānā mahācamūḥ); they, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, trembled (samakampanta) while they got killed by Droṇa 7. 6. 34, 36; whenever Pāñcālas attacked Droṇa he killed them along with their horses and broke their chariots; ultimately Pāñcālas killed Droṇa by doing evil and cruel deeds (pāñcālair aśivaiḥ krūrakarmabhiḥ/hato rukmaratho rājan kṛtvā karma suduṣkaram//) 7. 7. 20-21, 32; (47) On the eleventh day, Pāñcālas attacked the warriors led by Aśvatthāman who attacked Draupadī's sons 7. 15. 11; at the end of that day, they praised Arjuna when he declared the end of the war for the day 7. 15. 50; (48) On the twelfth day, Pāñcālas attacked Droṇa; he scattered them away and repeatedly defeated them 7. 20. 18-19, 23; when a Pāñcāla prince (pāñcālya, not named) was killed by Droṇa, Pāñcālas attacked Droṇa shouting ‘kill Droṇa, kill Droṇa’; in the fierce battle, Droṇa threw the excessively angered Pāñcālas (bhṛśasaṁkruddhān) into disorder 7. 20. 46, 48-49; Pāñcālas, getting killed by Droṇa, trembled (samakampanta) 7. 20. 53; they were broken (bhagna) by Droṇa 7. 21. 1; pierced by Droṇa's arrows, they were thrown back from their positions (calitān); Duryodhana pointed out to Karṇa Droṇa's feat and described the plight of Pāñcālas 7. 21. 7, 11-14; Pāñcālas gathered around Bhīma 7. 21. 23; of the twelve thousand great warriors of Pāñcālas six thousand followed Śikhaṇḍin 7. 22. 14; the remaining six thousand Prabhadrakas (Pāñcālas), riding chariots, with raised weapons and stretched bows, and making death as their common goal (samānamṛtyavo bhūtvā) followed Dhṛṣṭadyumna 7. 22. 36-37; Bhagadatta was encircled by Yudhiṣṭhira and Pāñcālas; Bhagadatta, riding his elephant, scattered them away; he forced them to run away 7. 25. 24, 26, 41; Pāñcālas, shouting ‘(attack) Droṇa’ (droṇam droṇam iti…pāñcālāḥ samacodayan) incited one other; wherever Droṇa attacked the group of Pāñcāla chariotfighters, Dhṛṣṭadyumna went to their help 7. 30. 6, 8; althogh afflicted by Droṇa's arrows (śarārtāḥ), Pāñcālas did not give up fighting with him; Droṇa killed many of them 7. 31. 38-39; (49) On the thirteenth day, Pāñcālas, checked by Droṇa's arrows could not approach him who was protecting Kaurava army; that was a wonderful feat (tad adbhutam apaśyāma…/yad enaṁ nābhyavartanta pāñcālāḥ…) 7. 34. 10; Bhīma assured Abhimanyu that he, Pāñcālas and others would follow him when he entered the Cakravyūha 7. 34. 22; Duḥśāsana told Duryodhana that he would kill Abhimanyu in the presence of Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas 7. 38. 22; when Duḥśāsana swooned in his encounter with Abhimanyu, Pāñcālas raised a loud roar; led by Yudhiṣṭhira they then attacked Droṇa's army 7. 39. 17-18; Pāñcālas and others attacked Jayadratha who foiled their attempt to follow Abhimanyu 7. 42. 18; Arjuna would have himself protected Abhimanyu if he had konwn that Pāñcālas could not do that 7. 50. 74; Subhadrā wondered who could kill Abhimanyu as though he was helpless when heroic Pāñcālas were there to help him 7. 55. 9; she felt contempt for the strength of Pāñcālas (pāñcālānāṁ ca dhig balam) 7. 55. 12; (50) Saṁjaya told the grieving Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas would (at the end of the war) realize that the calamity was due to his failure to adopt the right course (tat te buddhivyabhīcāram upalapsyanti…/pāñcālā…) 7. 62. 7; (51) On the fourteenth day, Pāñcālas fought a fierce battle with Kurus in front of the vyūha of Droṇa; Droṇa and many other kings on the side of Kauravas checked the onward march of Pāñcālas; when Kaurava army was being killed by Pāṇḍavas, Droṇa scattered away Pāñcālas with arrows 7. 70. 3, 13-14, 27; Pāñcāla chariot-fighters saved Dhṛṣṭadyumna from the attack of Droṇa 7. 72. 35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya what did the Pāñcālas do when in their attempt to get close to Arjuna, they were checked by Droṇa (bhāradvājena saṁvṛtāḥ); Saṁjaya told him that in the afternoon of that day Kurus and Pāñcālas fought each other with Droṇa as the bet (aparāhṇe mahārāja saṁgrāme…/pāñcālānāṁ kurūṇāṁ ca droṇe dyūtam avartata//); Pāñcālas, wanting to kill Droṇa showered arrows on him; in the fierce battle, Pāñcālas, wanting to break the army, used important missiles (tadanīkaṁ bibhitsanto mahāstrāṇi vyadarśayan) 7. 81. 1-5; demon Alambusa made a river of blood flow carrying away (dead) Pāñcālas 7. 83. 30; Droṇa killed twentyfive Pāñcāla warriors, known as great chariot-fighters and honoured by Dhṛṣṭadyumna (mahārathasamākhyātā dhṛṣṭadyumnasya saṁmatāḥ); he killed choice Pāñcāla warriors (pāñcālānāṁ…varān varān) 7. 85. 28-29; when Droṇa defeated hundreds and thousands of Pāñcālas and killed many of them there went up a cry (of grief) (teṣām samabhavac chabdo vadhyatāṁ droṇasāyakaiḥ) 7. 85. 31-32; gods, Gandharvas and others who were watching the battle pointed out to one another the running away Pāñcālas 7. 85. 33; in the absence of Sātyaki, Yudhiṣṭhira was to be protected by Pāñcālas and others 7. 86. 45; Pāñcālas, when they faced Kṛtavarman, were attacked by him; hence they lost enthusiasm (vigatotsāhāḥ); but soon, like noble men, were ready to fight again desirous of attaining great fame (atiṣṭhann āryavad vīrāḥ prārthayanto mahad yaśaḥ) 7. 88. 57-59 (Nī. on Bom.

Ed. 7. 125. 52: ūrugrāhaḥ ūrustambhaḥ); when Cekitāna's charioteer was killed, Pāñcālas were afraid; Droṇa made them run away 7. 101. 67-68; when Pāñcāla army was reduced in number by Droṇa, Yudhiṣṭhira did not know who could go to save them 7. 102. 3-4; when the vyūhas of Pāṇḍavas were put into disorder, Pāñcālas and Pārthas went back a long way (vyūheṣv āloḍyamāneṣu pāṇḍavānāṁ tatas tataḥ/ sudūram anvayuḥ pārthāḥ pāñcālāḥ saha somakaiḥ//) 7. 102. 1; when Bhīma started to help Arjuna, Pāñcālas followed him 7. 102. 67: Droṇa wanted to remain at his place to check the advancing Pāñcālas 7. 105. 21; Dhṛtarāṣṭra told Saṁjaya that if ever Pāñcālas were to fight with Bhīma they would not be able to protect their lives (na bhīmamukhasaṁprāpto mucyeteti matir maṃa/…na pāñcālā…jānanti yudhi saṁrabdhā jīvitaṁ parirakṣitum) 7. 110. 22-23; Duryodhana pointed out to Droṇa, Śikhaṇḍin who led the Pāñcāla army 7. 125. 11; he told Droṇa that either he would kill Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas or else get killed by them 7. 125. 25; Droṇa felt himself sinking in the sin of Dhṛṣṭadyumna since he had not yet killed him, Śikhaṇḍin and Pāñcālas (majjantam iva cātmānaṁ dhṛṣṭadyumnasya kilbiṣe); he could not take off his armour until he had killed Pāñcālas 7. 126. 25, 32; (52) In the fierce battle that was fought during the night between fourteenth and fiftteenth day the reporters on the battlefield like Saṁjaya could distinguish the Pāñcālas from Kurus only by hearing their personal names and the names of their respective gotras and families (gotrānāṁ nāmadheyānāṁ kulānāṁ caiva tuāriṣa/śravaṇād dhi vijānīmaḥ pāñcālān kurubhiḥ saha//); Pāñcālas fled in all directions when they were being killed by Duryodhana 7. 128. 2, 8, 17; at that time Pāñcālas led by Bhīma attacked Duryodhana; when deeply wounded, Duryodhana sat down in his chariot, Pāñcālas felt he was dead and delightfully they raised a loud cry 7. 128. 21, 23; when Duryodhana attacked Yudhiṣṭhira, Pāñcālas advanced towards him; Droṇa faced them 7. 128. 33; Drupada, protected by Pāñcālas turned towards Droṇa; six thousand Pāñcālas, led by Śikhaṇḍin, rushed towards Droṇa 7. 129. 8, 10; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya when Droṇa, after the death of Jayadratha and Bhūriśravas, attacked Pāñcālas, what did Arjuna do ? when Droṇa entered the Pāñcāla army, how was he (later) killed ? 7. 130. 3, 7; when Droṇa used Vāyavyāstra, Pāñcālas ran away due to fear; but when Bhīma and Arjuna invaded the Kaurava army, Pāñcālas followed them 7. 132. 38, 41; Karṇa asked Duryodhana to save the Kaurava warriors attacked on all sides by Pāñcālas and others; Pāñcāla chariotfighters, feeling victorious and delighted, were making loud sound; he assured Duryodhana that he would kill Pāñcālas who had come forward to fight 7. 133. 3, 4, 6, 11; the victorious Pāñcālas raised a cry seeing Karṇa engaged in battle with Pāṇḍavas; Duryodhana asked his army to stand still for he was going to kill the attacking Pāñcālas; he also requested Aśvatthāman to kill Pāñcālas since they, feeling victorious, moved in the Kaurava army like forest-fire; Aśvatthāman was born for killing Pāñcālas and make the world devoid of them; that was declared by the Siddhas, and it was bound to be true (kariṣyasi jagat sarvam apāñcālaṁ kilācyuta/evaṁ siddhābruvan vāco bhaviṣyati ca tat tathā/); Pāñcālas would not be able to withstand the astras of Aśvatthāman 7. 134. 11, 54, 76-77, 79-81; Aśvatthāman assured Duryodhana that he would fight with Pāñcālas for Duryodhana's delight; they would run away in all directions when burnt down by his arrows; when Yudhiṣṭhira would see Pāñcālas dead, he would be dejected; Aśvatthāman then challenged Pāñcālas to steady themselves and fight with him; he asked their great chariot-fighters to strike him showing their skill in the use of astras (praharadhvam itaḥ sarve mama gātre mahārathāḥ/sthirībhūtāś ca yudhyadhvaṁ darśayanto 'stralāghavam//); when addressed, Pāñcālas showered weapons (arrows ?) on Aśvatthāman (śastravṛṣṭim apātayan); Aśvatthāman repulsed the arrows and killed ten heroes in the presence of Pāṇḍavas and Dhṛṣtadyumna; when Pāñcālas were getting killed, they ran away in all directions; seeing that, Dhṛṣṭadyumna rushed at Aśvatthāman; in the duel that ensued, Dhṛṣṭadyumna was covered on all sides by the entire Pāñcāla army; Aśvatthāman, by his well-joined arrows, forced hundreds and thousands of Pāñcālas to flee (bāṇaiḥ saṁnataparvabhiḥ); he killed a hundred Pāñcālas with a hundred arrows (śatena ca śataṁ hatvā), and three great chariot-fighters with three sharp arrows (tribhiś ca niśitair bāṇair hatvā trīn vai mahārathān); he thus killed a large number of those Pāñcālas who were prepared for fight (nāśayām āsa pāñcālān bhūyiṣṭhaṁ ye vyavasthitāḥ); Pāñcālas, thus getting killed, left Aśvatthāman and went away with their chariots and banners shattered; Aśvatthāman having defeated his enemies, uttered a loud roar 7. 135. 10, 11, 13; 16-21; 36, 47, 49-52; Droṇa used vāyavyāstra against Pāñcālas; getting killed, they ran away; when Bhīma and Arjuna attacked the left and the right flank respectively (bībhatsur dakṣiṇaṁ pārśvam uttaraṁ tu vṛkodaraḥ), great chariot-fighters among Pāñcālas followed them; Droṇa blew away (vyadhamat) the Pāṇḍava army and Pāñcālas at the start of the night (rajanīmukhe) 7. 136. 11, 14; 7. 137. 51; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya, when Droṇa entered the Pāñcāla army and burnt their hosts of chariots who protected him on all the four sides 7. 139. 12-14; when Pāñcālas and Kauravas killed one another they raised a fierce sound (āsīn niṣṭānako ghoro nighnatām itaretaram) 7. 139. 32; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Pāñcālas and others to attack Droṇa to kill him; then, raising fearful cries they attacked him 7. 140. 2-3; when Aśvatthāman swooned while fighting with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas raised a loud roar 7. 141. 32; when Duryodhana, while fighting with Bhīma, lost his charioteer and horses, he was considered dead; Pāñcālas then attacked Droṇa 7. 141. 60; after defeating Sahadeva, Karṇa turned towards Pāñcālas 7. 142. 16; when Śikhaṇḍin was defeated by Kṛpa. Pāñcālas covered him on all sides 7. 144. 27; they also covered him when he attacked Droṇa 7. 145. 3; in the great battle that followed between the two heroes, Pāñcālas also took part 7. 145. 68; when Sātyaki and Duryodhana were engaged in battle, there was confused and fierce fighting between Bhāratas and Pāñcālas (tataḥ samabhavad yuddham ākulam…/pāñcālānāṁ ca sarveṣāṁ bhāratānāṁ ca dāruṇam//) 7. 146. 17; incited by Duryodhana, Droṇa fought fiercely and started killing Pāñcālas; then they raised a tumultuous cry; when they were broken and shattered, dejected Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna their plight 7. 147. 15, 22-23; he advised Arjuna to assist their great chariot-fighters, as well as Bhīma, to give encouragement to the entire army (āśvāsanārthaṁ sarveṣāṁ sainyānām) 7. 147. 29; Karṇa oppressed the great chariotfighters among Pāñcālas (pāñcālānāṁ mahārathān/abhyapīḍayat); pressed hard by Karṇa, the large Pāñcāla army ran away (sā pīḍyamānā tu karṇena pāñcālānāṁ mahācamūḥ/saṁprādravat susaṁtrastā); their warriors fell down from horses, elephants and chariots; Karṇa cut off their hands, heads and thighs; Droṇa assisted him 7. 148. 9-19; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Ghaṭotkaca their plight 7. 148. 45; Pāñcālas, smiling, watched the battle between Karṇa and Ghaṭotkaca 7. 152. 5; Pāñcālas, oppressed excessively by Alāyudha, had no peace of mind (na śāntiṁ lebhire tatra… bhṛśapīḍitāḥ) 7. 152. 31; Karṇa forced the Pāñcāla mahārathas to run away; then they fought with Droṇa; they raised a loud roar when Alāyudha was killed by Ghaṭotkaca 7. 153. 8, 10, 33; Karṇa attacked Pāñcālas led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna and Śikhaṇḍin 7. 154. 3-4; Saṁjaya told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that every night Duryodhana asked Karṇa to kill next day Arjuna (or Kṛṣṇa) with his śakti so that the Pāñcālas could be ruled as if they were servants (preṣyavat pāṇḍupāñcālān upabhokṣyāmahe tataḥ)--Pāñcālas who were like the leaves of a tree in the form of the Pāṇḍavas (pāñcālāḥ patrasaṁjñitāḥ) 7. 157. 19-22; Dhṛtarāṣṭra was curious to know how the Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas who, armed and in battle-arrays (vyūḍhānīkāḥ prahāriṇaḥ) fought with Droṇa when they attacked him (7. 158. 13); when, Yudhiṣṭhira after the death of Ghaṭotkaca started to fight with Kauravas, Pāñcālas armed for battle (daṁśitāḥ) beat bheris and blew conches 7. 158. 50; Droṇa vowed that he would take off his armour only after he had killed Pāñcālas 7. 160. 12; towards the end of the night war, Droṇa divided his army into two parts and, led by Duryodhana, attacked Pāñcālas; they were specifically aflicted by the arrows of Droṇa; yet, although suffering from excessive pain, Pāñcālas continued to fight (pāñcālās tu viśeṣeṇa droṇasāyakapīḍitāḥ/samasajjanta rājendra samare bhṛśavedanāḥ) 7. 161. 3, 28; when Droṇa killed Virāṭa, Drupada, and other warriors of Pāñcālas, Dhṛṣṭadyumna cursed the Pāñcāla warriors who would let Droṇa remain alive or turn away from him; Pāñcālas then attacked Droṇa, but they could not even look at Droṇa although they tried, protected as he was by Duryodhana and others (yatamānāpi pāñcālā na śekuḥ parivīkṣitum) 7. 161. 35-37, 38, 40; (53) On the fifteenth day, when the large armies of Kauravas and Pāñcālas clashed with one another, everything was in turmoil and nothing was quite clear (āvignam abhavat sarvam…na prājñāyata kiṁcana); in the raised dust it was difficult to know who were Kauraveyas and who Pāñcālas 7. 162. 22, 27-28; during the duel between Karṇa and Bhīma, Yudhiṣṭhira addressed the chief heroes of Pāñcālas and urged them to go and help the chief warriors of Pāṇḍavas (pāñcālānāṁ naravyāghrān…tatra gacchata yatraite yudhyante māmakā rathāḥ); Pāñcālas, thus urged, divided their army into four parts (caturdhā vāhinīṁ kṛtvā): a part hit Droṇa with arrows; others, led by Bhīma, covered him from another side (pāñcālās tv ekato droṇam abhyaghnan bahubhiḥ śaraiḥ/bhīmasenapurogāś ca ekataḥ paryavārayan//); Arjuna was urged to separate Kurus from Droṇa; then Pāñcālas would kill Droṇa whose protectors were slain; but Droṇa attacked Pāñcālas and killed them; however, they continued to attack Droṇa; as they were getting killed a fearful sound was raised by them; when Pāñcālas were thus getting killed, Pāṇḍavas were afraid and they lost hope of victory (vadhyamāneṣu saṁgrāme pāñcāleṣu...pāṇḍavān bhayam āviśat/…nāśaṁsur vijayaṁ tadā//) 7. 164. 48-54, 56-58, 60-63; after the false news of Aśvatthāman's death twenty thousand Pāñcāla principal heroes (nararṣabhāḥ) showered arrows from all sides on Droṇa; he then used brahmāstra to kill Pāñcālas; with that missile he cut off their heads and large arms adorned with gold ornaments (tathaiva parighākārān bāhūn kanakabhūṣaṇān) and killed twenty thousand Pāñcāla chariot-fighters (viṁśatisāhasrān pāñcālānāṁ rathavrajān) 7. 164. 78-83; that day Kauravas, led by Droṇa, had started fighting only with Pāñcālas (pāñcālair eva kevalaiḥ), and when Droṇa released the brahmāstra, especially Pāñcālas were killed (pāñcālāś ca viśeṣataḥ/…vyanaśan); when their armies were thus thrashed, Pāñcālas, (though) angered, turned away from battle (amarṣavaśam āpannāḥ pāñcālā vimukhābhavan) 7. 165. 98, 100-101, 104; Droṇa killed hosts of chariot-fighters of Pāñcālas but was killed 8. 4. 5; (54) After the death of Droṇa, Aśvatthāman assured Duryodhana that he would try to kill Pāñcālas by all sorts of means, whether soft or harsh (sarvopāyāir…karmaṇā yena teneha mṛdunā dāruṇena vā); only after killing Pāñcālas he would have peace of mind; he would force Pāñcālas to run away by the use of Nārāyaṇāstra 7. 166. 28-29, 52; Sahadeva, in order to pacify Sātyaki, told him that the Pāṇḍavas had no allies other than Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis and Pāñcālas; similarly the Pāñcālas had no allies other than Pāṇḍavas and Vṛṣṇis 7. 169. 48, 50; when, after the death of Droṇa, Kauravas and Pāṇḍava-Pāñcālas became ready to fight, Aśvatthāman aimed his Nārāyaṇāstra against the Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas; Yudhiṣṭhira, afraid of the effects produced by the astra, asked Dhṛṣṭadyumna to run away with Pāñcāla army; he also remembered that Pāñcālas. led by Satyajit and making effort for his victory, were totally destroyed by Droṇa (pāñcālāḥ satyajinmukhāḥ/kurvāṇā majjaye yatnaṁ samūlā vinipātitāḥ) 7. 170. 10, 15, 26, 34; Duryodhana urged Aśvatthāman to use Nārāyaṇāstra again when Pāficālas, wishing victory, had steadied themselves (vyavasthitā hi pāñcālāḥ punar eva jayaiṣiṇaḥ); Aśvatthāman told him his inability to do that but he forced Pāñcālas to run away wounding them with arrows; when Aśvatthāman succeeded in killing many prominent (Pāñcāla) heroes on the side of Pāṇḍavas he blew his large conch with delight; hearing that all Pāñcālas, and even Bhīma, ran in all directions leaving Dhṛṣṭadyumna behind 7. 171. 25, 45, 67; (55) Saṁjaya, summarizing the events between the death of Droṇa and that of Karṇa, told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Duryodhana assured his army that they would be witnesses to the heroism of Karṇa and Aśvatthāman against the Pāñcālas; Karṇa killed and afflicted many Pāñcālas, but was ultimately killed by Arjuna 8. 2. 15, 18, 20; 8. 5. 30; Dhṛtarāṣṭra remembered that Karṇa had once before defeated Pāñcālas and made them pay tribute (ajaiṣīt…pāñcālāṁś ca…cakre balibhṛtaḥ purā) 8. 5. 18-20 (reference to Karṇa's conquests before the Vaiṣṇava sacrifice of Duryodhana 3. 241. 29, 32; 3. App. I. 24. 28-34); (56) On the sixteenth day, Duryodhana requested Karṇa to lead the Kaurava army because when Pāñcālas would see him they would run away; Pāṇḍavas together with Pāñcālas would be disheartened on seeing Karṇa ready to fight (pāṇḍavā gatacetasaḥ…pāñcālaiḥ saha); the bards urged Karṇa to kill Pāñcālas and bring victory to Kauravas; they also said that Pāñcālas would not be able to withstand Karṇa ready with his arms 8. 6. 30-31, 40, 42; Pāñcālas and others rushed at the Kaurava army; their chariot-fighters, elephant-riders and important foot-soldiers, delighted, danced and laughed making different sounds (nānāvidharavair hṛṣṭā nṛtyanti ca hasanti ca) 8. 8. 19-20; Karṇa put to death twenty Pāñcāla chariot-fighters along with their horses and charioteers and felled down their banners; he also killed many other Pāñcālas; then Pāñcāla princes (? pāñcālaputrāś ca) attacked Karṇa 8. 16. 16, 22-23; heroes from the east and south, skilled in elephant-warfare, showered arrows, tomaras and nārācas on Pāñcālas; Pāñcālas, with sharp weapons, surrounded the elephants and showered arrows on them; they covered Nakula to protect him from those who were fighting from elephants; Karṇa, after defeating Nakula, turned towards Pāñcālas; Pāṇḍavas raised a loud cry seeing Karṇa approach Pāñcāla chariot-fighters (dṛṣṭvā senāpatiṁ yāntaṁ pāñcālānāṁ rathavrajān 8. 17. 99); their chariots then were carried away (by horses) with or without the charioteers and their axles broken; those Pāñcāla mahārathas who survived began to run away; Karṇa, showering arrows, persecuted Pāñcālas whose armours and banners were broken and tormented them with arrows 8. 17. 7, 21, 98-99, 101, 119-120; Ulūka, after defeating Yuyutsu, turned towards Pāñcālas striking them with arrows 8. 18. 11; when Yudhiṣṭhira fought a duel with Duryodhana, Pāñcālas attacked Kauravas making sounds (kṣveḍāḥ kilakilāśābdāḥ) and striking thousands of tūryas; men fought against men, elephants against elephants, chariots against chariot-fighters and horses against horse-riders; those duels were for a while pleasing to watch (dvandvāny āsan mahārāja prekṣaṇīyāni saṁyuge; muhūrtam eva tad yuddham āsīn madhuradarśanam); all fought the battle according to the rules; nobody struck the opponent from behind (anyonyaṁ samare jaghnur yodhavratam anuṣṭhitāḥ/na hi te samaraṁ cakruḥ pṛṣthato vai kathaṁcana//) 8. 19. 45-49; but later the battle was fought disregarding the proper norms; the battle described in 8. 19. 49 ff.; Karṇa killed Pāñcālas 8. 19. 74; (57) On the seventeenth day, Duryodhana wanted Karṇa and Śalya together to kill Pāṇḍavas along with Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas 8. 23. 15; Karṇa asked Śalya to drive his chariot to Pāñcālas and others; either he would kill them or they would kill him; Śalya pointed out to Karṇa that the banners and the chariots of Pāñcālas were making sound (dhvajāḥ kaṇakaṇāyante…sapatākā rathāś cāpi pāñcālānām) 8. 31. 51; a fierce battle broke out between Pāñcālas and Kauravas; Duryodhana protected Karṇa fighting with Pāñcālas and other heroes; Karṇa rushed towards Dhṛṣṭadyumna and Pāñcālas who rushed at him; Karṇa killed twentyfive Pāñcāla warriors with equal number of arrows; hosts of Pāñcāla chariot-fighters then surrounded Karṇa; Karṇa killed with five arrows five Pāñcāla prominent warriors viz. Bhānudeva, Citrasena, Senābindu, Tapana and Śūrasena; then there was a loud cry of anger among the Pāñcālas (hāhākāro mahān āsīt pāñcālānāṁ mahāhave); but Pāñcālas, equipped (daṁśitāḥ), attacked Karṇa 8. 32. 15, 20, 25-26, 33, 35-38, 43; they checked the advance of Karṇa; he could not break through their resistance to reach Yudhiṣṭhira; when he reached Yudhiṣṭhira and defeated him the latter turned back and Pāñcālas followed him 8. 33. 7, 9, 15, 41; Pāñcālas and others gathered together and, disregarding the terrible fear of death (tyaktvā mṛtyubhayaṁ ghoram), attacked Aśvatthāman 8. 39. 10; Karṇa killed Pāñcālas by thousands 8. 40. 4-5; when he attacked them, no one of them turned back; they attacked Karṇa from all sides; he moved among them unafraid; he made hosts of their chariot-fighters run away 8. 40. 42, 44, 58-59; Karṇa, singlehanded, announcing his name (viśrāvya nāma) killed many Pāñcālas, respected by brave (śūrasaṁmatāḥ); onlookers like Saṁjaya felt that no Pāñcāla warrior would be allowed to live by Karṇa; Karṇa, while blowing away Pāñcālas (vidhaman), rushed towards Yudhiṣṭhira; he, alone, fought with Cedis, Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas 8. 40. 62-64, 68; Pāñcālas, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, followed Bhīma and returned to battle (tam ete 'nu nivartante) 8. 41. 3; Karṇa, alone, held back Pāñcālas and others; when Pāñcālas saw that Dhṛṣṭadyumna was saved by Arjuna, they, considering themselves victorious, sounded musical instruments by thousands and made loud roar 8. 42. 32, 54-55; Pāñcālas quickly rallied round Yudhiṣṭhira to help him; in the presence of Pāñcālas and others, Karṇa broke the banner on the chariot of Yudhiṣṭhira; he destroyed the army of Pāṇḍavas (including Pāñcālas); Pāñcālas started to run away; Karṇa had already defeated them; it was felt that Karṇa attacking them would extirpate Pāñcālas (samucchetsyati); but when Bhīma appeared, Pāñcālas started killing Kaurava army 8. 43. 3, 22-29, 31-32, 50, 53; chariotfighters (rathinaḥ) of Kauravas, struck by Pāñcālas, fell down from their chariots; Pāñcālas returned towards the army of Kauravas (dhārtarāṣṭrān) and killed those who, riding elephants, horses and chariots, were fighting; supported by Bhīma, Pāñcālas disregarded their lives and crushed their enemies; while killing their adversaries, they blew conches and shouted; when the Pāñcālas were thus killing the Kaurava army, Kṛpa, Karṇa and other heroes made great attempt to stop their attack 8. 43. 59-65; but Pāñcālas, enraged and feeling victorious, attacked the Kaurava army from all sides 8. 44. 8; Karṇa assured Śalya that he would kill all Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas and then released his Bhārgavāstra against them; Pāñcālas, afflicted by that missile, raised a loud cry (hāhākāro mahān āsīt pāñcālānām…); getting killed by the missile Pāñcālas were all confused (tatra tatra vyamuhyanta) 8. 45. 32, 37, 41; Karṇa cut off the banner of Yudhiṣṭhira and killed his two side-charioteers in the presence of Pāñcālas (hatau ca pārṣṇisārathī) 8. 46. 12; Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna: all Pāñcālas, under Arjuna's guidance, were ready to fight; protected by him, they had killed enemies; Bhīṣma had earlier killed Pāñcālas; Arjuna now should kill the enemies, viz. the five great warriors Aśvatthāman, Kṛtavarman, Karṇa, Śalya and Kṛpa, so that Pāñcālas might rejoice (adya modantu pāñcālā…); Pāñcālas wished to rescue Pāṇḍavas (pāṇḍavān ujjihīrṣavaḥ) but were fleeing as they got killed by Karṇa; they were as good as under the control of Karṇa (viddhi karṇavaśaṁ gatān); Pāñcālas, struck by Karṇa, raised a fierce cry (śrūyate ninado ghoras…); when they faced Bhīṣma, they never turned back (nāsan parāṅmukhāḥ); they would not turn back due to fear of Karṇa; Karṇa was killing the attacking Pāñcālas by hundreds -- Pāñcālas who gave lives for their friends; Pāñcālas were fleeing in all directions (ete caranti pāñcālā dikṣu sarvāsu) as they faced the irresistible astra of Karṇa obtained by him from Bhārgava (8. 51. 101); if Karṇa was neglected (upekṣitaḥ karṇo…); he would kill Pāñcālas and the rest 8. 51. 5-6, 12, 27, 54, 91-96, 98-100, 104, 106; Arjuna saw Pāñcāla army running away; he desired to pay back the debt he owed to Pāñcālas by killing Karṇa (pāñcālānāṁ ca mādhava/ adyānṛṇyaṁ gamiṣyāmi) 8. 52. 5, 28; as desired by Karṇa, Śalya drove his chariot towards Pāñcālas; entering their army, Śalya stopped Karṇa's chariot wherever he desired; seeing Karṇa's chariot, the Pāñcālas trembled (trastā āsan); when Karṇa killed Pāñcālas a loud cry arose among them (tatrākrando mahān āsīt); although the great Pāñcāla archers were defeated, they returned to fight till death (mṛtyuṁ kṛtvā nivartanam); Karṇa killed twentyfive chariot-fighters and more than hundred horse-riders; the wonderful heroism of Pāñcālas was witnessed by others when Pāñcālas did not abandon fighting although they were getting killed (tatrādbhutam apaśyāma pāñcālānāṁ parākramam/vadhyamānāpi karṇena nājahū raṇamūrdhani//); two sons (not named) of Karṇa killed strong Pāñcālas 8. 56. 8-11, 23, 31, 47, 49, 54, 56; but at one stage Pāñcālas, afraid of Karṇa, began to flee (ete dravanti pāñcālāḥ karṇāt trastā…) 8. 57. 3; Karṇa rushed towards Pāñcālas in spite of Arjuna (paśyataḥ savyasācinaḥ); he killed Pāñcālas by releasing thousands of arrows; there was fierce battle of Karṇa with Pāñcālas who were getting killed while fighting for the sake of their allies (vadhyatāṁ sūtaputreṇa mitrārthe 'mitraghātināṁ) 8. 59. 42, 44-45; Karṇa scattered away Pāñcāla princes (? pāñcālaputrān); Karṇa was making the Pāṇḍava army devoid of Pāñcālas (apāñcālyaṁ kriyate); then five senior Pāñcāla chariot-fighters, Uttamaujas and others, attacked Karṇa but were not able to fell down Karṇa from his chariot; all of them were hit by Karṇa with arrows after he cut off their bows and banners and killed their horses and chariots; all of them were defeated by Karṇa; when they were rescued by Draupadī's sons and Sātyaki, the five chariot-fighters got other chariots and, wellarmed, they rallied round Sātyaki to protect him 8. 60. 1, 10, 15-17, 21-22, 26; Karṇa tormented Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas by the lustre of his missiles (pratāpya …astratejasā), but was thoroughly pacified by the lustre of Arjuna (i. e. by his missiles) (saṁśāntaḥ pārthatejasā) 8. 68. 43; Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas honoured Arjuna when Karṇa was killed 8. 69. 37; (58) In the evening of the seventeenth day Duryodhana told Śalya that when he would be on the battle-field Pāñcālas would give up all effort (nirudyamāḥ) 9. 5. 24; Śalya, when chosen by Duryodhana to lead his army, assured him that he would kill all Pāñcālas in battle: “let them see in battle my heroism, strength of my arms and bow, my skill and power of my missiles” (vikramaṁ mama paśyantu dhanuṣaś ca mahad balam/lāghavaṁ cāstravīryaṁ ca bhujayoś ca balaṁ yudhi//) 9. 6. 11, 13-14; after listening to Kṛṣṇa's advice, Yudhiṣṭhira permitted all Pāñcālas to leave and he slept that night freed of all care; all Pāñcālas too, delighted at Karṇa's death, slept (happily) that night 9. 6. 38-40; (59) On the eighteenth day, the victorious Pāñcālas went to the battlefield 9. 7. 42; seeing Śalya's heroism, Duryodhana felt Pāñcālas, Sṛṁjayas and Pāṇḍavas as good as dead 9. 12. 28; having heard Yudhiṣṭhira's vow to kill Śalya, all Pāñcālas felt delighted; they blew conches, beat bheris and puṣkaras by hundreds and made loud roar in anticipation of the fulfilment of the vow (tataḥ praharṣaḥ…punar āsīt…pāñcālānāṁ…pratijñām tāṁ ca saṁgrāme dharmarājasya pūrayan) 9. 15. 2728; Pāñcālas and others, angered by Śalya's killing their army, surrounded him 9. 16. 6; when the Madra army, incited by Duryodhana, entered the Pāṇḍava army, Pāñcālas and others surrounded Yudhiṣṭhira wishing his sefety (yudhiṣṭhiraṁ parīpsantaḥ); Madra warriors shouted: “where are the great warriors of Pāñcālas (pāñcālānāṁ mahāvīryāḥ) 9. 17. 8, 13; when the Kaurava army fled after the death of Śalya, Pāñcālas, desirous of victory, persecuted them; seeing the Kaurava army, oppressed by fear, running away, Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas spoke to each other about the victory of Yudhiṣṭhira and the defeat of Duryodhana 9. 18. 11, 13-14; seeing Śālva's heroism, Pāñcālas raised cries of despair (hāhākārair nādayantaḥ) and surrounded his elephant 9. 19. 21; hearing the loud roar of delighted Kauravas (siṁhanādaḥ prahṛṣṭānāṁ…), Pāñcālas were dejected; when Kṛtavarman and Sātyaki were engaged in a duel, Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas acted as spectators (prekṣakāḥ samapadyanta); when Kaurava army started running away at the defeat of Kṛtavarman, Duryodhana attacked Pāñcālas and halted them with arrows 9. 20. 6-7, 11, 33-34; Pāṇḍavas, helped by Pāñcālas, stopped the advance of Kurus and killed their seven hundred chariot-fighters; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Sahadeva to kill Śakuni; he himself, along with Pāñcālas, would guard the division of chariots (rathānīkam ahaṁ rakṣye) 9. 22. 14, 34; (60) Aśvatthāman left the army of Pāñcāla king (pāñcālarājasya tad anīkam, i. e. Pāñcālas) and went to Śakuni 9. 24. 42; (61) Aśvatthāman assured Duryodhana, who had hid himself in water, that he would that very day kill all Pāñcālas, or else he would not remove his armour; on learning the whereabouts of Duryodhana, when Pāṇḍavas started towards the lake, the delighted Pāñcālas raised a loud roar (kilakilāśabdaḥ prādurāsīd…); those Pāñcālas who survived the war of eighteen days followed Pāṇḍavas to the lake (pāñcālānāṁ ca ye śiṣṭāḥ) 9. 29. 21, 46, 52: Duryodhana even in that condition wished to destroy the enthusiasm of Pāñcālas 9. 30. 43; Duryodhana was not afraid of either Pāṇḍavas or Pāñcālas; with mace in his hand he was confident to defeat them in battle; equipped with mace, he appeared to Pāñcālas like Indra with his vajra or Śiva with his śūla; Pāñcālas and other Pāṇḍava warriors clapped each other's palms (anyonyasya talān daduḥ); Duryodhana considered that to be his insult; angered, he said that he would send Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas to the abode of Yama 9. 31. 13, 30, 40-44; Pāñcālas welcomed the decision of Bhīma to fight with Duryodhana and kill him (tad vaco bhīmasenasya sarva evābhyapūjayan) 9. 32. 27; hearing Duryodhana's challenging words, they also applauded him (saṁpūjayām āsus tad vacaḥ) 9. 32. 50; seeing the bad omens which occurred at the time of the downfall of Duryodhana, Pāñcālas were dejected (āvignamanasaḥ) 9. 57. 57; they were not very happy when Balarāma, displeased with the way Duryodhana was made to lie low, left for Dvārakā (nātipramanaso 'bhavan) 9. 59. 27; when Duryodhana fell down, Pāñcālas, delighted (prahṛṣṭamanasaḥ), threw up their upper garments and made roaring sounds; some expressed their joy by stretching their bows, others by sounding bow-strings; some blew big conches and still others beat dundubhis; some made sportive gestures and laughed (cikrīḍuś ca tathaivānye jaharṣuś ca); they said many things in praise of Bhīmasena 9. 60. 3-16; hearing that, Kṛṣṇa rebuked them 9. 60. 17-18; hearing Kṛṣṇa's words reassuring Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas for the means they adopted to defeat Kauravas, Pāñcālas were very much delighted; they roared like herds of lions (bhṛśasaṁhṛṣṭā vineduḥ siṁhasaṁghavat); Aśvatthāman assured Duryodhana that he would kill all Pāñcālas with all sorts of means in the very presence of Kṛṣṇa (sarvopāyair hi neṣyāmi pretarājaniveśanam) 9. 64. 35; (a reference to this incident in 1. 2. 180); (62) References to what happened during the night of the eighteenth day are found at the beginning of the Śalyaparvan: (i) Vaiśaṁpāyana told Janamejaya that during that night the three heroes on the side of Kauravas who survived the war (hataśiṣṭās trayo rathāḥ) killed the entire Pāñcāla army; that was told by Saṁjaya to Dhṛtarāṣṭra 9. 1. 13, 30; (ii) Dhṛtarāṣṭra remembered that Duryodhana had assured him that he would kill all Pāñcālas; he then asked Saṁjaya to tell him how all Pāñcālas, together with foot-soldiers, were killed (pāñcālāś ca yathā sarve nihatāḥ sapadānugāḥ) 9. 2. 22, 63; (63) In the night of the eighteenth day Aśvatthāman resolved to kill Pāñcālas when they were asleep; he told Kṛpa that Pāñcālas, tired due to exertion, would sleep that night delightfully, trustfully, feeling themselves victorious, unyoking their horses and keeping away their armours; he would storm Pāñcālas in their camp to kill them with his sword and then get peace of mind; he would repay the debt he owed to his father by killing Pāñcālas; by killing the Pāñcāla army at night he will have done his duty and feel happy 10. 1. 53; 10. 3. 25, 28-32, 3435; earlier when Bhīma had stepped on Duryodhana's head, Pāñcālas growled, laughted, blew conches and sounded dundubhis 10. 1. 58-59; Kṛpa told Aśvatthāman that they should kill Pāñcālas next day in battle; Aśvatthāman was quite capable of defeating the Pāñcāla army while fighting with them; they would return from the battle-field only after killing the wretched Pāñcālas or get themselves killed 10. 4. 4, 15, 18; but Aśvatthāman was unable to live even for a while since he had heard Pāñcālas saying: “Droṇa was killed”; they deserved to be killed by him 10. 4. 25-26; Kṛpa tried to dissuade Aśvatthāman by telling him that it would not be proper to kill Pāñcālas when they were trustfully asleep 10. 5. 11; but Aśvatthāman asked Kṛpa why he did not blame Pāñcālas who had committed sin by not following dharma and broken all norms of life (evam adhārmikāḥ pāpāḥ pāñcālā bhinnasetavaḥ); he had therefore decided to kill them during their sleep 10. 5. 2425; Mahādeva told Aśvatthāman that he formerly protected Pāñcālas only out of regard for Kṛṣṇa; but now they were overpowered by Kāla and did not deserve to live (abhibhūtās tu kālena naiṣām adyāsti jīvitam) 10. 7. 63; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṁjaya whether Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman did what was expected of them or whether they were killed by Pāñcālas 10. 8. 4; when Aśvatthāman came out of the camp, Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman told him that they had killed Pāñcālas (when they tried to escape) by thousands; Aśvatthāman told them that he had killed the rest of the Pāñcālas in the camp 10. 8. 141, 150; after killing all Pāñcālas, the three of them went to Duryodhana; they told him that all Pāñcālas were killed by them 10. 9. 1, 9, 49; the killing of Pāñcālas referred to earlier by Dhṛtarāṣṭra as a disgusting and disgraceful act of Aśvatthāman and others 1. 1. 153; 1. 2. 181; Kṛṣṇa consoled Yudhiṣṭhira by telling him that Pāñcālas and their companions (pāñcālāś ca sahānugāḥ) were killed by Mahādeva (and not by Aśvatthāman) 10. 18. 26; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra was on his way to the battlefield, Aśvatthāman and others told him and Gāndhārī that they had killed Pāñcālas and others 11. 10. 12; (64) When Yudhiṣṭhira started to meet Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāñcāla women present there, followed him (saha pāñcālayoṣidbhir yās tatrāsan samāgatāḥ) 11. 11. 4; (65) When Pāñcāla and Kuru women saw their husbands and relatives lying dead on the battlefield they fell down from their chariots; tired and helpless they were almost deprived of their consciousness (śrāntānāṁ cāpy anāthānāṁ nāsīt kācana cetanā) 11. 16. 13-15; Gāndhārī told Kṛṣṇa that looking at the destruction of Kurus and Pāñcālas, she burnt with grief 11. 16. 25; she asked him how was young Abhimanyu killed by many in the presence of Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas 11. 20. 18; (66) Yudhiṣṭhira told Kuntī that he was much more grieved to learn the truth about Karṇa's birth than by the death of Pāñcālas and others (tataḥ śataguṇaṁ duḥkham) 11. 27. 18-19; (67) Yudhiṣṭhira, repenting after the war, said that Pāñcālas and Kurus were no doubt killed; but those of them who were not killed would, after death, go to the lowest regions on account of their (i. e. of both Pāñcālas and Kurus) acts 12. 7. 20; Yudhiṣṭhira while taking leave of Kuntī said that Pāñcālas (i. e. their males) were very much depleted, only their daughters remained (pañcālāḥ subhṛśaṁ kṣīṇāḥ kanyāmātrāvaśeṣitāḥ); he did not know who would establish their line again, since most of them were reduced to ashes by Droṇa and those who survived were killed by Aśvatthāman at night 15. 44. 32-33. 

  D.   Past event: Formerly, the ṛṣis of the Naimiṣa forest after completing the Viśvajit sacrifice went to the Pāñcāla country (purā…viśvajito 'nte vai pāñcālān ṛṣayo 'gaman) 9. 40. 3.

  B.   Considered favourable for marching out of the army or for going out on a pilgrimage: (1) Duryodhana urged again and again the assembled kings to march towards Kurukṣetra on that very day since it was presided over by the Puṣya nakṣatra (ājñāpayac ca rājñas tān pārthivān duṣṭacetasaḥ/prayādhvaṁ vai kurukṣetraṁ puṣyo 'dyeti punaḥ punaḥ) 5. 148. 3 (Nī. on Bom.

Ed. Vol. 11, p. 489); 9. 34. 14; (5) Drupada asked his Purohita, whom he sent as his messenger to the Kauravas, to start when the moon was in conjunction with the Puṣya so that he might achieve the objective of Yudhiṣṭhira (sa bhavān puṣyayogena…kauraveyān prayātv āśu kaunteyasyārthasiddhaye) 5. 6. 17; (6) Daśaratha asked his Purohita to make the necessary preparations in connection with the consecration of Rāma as hairapparent since on that night Puṣya was to enter into the auspicious conjunction (with the moon) (adya puṣyo niśi brahman puṇyaṁ yogam upaiṣyati) 3. 261. 15. 

  C.   Advent of the Kṛta Yuga: When the moon, the sun, the Tiṣya and the Bṛhaspati will come in one rāśi, the Kṛta Yuga will commence (yadā candraś ca sūryaś ca tathā tiṣyabṛhaspatī/ekarāśau sameṣyanti prapatsyati tadā kṛtam//) 3. 188. 87 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 3. 190. 90: gurusūryacandrāḥ yadā yugapat puṣyanakṣatram eṣyanti tadā kṛtayugapravṛttir ity arthaḥ). 

  D.   Religious rites: (1) Gifts under this nakṣatra: Nārada told Devakī (13. 63. 2-4) that by giving gold, whether wrought or unwrought, as gift under Puṣya (puṣye) one shone like Soma (i. e. moon ?) in the worlds which have no (other) light (anālokeṣu lokeṣu somavat sa virājate) 13. 63. 10 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 64. 10: anālokeṣu ālokāntaravarjiteṣu svayaṁprakāśeṣv ity arthaḥ); (2) śrāddha: Yama told Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that one who desired prosperity should think of offering a kāmya śrāddha under the Puṣya nakṣatra (puṣṭikāmo 'tha puṣyeṇa śrāddham īheta mānavaḥ) 13. 89. 4. 

  E.   Bad omen: Among the bad omens for the Kauravas, pointed out by Vyāsa to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, one was related to a fierce comet (Rāhu ?) that had taken hold of Puṣya (dhūmaketur mahāghoraḥ puṣyam ākramya tiṣṭhati) 6. 3. 12. [See  Dhūmaketu, Pauṣya ]

  C.   Author: The great epic composed by the great sage Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana, also called Vyāsa, the son of Satyavatī 1. 1. 9-10 (kṛṣṇadvaipāyanaproktāḥ…kathāḥ… mahābhāratasaṁśritāḥ); 1. 1. 15 (dvaipāyanena yat proktaṁ purāṇam); 1. 1. 19 (vyāsasyādbhutakarmaṇaḥ/saṁhitām); 1. 1. 52 (itihāsam imaṁ cakre puṇyaṁ satyavatīsutaḥ); 1. 1. 56 (mahān ṛṣiḥ not named); 1. 1. 60 (bhagavān ṛṣiḥ not named); came out of the lips of Dvaipāyana (dvaipāyanoṣṭhapuṭaniḥsṛtam) 1. 2. 242 18. 5. 54; 1. 53. 28 (vyāsasaṁpannām); 1. 53. 35 (kṛṣṇadvaipāyanamatam); 1. 56. 12 (mataṁ kṛtsnaṁ vyāsasya); 1. 56. 13 (satyavatyātmajeneha vyākhyātam 1. 56. 15 (purāṇam ṛṣisaṁstutam sage not named); 1. 56. 21 (proktaṁ vyāsena); 1. 56. 25 (kṛṣṇadvaipāyanenedaṁ kṛtam); fully engrossed, the sage composed it in three years (tribhir varsaiḥ sadotthāyī kṛṣṇadvaipāyano muniḥ/mahābhāratam ākhyānaṁ kṛtavān) 1. 56. 32, 18. 5. 41; 12. 334. 9 (kṛṣṇadvaipāyanaṁ vyāsaṁ viddhi nārāyaṇaṁ prabhum/ko hy anyaḥ puruṣavyāghra mahābhāratkṛd bhavet); having composed it at the foot of the mountain Himavant the sage (not named) was tired by the strenuous activity (? tapaḥ) of composing the ākhyāna (himavatpāda āsataḥ//kṛtvā bhāratam ākhyānaṁ tapaḥśrāntasya dhīmataḥ) 12. 337. 9-10; 18. 5. 31 (kṛṣṇena muninā); 18. 5. 46 (maharṣir bhagavān vyāsaḥ kṛtvemāṁ saṁhitāṁ purā); the sage Kṛṣṇa (Vyāsa) who is described as gitfed with divine sight (divyacakṣuḥ 18. 5. 7) and supersensory power (kṛṣṇena…atīndriyeṇa 18. 5. 31-32) composed it having seen it with his divine eye (dṛṣṭvā divyena cakṣuṣā) 18. 5. 33; Vyāsa had assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that he would proclaim the fame of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas 6. 2. 13; the sage is also credited to have made the Parvasaṁgraha listing a hundred sub-parvans of the Bhārata (etat parvaśataṁ pūrṇaṁ vyāsenoktaṁ mahātmanā) 1. 2. 70. 

  D.   Etymology: So called because of its extent (? importance ?) and weight (mahattvād bhāravattvāc ca mahābhāratam ucyate/niruktam asya yo veda) 1. 1. 209; so called because it contains the great life-story (?) of the Bhāratas (bhāratānāṁ mahaj janma mahābhāratam ucyate/niruktam asya yo veda) 1. 56. 31. 

  E.   Extent: One hundred thousand ślokas 1. 56. 13 (idaṁ śatasahasraṁ hi ślokānāṁ puṇyakarmaṇām); 12. 331. 2 (idaṁ śatasahasrād dhi bhāratākhyānavistarāt). 

  F.   Abridgements: Its abridgements are referred to in 1. 1. 25 (vistaraiś ca samāsaiś ca dhāryate yad dvijātibhiḥ); the sage himself is credited with an abridgement of the store of knowledge after he had first expounded it in full; learned men desire to preserve it in full as well as in abridgement (vistīryaitan mahaj jñānam ṛṣiḥ saṁkṣepam abravīt/iṣtaṁ hi vidusāṁ loke samāsavyāsadhāranam) 1. 1. 49; the sage Dvaipāyana abridged (the full extent of one hundred thousand ślokas into 24000 ślokas by omitting the upākhyānas- this is known as Bhārata (caturviṁśatisāhasrīṁ cakre bhāratasaṁhitām/upākhyānair vinā tāvad bhārataṁ procyate budhaiḥ) 1. 1. 61; it was further abridged into 150 ślokas in the form of a table of contents of all the incidents of the sub-parvans (this could refer to 1. 2. 71-233) (tato 'dhyardhaśataṃ bhūyaḥ saṁkṣepaṁ kṛtavān ṛṣiḥ/anukramaṇim adhyāyaṁ vṛttāntānāṁ saparvaṇām 1. 1. 62; etad akhilam ākhyātaṁ bhārataṁ parvasaṁgrahāt 1. 2. 234); the list of the hundred sub-parvans of the Bhārata (1. 2. 34-1. 2. 70) is included in its abridgement (samāso bhāratasyāyaṁ tatroktaḥ parvasaṁgrahaḥ) 1. 2. 71; before narrating in all details, the Mahābhārata was first summarized by Vaiśampāyana for Janamejaya (kathitaṁ vai samāsena tvayā sarvaṁ dvijottama/ mahābhārataṁ ākhyānam) 1. 56. 1; this summary began with the return of the Pāṇḍavas to Hāstinapura after the death of Pāṇḍu and it ended with the death of Duryodhana and the Pāṇḍavas obtaining the kingdom 1. 55. 6-42; a sort of a summary which began with Pāṇḍu's conquering many countries and then retiring to the forest and ended with the great destruction after the war leaving only ten heroes alive is made by Sūta Ugraśravas for the sages assembled in the Naimiṣa forest 1. 1. 67-158. 

  G.   Three beginnings: According to Sūta Ugraśravas there were three different views regrding the beginning of the Bhārata: (1) according to one view it began with Manu Vaivasvata (manvādi bhārataṁ kecit) 1. 1. 50 (i. e. with prajāpates tu dakṣasya manor vaivasvatasya ca/…anvaye//yādavānām imaṁ vaṁśaṁ pauravāṇāṁ ca sarvaśaḥ/tathaiva bhāratānāṁ ca (?) 1. 70. 1-2); Devabodha on 1. 1. 50 explains manuḥ as ādirājaḥ; according to Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 1. 52, in the opinion of the easterners, manu means mantra and hence manvādi refers to the maṅgala stanza nārāyaṇaṁ namaskṛtya etc. or om namo bhagavate etc. found at the beginning of the epic in some manuscripts; in his own opinion, however, manu refers to Manu Vaivasvata, the son of the heaven, cf. manur mantraḥ nārāyaṇaṁ namaskṛtyeti/ om namo bhagavate vāsudevāyeti vā tadādi iti prañcaḥ/divaḥ putro vaivasvatamahyasaṁjño manus tadādīti tattvam/); (2) according to another view the Bhārata begins with āstīka (āstīkādi tathāpare) 1. 1. 50 (i. e. with the adhyāya 1. 13 beginning of the Āstīkaparvan); (3) according to a third view it begins with uparicara (tathoparicarād anye) 1. 1. 50 (i. e. with rājoparicaro nāma 1. 57. 1).

Its first teaching and subsequent narrations: (1) Teaching: Dvaipāyana (Vyāsa) first taught it to his son Śuka and then handed it over to his other deserving pupils 1. 1. 63; he taught it to Śuka together with the four ślokas (18. 5. 47-50) known as the Bhāratasāvitrī 18. 5. 51; Vyāsa taught the Mahabhārata to his pupils Sumantu, Jaimini, Paila, Vaiśaṁpāyana and to his son Śuka 1. 57. 74-75; Vyāsa taught it to them on the mount Meru 12. 327. 16-18; on the slope of the Himavant mountain (himavatpāde) 12. 337. 9, 12, 14-15 (vedārthān bhāratārthāṁś ca …vyāhartum upacakrame); (2) Narrations: (i) Nārada recited it for the gods, Asita Devala for the manes (pitṛn), and Śuka for the Gandharvas, the Yaksas and the demons 1. 1. 64; 18. 5. 42; (ii) The pupils of Vyāsa made separate public recitations of the Bhārata saṁhitā received by them from him (saṁhitās taiḥ pṛthaktvena bhāratasya prakāśitāḥ) 1. 57. 75; (iii) one such recitation by his pupil Vaiśaṁpāyana is recorded in the epic: When Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana arrived at the snake-sacrifice of Janamejaya he was requested by the king to narrate to him the life-story of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas (1. 54. 18 ff.); Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana then asked his pupil Vaiśaṁpāyana to narrate it as the latter had heard it from him; Vaiśaṁpāyana then narrated the whole purātana itihāsa to the king, and to those who had assembled in the sadas, and to all other Kṣatriyas (tasmai rājñe sadasyebhyaḥ kṣatriyebhyaś ca sarvaśaḥ) 1. 54. 21-24; 1. 1. 8-10; 1. 1. 18; 1. 1. 57-58; 1. 55. 2-3; 1. 55. 4-43 (summary); 18. 5. 26, 30, 42; 18. 1. 2; (iv) but in one place the ākhyāna is said to have been narrated by Vyāsa himself to Janamejaya continuously (vyāsas tv akathayan nityam ākhyānaṁ bhārataṁ mahat) 1. 53 31; he narrated it in intervals (mahābhāratam ākhyānaṁ…janamejayena yat pṛṣṭaḥ kṛṣṇadvaipāyanas tadā//śrāvayām āsa vidhivat tadā karmāntareṣu saḥ/) 1. 53. 32-33; (v) it was further narrated by Sūta Ugraśravas, son of Lomaharṣaṇa, to Śaunaka and the other sages assembled in the Naimiṣa forest for the twelve-yearly sacrificial session of Śaunaka as the Sūta had heard the composition of Vyāsa being told by Vaiśaṁpāyana to Janamejaya in the latter's snake sacrifice 1. 1. 8-10, 23; 1. 4. 1; 1. 2. 74; 1. 1. 67-158 (summary); 1. 2. 29; Ugraśravas recounted the Parvasaṁgraha (1. 2. 34-69) made by Vyāsa as also the eighteen major parvans (etat parvaśataṁ pūrṇaṁ vyāsenoktaṁ mahātmanā/yathāvat sūtaputreṇa lomaharṣaṇinā punaḥ//kathitaṁ naimiṣāraṇye parvāṇy aṣṭādaśaiva tu) 1. 2. 70-71; the Sūta also narrated the summary of the eighteen major parvans (based on the hundred sub-parvans) together with the number of the adhyāyas and the ślokas in each parvan 1. 2. 72-234; 1. 53. 2736; 18. 5. 30. 

  I.   Purpose: To spread the fame of the Pāṇḍavas in the world (pāṇḍavānāṁ yaśaskaram) 1. 53. 32; of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas 6. 2. 13; and also of the other Kṣatriyas possessing ample wealth and lustre (kīrtim prathayatā loke pāṇḍavānāṁ mahātmanām/anyeṣāṁ kṣatriyāṇāṁ ca bhūridraviṇatejasām) 18. 5. 34.

  K.   Importance: In this epic Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana has expounded a holy upaniṣad (atropaniṣadaṁ puṇyāṁ kṛṣṇadvaipāyano 'bravīt) 1. 1. 191; truth and nectar constitute the body of the Bhārata (as the butter of curds and the Brāhmaṇa of the bipeds) bhāratasya vapur hy etat satyaṁ cāmṛtam eva ca) 1. 1. 201 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 1. 264: satyaṁ brahma amṛtaṁ devabhāvaś ca atraivāstīty arthaḥ); as ocean is the best of the reservoirs of water, a cow of the quadrupeds, so is the Bhārata (among the literary works) 1. 1. 201-202; one should expand this Veda (of Kṛṣṇa) with the help of the Itihāsa and Purāṇa for, with the thought: “he may (easily) go over me” the Veda is afraid of one who has not studied much (itihāsapurāṇābhyāṁ vedaṁ samupabṛṁhayet/bibhety alpaśrutād vedo mām ayaṁ pratariṣyati) 1. 1. 204 (Devabodha: upabṛṁhaṇam arthāntarakalpanayā kṣīṇasya yathāvad vyākhyānena paripoṣaḥ; Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 1. 1. 268: “yad dha tyaṁ māyinaṁ mṛgam tam u tyaṁ māyayāvadhīr” (ṚV. 1. 80. 7) iti mantrāvayavo hi rāmāyaṇīyamārīcavadhajñenaivopabṛṁhituṁ śakyo na tv anyenātas tasmādalpaśrutād vedasya bhayam ucitam eva/ vedārthajijñāsunā idam avaśyam adhyetavyam ity arthaḥ); when the sages once weighed the Bhārata in a balance against the four Vedas put together it outweighed them in largeness and heaviness (mahattve ca gurutve ca dhriyamāṇaṁ tato 'dhikam) 1. 1. 208 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 1. 273: mahattve granthata ādhikye gurutve arthata ādhikye); best among the works which deserve to be heard (when recited) (śrāvyāṇām uttamaṁ cedaṁ) 1. 56. 15; having heard this Purāṇa, composed by the great sage Dvaipāyana, it was honoured (abhipūjitam) by gods and Brahmarṣis 1. 1. 15; here are glorified holy divine sages (devarṣayaḥ puṇyāḥ), brahmanical and royal sages of auspicious deeds (puṇyā brahmarājarṣayas tathā/kīrtyante śubhakarmāṇaḥ), the Yakṣas and the great snakes, as also lord Vāsudeva 1. 1. 192-193; in this Purāṇa are expounded fully the two Puruṣārthas artha and dharma (asminn arthaś ca dharmaś ca nikhilenopadiśyate) 1. 56. 16; in respect of all the four Puruṣārthas viz. dharma, artha, kāma and mokṣa, whatever is here will be found elsewhere, what is not here cannot be found anywhere (dharme cārthe ca kāme ca mokṣe ca bharatarṣabha/ yad ihāsti tad anyatra yan nehāsti na tat kvacit/) 1. 56. 33 = 18. 5. 38; in this highly sacred Itihāsa one finds the exposition leading to emancipation (buddhiś ca parinaiṣṭhikī) 1. 56. 16; (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 62. 17: pariniṣṭhā mokṣas taducitā); this is a text on profit (arthaśāstram), a holy treatise on law (puṇyaṁ dharmaśāstram), a way to liberation (mokṣaśāstra) as expounded by Vyāsa 1. 56. 21; this is a great store of knowledge of the three worlds which is committed to memory by the twice-born fully and in abridgements (idaṁ tu triṣu lokeṣu mahaj jñānaṁ pratiṣṭhitam/vistaraiś ca samāsaiś ca dhāryate yad dvijātibhiḥ) 1. 1. 25; 1. 1. 49; storehouse of choice objects (ratnanidhi) 1. 56. 27 = 18. 5. 52; the unsurpassed ocean of knowledge-having churned it with his intellect Vaiśaṁpāyana collected the ākhyāna based on the Nārāyaṇakathā (idaṁ (i. e. ākhyānaṁ) …āmathya dadhimanthena jñānodadhim anuttamam/ navanītaṁ yathā dadhno…samuddhṛtaṁ… nārāyaṇakathāśrayam) 12. 331. 1-4; some poets have narrated this itihāsa (composed by Vyāsa) before (Sūta Ugraśravas did it), some of the contemporaries of Ugraśravas were narrating it in his times, and others will narrate it in future (ācakhyuḥ kavayaḥ kecit saṁpraty ācakṣate pare/ ākhyāsyanti tathaivānye itihāsam imam bhuvi) 1. 1. 24; 1. 56. 22; even if one knew the four Vedas together with their aṅgas and the Upaniṣads, but did not know this ākhyāna, he could not be called learned (vicakṣaṇa) 1. 2. 235; having once listened to this ākhyāna one does not like to listen to any other composition although worth hearing 1. 2. 236; the intellects of the poets take their start from this excellent itihāsa (itihāsottamād asmāj jāyante kavibuddhayaḥ) 1. 2. 237; there is no narrative on this earth which does not have its basis in this ākhyāna (anāśrityaitad ākhyānaṁ kathā bhuvi na vidyate) 1. 2. 240; all great poets live on this ākhyāna (idaṁ sarvaiḥ kavivarair ākhyānam upajīvyate) 1. 2. 241; the whole Purāṇa is included in the scope of this ākhyāna (asyākhyānasya viṣaye purāṇaṁ vartate dvijāḥ) 1. 2. 238; all good qualities of actions have this ākhyāna for their resting place (i. e. they are motivated by this ākhyāna) (kriyāguṇānāṁ sarveṣām idam ākhyānam āśrayaḥ) 1. 2. 239 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 2. 387: kriyāḥ laukikyo vaidikyaś ca tāsāṁ guṇāḥ utkṛṣṭaphalasādhanāni/athavā kriyāḥ dānadhyānādayaḥ/guṇāḥ śamādayaḥ). 

  L.   phalaśruti: If one recites with devotion even a quarter of the Bhārata all his sins, without a remainder, get purified (bhāratādhyayanāt puṇyad api pādam adhīyataḥ/śraddadhānasya pūyante sarvapāpāny aśeṣataḥ) 1. 1. 191 (but Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 1. 254: asya ślokasya caturthāṁśoccāraṇamātrād api sarvapāpanāśaḥ kiṁ vācyaṁ kṛtsnādhyayanāt tadarthasya jñānāt sākṣātkārād veti bhāvaḥ); 18. 5. 45 (here, Nī. on Bom. Ed. 18. 5. 59: pādaṁ ślokapādaṁ granthapādaṁ vā); if one were to recite a quarter of the Bhārata for the Brāhmaṇas at the end of a śrāddha he will ensure for the manes inexhaustible food and drink (yaś cainaṁ (? idam cf. 1. 56. 29) śrāvayec chrāddhe brāhmaṇān pādam antataḥ/akṣayyam annapānam tat pitṝṁs tasyopatiṣṭhati) 1. 1. 203; 18. 5. 36 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 18. 5. 42: antataḥ nikaṭe); 1. 56. 29 (akṣayyaṁ tasya tac chrāddham upatiṣṭhet pitṝn api); after reciting the whole of this Veda of Kṛṣṇa (i. e. the Bhārata) one attains profit, and one will undoubtedly get rid of even the sin of killing an embryo 1. 1. 205; one who recites it for those that are not low, are generous, truthful and believers attains profit 1. 56. 17; even a very cruel person after hearing this Itihāsa will be rid of the sin of killing an embryo 1. 56. 18; one who learns the Bharata when it is being recited need not bathe in the waters of Puṣkara 1. 2. 242; 18. 5. 54; one who recites for others the composition of Vyāsa and one who listens to it, all of them having attained to the place of Brahman become equal to gods 1. 56. 14; this (i. e. listening to the recitation of the Bhārata) is the best means for obtaining a male child (puṁsavanaṁ śreṣṭham), a high road to one's wellbeing (svastyayanaṁ mahat), it should be listened to by the chief queen and the crown prince 1. 56. 20; (of one who narrates this), his sons are obedient to him and his servants do him good (putrāḥ śuśrūṣavaḥ santi preṣyāś ca priyakāriṇaḥ) 1. 56. 22; one who listens to it divests himself quickly of all sins incurred by body, speech, and mind 1. 56. 23; those who listen, without envy, to the great life (story) of the Bhāratas have no fear from disease (in this world), and need have no fear of the next world at all 1. 56. 24; Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana has composed it which helps to acquire wealth, fame, long life, heaven and merit 1. 56. 25; the one who having known it recites it for the Brāhmaṇas on the parvan days is cleansed of his sins, wins heaven for himself and becomes one with Brahman (brahmabhūyaṁ sa gacchati) 1. 56. 28; 18. 5. 35; the sin that one inadvertently commits by day in one's activities disappears if he listens to the Mahābhārata Ākhyāna 1. 56. 30, or is released from it by narrating it in the evening 18. 5. 37 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 18. 5. 43: paścimāyāṁ sandhyāyāṁ paṭhyate ced dinakṛtaṁ pāpaṁ naśyati); one who recites it for the three varṇas with Brāhmaṇas at their head is cleansed of his sins, obtains fame and undoubtedly achieves the greatest perfection (gacchet paramikāṁ siddhim) 18. 5. 4344; or one who studies attentively (paṭhet susamāhitaḥ) the Mahābhārata Ākhyāna will undoubtedly attain the greatest perfection 18. 5. 53.

  E.   Past events: (1) Bhṛgus acted as priests in the sacrifices of Kṛtavīrya (also cf. 13. 56. 2); he gave them corn and wealth at the end of Soma sacrifices (dhānyena ca dhanena ca); after the death of Kṛtavīrya, his kinsmen, when in need of money, asked eminent Bhṛgus to give it since they knew Bhṛgus had wealth; some Bhṛgus, afraid of Kṣatriyas, parted with their wealth, but others hid it underground; when one of the kings was digging the ground he, by chance, found wealth in the house of a Bhṛgu; the assembled Kṣatriyas, due to anger, disregarded the supplications of the Bhṛgus and killed them all with sharp arrows; they killed even children, yet unborn (ā garbhād anukṛntantaś…) (also cf. 13. 56. 3); when Bhṛgus were thus being extirpated their wives took shelter in mountain Himavant; one of them held her embryo in her thigh for the continuation of the line of her husband (tāsām anyatamā garbhaṁ bhayād dādhāra taijasam/ūruṇaikena vāmorūr bhartur kulavivṛddhaye//); when the embryo came out breaking the thigh he deprived the Kṣatrīyas of their eyesight; the Kṣatriyas begged pardon of the Bhṛgu wife 1. 169. 11-22; the Bhṛgupatnī told the Kṣatriyas that she had not deprived them of their eyesight; that was done by the angry Bhārgava (Aurva); since the Kṣatriyas started killing even the unborn Bhṛgus she had held her embryo in the thigh for a hundred years; in order to do a favour to the Bhṛgu lineage, the entire Veda along with the six Vedāṅgas entered her child even when he was unborn; the child angered by the death of his ancestors (Bhṛgus) at the hands of Kṣatriyas had deprived them of their eyesight and wished to kill them 1. 170. 1-5; Aurva told the Kṣatriyas born in the lineage of Kṛtavīrya that while he was in the thigh of his mother he had heard the cry of his mothers (ārāvaṁ mātṛvargasya bhṛgūṇāṁ) due to the killings of Kṣatriya; he was angered because the wretched Kṣatriyas killed Bhṛgus not sparing even those unborn; when nobody offered shelter to the wives of Bhṛgus due to fear, one of them had concealed him in her thigh (1. 171. 5, 6, 8); Aurva practised severe penance to take revenge of the Bhṛgus who were killed by destroying the worlds; he thought he would delight the dead Bhṛgus (icchann apacitiṁ kartuṁ bhṛgūṇāṁ bhṛgusattamaḥ 1. 170. 11; Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 1. 179. 10: ātmano manaḥ sarveṣāṁ apacitiṁ kartuṁ pravaṇaṁ unmukhaṁ icchan svamanopacitiṁ kartuṁ yojayatīty arthaḥ); the dead Bhṛgus then descended from the world of Fathers (pitṛlokād upāgamya) and asked him to control his anger; they assured him that the Bhṛgus disregarded their getting killed by Kṣatriyas not because of their weakness; they preferred getting killed by Kṣatriyas because they themselves were tired of their long life (āyuṣā hi prakṛṣṭena yadā naḥ kheda āviśat/tadāsmābhir vadhas tāta kṣatriyair īpsitaḥ svayam//); some one hid wealth in the house of a Bhṛgu in order to anger Kṣatriyas; Bhṛgus desired heaven, and had no longing for wealth, however, death was powerless to overtake Bhṛgus and suicide would deprive them from getting good worlds; hence they found some other way out (to get killed by Kṣatriyas); what Aurva had wanted to achieve by the exercise of his penance was not approved by Bhṛgus; so they asked him to desist from doing the sinful act of destroying the worlds 1. 170. 11-21; (2) Cyavana told Kuśika the above account and added that due to the energy of Bhṛgus (bhṛgūṇām eva tejasā) in his dynasty his grandson would be an ascetic Brāhmaṇa (vipra for vipraḥ ?) having the lustre of fire; he also told him that a matrimonial alliance would be established between him (Kuśika's line) and the Bhṛgus (bhavitā tvaṁ ca saṁbandhī bhṛgūṇāṁ bhāvitātmanām) 13. 56. 1-14); (bhṛgūṇāṁ kuśikānāṁ ca prati saṁbandhakāraṇam) 13. 56. 19; (3) Rāma Jāmadagnya filled at Samantapañcaka five ponds with blood of Kṣatriyas where he offered libations to his forefathers (i. e. Bhṛgus) (triḥsaptakṛtvaḥ pṛthivīṁ kṛtvā niḥkṣatriyāṁ prabhuḥ/ samantapañcake pañca cakāra rudhirahradān//sa teṣu tarpayām āsa pitṝn bhṛgukulodvahaḥ) 3. 117. 9-10; (4) Vāyu told Arjuna (Kārtavīrya) that he would face in future a great danger from the Bhṛgus (bhṛgubhyas te bhayaṁ ghoraṁ…) 13. 142. 23; (5) As an instance of the superiority of Brahmanical lustre and strength over that of the Kṣatriyas was cited the past event of Bhṛgus defeating Tālajaṅghas (bhṛgavo 'jayaṁs tālajaṅghān) 13. 34. 16; (6) Bhṛgus and Aṅgirases mentioned among those who attended the anointment of Skanda as the leader of the army of the gods 9. 44. 8; (7) At the Raudra muhūrta Indra saw in the east Agni entering the sun with offerings which were offered by Aṅgirases and Bhṛgus 3. 213. 29.

Eminence: Vāsuki mentioned first when serpents listed according to their eminence (yathāśreṣṭhān) 5. 101. 8, 9; gods consecrated at the Nāgadhanvan tīrtha Vāsuki as the king of all serpents 9. 36. 29-30; one who bathes in Godāvarī obtains Vāsuki's world 3. 83. 30; one who bathes in Vāsuki's tīrtha gets the fruit of performing the aśvamedha sacrifice 3. 83. 81; as the best among the serpents, Vāsuki reckoned as one of the vibhūtis of Bhagavān (sarpāṇām asmi vāsukiḥ 6. 32. 28); often called ‘the king or the best of the serpents’: nāgarāj 1. 35. 7; nāgarāja 1. 49. 1, 4, 12 (nāgarājaº 1. 44. 18); nāgarājan 1. 16. 13, (1. 49. 11); pannagarāja 1. 44. 21; 9. 36. 30; (sarva) pannagarājan 9. 36. 31; nāgapati 1. 43. 9; pannageśvara 1. 33. 29; 1. 44. 9; 1, 48. 20; 1. 49. 14; 9. 44. 48; nāgendra 1. 35. 12; 1. 42. 17, 18; 1. 44. 14; 1. 49. 21; pannagendra 1. 43. 5; pannagottama 1. 13. 36; 1. 44. 15; 1. 49. 18, 23; 9. 36. 31; pannagasattama 1. 33. 1; bhujagaśresṭha 1. 44. 2. 

  F.   Role in churning of the ocean for nectar: Vāsuki was used as the churning cord (netra 1. 16. 12; 1. 35. 4) by the gods and the demons at the time of samudramanthana; his one end was held by the great asuras, the tail by all the gods; the serpent Ananta stood near Nārāyaṇa and raised up and threw down again and again the head of Vāsuki; from the mouth of Vāsuki, whose body was forcibly dragged at the time of churning, smoky winds with fire came out repeatedly which turned into clouds and lightnings and showered rain on the gods fatigued due to the labour of churning the ocean 1. 16. 13-16. 

  G.   Vāsuki and the snake sacrifice of Janamejaya: When Vāsuki heard the curse of Kadrū, the mother of serpents, that they would be burnt in the snake sacrifice of Janamejaya (1. 13. 35), he held consultations with his brother Airāvata and other serpents to think of the remedy to nullify the curse (śāpo 'yaṁ na bhavet katham 1. 33. 1); he told them that all curses had a cure, but the curse of a mother would be difficult to avert, especially when the curse was uttered within the hearing of the imperishable god (i. e. Brahman) (cf. 1. 18. 9) and the god did not stop her from uttering the terrible curse; yet they had to find a way out before it was too late; they had to see if the snake sacrifice of Janamejaya did not get started or, if started, it could be defeated in its purpose (yathā sa yajño na bhaved yathā vāpi parābhavet 1. 33. 9) 1. 33. 1-9; he listened to the suggestions made by serpents to avoid the snake sacrifice but did not agree with any one of them; he himself had nothing better to offer, hence he was worried 1. 33. 29-31; at that time Elāpatra informed Vāsuki that since Pitāmaha Brahman had prophesied that the son of the great sage Jaratkāru born of his wife having the same name would stop the snake sacrifice and free virtuous serpents from danger, Vāsuki should give in marriage his sister, who was named Jaratkāru, to the sage, when he came begging for a maiden; that would put an end to the fear of the serpents 1. 34. 1-18; earlier, after the churning of the ocean, the gods had taken Vāsuki to Pitāmaha Brahman and told him that Vāsuki was very much disturbed due to the curse of his mother and that Pitāmaha should free him from his mental agony; they pointed out that Vāsuki had always acted for the benefit of the gods and for what was dear to them; Pitāmaha had then told the gods that when the occasion arrived Vāsuki should act according to the advice of Elāpatra 1. 35. 5-7; 1. 48. 25; 1. 49. 9-13, 25; thereafter Vāsuki took great care of his sister Jaratkāru knowing her to be the saviour of serpents 1. 35. 2; Vāsuki appointed various serpents to watch for Jaratkāru and report to him when Jaratkāru arrived asking for a wife 1. 35. 12-13; when Jaratkāru arrived Vāsuki's attendants informed him about Jaratkāru's intention to marry a girl of his name and who was offered as alms; knowing this Vāsuki approached the sage Jaratkāru with his well-adorned sister; the sage asked Vāsuki his sister's name and also told him that even after marriage it would be Vāsuki's responsibility to maintain her 1. 42. 16-20; Vāsuki assured Jaratkāru that his sister had the same name as the sage and that he would support her even after marriage with all his might 1. 42. 16-20; 1. 43. 1-2; 1. 13. 30-34; Jaratkāru then went to Vāsuki's residence and married his sister; Jaratkāru went with his wife to the shining house (vāsagṛhaṁ śubhram 1. 43. 5) approved by Vāsuki 1. 43. 3-5; when the sage Jaratkāru left his wife he asked her to inform Vāsuki about his departure and that he had lived happily with him 1. 43. 29; Jaratkāru's wife pleaded with the sage that he should not abandon her; he should realize what Vāsuki would feel if he knew that her husband had left her without blessing her with a son-that being the principal purpose of their marriage--1. 43. 32-34; when Vāsuki knew about Jaratkāru's departure he was sorry; but he would not pursue the sage fearing that he might curse him; he knew it was improper to ask his sister if she was with a child from Jaratkāru but the seriousness of the matter prompted him to do that (kiṁ hi kāryagarīyastvāt tatas tvāham acūcudam 1. 44. 6); Vāsuki's sister assured him that she had conceived from Jaratkāru and that a lustrous son will be born to her; she removed his anxiety; on hearing the news Vāsuki was happy; he honoured his sister by giving gifts 1. 44. 1-15; later when the snake sacrifice began Vāsuki was highly disturbed due to the death of a large number of serpents and feared that he himself might fall into the fire; he therefore told his sister Jaratkāru that the time had came for her son Āstīka to intervene and stop the destruction of the snakes 1. 48. 1926; accordingly Jaratkāru asked her son to fulfil the purpose for which she was married to Jaratkāru; on enquiry, Jaratkāru told Āstīka why Vāsuki gave her to the sage Jaratkāru 1. 49. 1-15; Āstīka assured Vāsuki, who was terribly upset, that he would release him from the curse and remove his fear 1. 49. 17-21; when Vāsuki again expressed his anxiety by saying that he felt he was revolving, that his heart was bursting, and that he had lost sense of directions as he was afflicted by the punishment inflicted by Brahman (āstīka parighūrṇāmi hṛdayaṁ me vidīryate/diśaś ca na prajānāmi brahmadaṇḍanipīḍitaḥ 1. 49. 22), Āstika reassured him that he would destroy Vāsuki's fear of brahmadaṇḍa 1. 49. 22-24; later after accomplishing his difficult task Āstīka returned to his mother and maternal uncle (Vāsuki) and reported to them all that had happened at Janamejaya's snake sacrifice; all the serpents present were happy to receive the news 1. 53. 17-18. 

  H.   Functions and Events: (1) He is one of the nāgas who wait upon Varuṇa in his sabhā without feeling fatigue 2. 9. 8, 11; (2) present among those who arrived to greet the birth of Arjuna 1. 114. 60; (3) he sided with Arjuna when those who had gathered in the mid-region to watch the battle took sides between Arjuna and Karṇa 8. 63. 36; (4) he was one of the snakes who received the white serpent issuing from Balarāma's mouth and entering the ocean 16. 5. 14, 12; (5) after Skanda's consecration as the leader of the army (9. 43. 48) and when gifts were given to Skanda, Vāsuki gave him two snakes, Jaya and Mahājaya 9. 44. 48; (6) when Uttaṅka blew into the anus of the horse (god Fire), the house of Vāsuki and other prominent snakes in the nāgaloka were covered with smoke 14. 57. 46-47.

  B.   Description: heavenly (divya) 5. 155. 6; 3. 21. 24 (dhanuṣā divyena not named); splendid (rucira) 3. 23. 1; best (uttama) 5. 155. 9; lustrous (tejomaya) 5. 155. 6; causing fear to the army of the enemy (parasenābhayāvaha) 5. 155. 6. 

  C.   Association with Kṛṣṇa: As Kṛṣṇa's bow, it is mentioned among the weapons placed on his chariot when he started from the Khāṇḍavaprastha to Dvārakā 2. 2. 12; Kṛṣṇa asked his charioteer Dāruka to place the bow (not named) in his chariot when it was to be made ready for Kṛṣṇa's eventual intervention in the war 7. 56. 32; Śārṅga bow, along with conch, disc, mace and Śakti appeared on Kṛṣṇa's different arms when he manifested his fierce form, as a great wonder, in the Sabhā of the Kauravas 5. 129. 9-10; Kṛṣṇa (and Viṣṇu) have epithets like śārṅgadhanvan 3. 120. 6; 3. 189. 30; 5. 73. 2; 5. 135. 30; 6. 61. 35; 7. 9. 71; 8. 5. 16 (śārṅgaº ºdhanvan); 10. 13. 6, 9; 12. 200. 6; 13. 135. 120; 14. 52. 6; 16. 9. 14; śārṅgadhanurdhara 6. 61. 45; śārṅgarathāṅgapāṇi 6. 55. 94; śārṅgagadādhara 2. 41. 33; śārṅgacakragadādhara 2. 42. 34; 16. 4. 44; śārṅgacakrāsipāṇi 12. 43. 16. 

  D.   Use: Kṛṣṇa used it in his fight with Śālva; Kṛṣṇa's arrows released from Śārṅga first failed to reach the Saubhapura of Śālva 3. 21. 18; he again released ayutas of arrows against Śālva from his heavenly bow 3. 21. 24; the arrows released from Śārṅga pierced the bodies of the demons in the Saubhapura and they fell down in the ocean 3. 21. 28; due to the māyā of Śālva, Kṛṣṇa saw the son of Śūra (Vasudeva) falling down from the Saubha; as a result, he was confused and the Śārṅga slipped down from his hand 3. 22. 22-25; when Kṛṣṇa knew the truth, he picked up the splendid bow and shot arrows from it which cut off the heads of the enemies 3. 23. 1-2. 

  E.   Status: The Śārṅga bow of Viṣṇu counted among the only three heavenly bows of divine beings, the other two being Gāṇḍiva of Varuṇa and Vijaya of Mahendra (trīṇy evaitāni divyāni dhanūṁṣi divicāriṇām) 5. 155. 5; hence the Vijaya bow obtained by Rukmin is said to be comparable with the Śārṅga 5. 155. 4.

*2nd word in right half of page p910  (+offset) in original book.Supratīka^1  : m.: Name of Bhagadatta's elephant. 

  A.   Description: big (mahādvipa 6. 91. 41; 7. 25. 36; 7. 27. 29; 7. 28. 39); excellent, chief or king of the elephants (gajapravara 6. 91. 52; nāgapravara 7. 25. 20, 58; vāraṇottama 6. 17. 36; dviparṣabha 7. 25. 35; dviradaśreṣṭha 7. 26. 5; nāgendra 6. 91. 36; gajapati 6. 91. 43; nāgarāja 6. 79. 25; 7. 25. 56); very swift (āśugati 7. 25. 39), hence although one, appeared to enemies like hundreds or hosts of elephants 7. 25. 39, 59; never fatigued, the elephant always achieved his objective in battles (saṁkhye kṛtakarmā jitaklamaḥ) 7. 26. 5; indescribable, unrivalled in battles (sadāpratigajo yudhi/sarvaśabdātigaḥ) 7. 26. 5; white like silver (rajatopama 6. 112. 57); compared with elephant of Indra (mahendragajasaṁnibha 6. 112. 55); at one place Supratīka actually identified with the elephant of Indra (yena nāgena maghavān ajayad daityadānavān/sa nāgapravaro bhīmaṁ sahasā samupādravat) 7. 25. 20; yet also said to be in appearance (dark ?) like a cloud (jīmūtasaṁkāśān nāgāt 7. 27. 24). 

  B.   Part in the epic war: Ordered by Bhīsma, Bhagadatta with his elephant in rut (not named) rushed against Bhīma; Abhimanyu and other heroes pierced the elephant with arrows; incited, the elephant ran with double speed; the rutting elephant, goaded by Bhagadatta, attacked with double speed the Pāṇḍava warriors like the God of Death; seeing his big form all the great warriors on the side of the Pāṇḍavas became uneasy 6. 60. 37-44; Ghaṭotkaca drove his elephant against Bhagadatta in order to kill him and his elephant; the other elephants driven by the Rākṣasas also attacked Bhagadatta's elephant with tusks; afflicted by the attack and pierced with arrows, Bhagadatta's elephant roared loudly like a thunder; hearing it Bhīṣma reported to Droṇa and Duryodhaṇa that Bhagadatta must be in danger 6. 60. 5357; in another battle between Bhagadatta and Ghaṭotkaca, the latter tried to kill the former's elephant (Supratīka not named, referred to as prāgjyotiṣagaja) with a śakti, but it was cut into three pieces by Bhagadatta 6. 79. 37-38; Bhagadatta, mounted on Supratīka, attacked the Pāṇḍava heroes (6. 91. 23); Bhagadatta, seated on Supratīka's head (supratīkaśirogataḥ 6. 91. 33), ichor flowing from Supratīka's temples in seven streams, attacked Bhīma 6. 91. 31-33, 37; Pāṇḍava warriors encircled Supratīka on all sides; Supratīka attacked by the mountain-like elephant of the king of the Daśārṇa country 6. 91. 40, 42; Bhagadatta goaded his elephant Supratīka with his hook and toe (aṅkuśāṅguṣṭhanuditaḥ sa gajapravaro yudhi 6. 91. 52); running hither and thither Supratīka crushed chariots, horses together with their riders, and footsoldiers in hundreds and thousands; as a result the Pāṇḍava army squeezed like a piece of skin placed on fire; in order to kill Supratīka Ghaṭotkaca hurled his śūla against him, but Bhagadatta protected him by cutting down the śūla 6. 91. 53-54, 57-58; Bhagadatta, with his Supratīka crushing the Pāṇḍava army, rushed towards Yudhiṣṭhira 6. 91. 79; Arjuna with great effort checked the advance of Supratīka and pierced him with sharp arrows made of ayas 6. 112. 55, 57; in the fight of Bhagadatta with Bhīma, the former's elephant (Supratīka not named) appeared to kill Bhīma 7. 25. 19-24; Bhagadatta on his elephant fought the army of the Pāṇḍavas and the Pāñcālas 7. 25. 24-27, and the army led by Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 25. 32-41; Bhagadatta's elephant took hold of Sātyaki's chariot and hurled it away 7. 25. 36; in the encounter between Bhagadatta's elephant and the elephant of the king of Daśārṇas the former proved victorious 7. 25. 28-30; in the encounter between Bhīma and Bhagadatta, the latter's elephant frightened Bhīma's horses by sprinkling water on them 7. 25. 43; he shattered the charioteer of Yuyutsu by stepping on his horses 7. 25. 49; Bhagadatta charged his elephant against Kṛṣṇa and Arjuṇa to kill them; seeing him rush like the angry God of Death, Kṛṣṇa avoided frontal attack by quickly driving Arjuna's chariot around the elephant keeping him on the right (cakre 'pasavyaṁ tvaritaḥ syandanena janārdanaḥ 7. 27. 28); although Supratīka was within his reach, Arjuna, remembering the rule (of the war), did not kill the elephant together with Bhagadatta from behind (saṁprāptam api neyeṣa parāvṛttaṁ mahādvipam/sārohaṁ mṛtyusātkartuṁ smaran dharmaṁ dhanaṁjayaḥ 7. 27. 29); Bhagadatta's elephant then sent many elephants and horses to death and crushed the chariots 7. 27. 27-30. 

  C.

Comparisons: (1) with mountain: (a) Supratīka with ichor issuing out at seven places compared with a mountain with water flowing down on all sides 6. 91. 32; (b) pierced by arrows and blood issuing from his body, Supratīka looked like Himavant coloured with red minerals (dhātucitra ivādrirāṭ) 6. 91. 41; (c) fight between Supratīka and the elephant of the king of Daśārṇas compared with that of two winged mountains 7. 25. 29; (d) Bhagadatta's elephant frightened the enemies as formerly the chief winged mountain frightened (its enemies ?) 7. 25. 56; (e) Bhagadatta's elephant devoid of his armour looked like the king of the mountains bereft of clouds 7. 28. 8; (2) with other elephants: (a) Supratīka with Bhagadatta seated on him and shooting arrows compared with Airāvata with Indra seated on him and sending down streams of water 6. 91 33, (5. 16. 38); (b) Bhagadatta on elephant destroying Pāṇḍava army compared with Indra on his Airāvata destroying the Dānavas 7. 25. 40; (c) Bhagadatta's elephant crushed the Pāṇḍava army as a wild elephant crushes a host of lotuses 6. 79. 41; (3) with cloud: Bhagadatta's elephant pierced by arrows looked like a big cloud penetrated by sun's rays 7. 25. 52; (4) with ocean: Bhagadatta's elephant frightened the enemies as ocean frightens the merchants 7. 25. 56; (5) with shore of the ocean: Supratīka checked the onslaught of the elephant of the Daśārṇa king as the shore checks the advance of the ocean 6. 91. 43; (6) with arrow: Supratīka, discharged against Bhīma, sped like an arrow discharged from the bow-string 6. 91. 37; (7) with fire: Supratīka goaded by Bhagadatta looked like the Saṁvartaka fire 6. 91. 52. 

  E.   End: Bhagadatta, with his elephant Supratīka, was killed (śasta) by Arjuna 1. 2. 161; in the final encounter of Bhagadatta with Arjuna, the latter cut down the armour of Bhagadatta's elephant (Supratīka not named) 7. 28. 8; he struck the elephant between the temples with the nārāca arrow; the arrow went deep upto its feathered part; with the limbs stiffened and the tusks piercing the ground, the elephant fell down; he died roaring aloud 7. 28. 37, 39.

  E.   Meeting with Bhīma: When Bhīma was wandering on the peaks of the Gandhamādana mountain in search of heavenly lotus flowers having heavenly fragrance, he made big noise with his conch near the thicket of banana trees; hearing it, the lions and the elephants roared; the big noise aroused Hanūmant who was asleep in the thicket; as he woke up, yawning, he hit the ground with his large tail which looked like the flag staff of Indra and produced sound like a thunder; when Bhīma marched forward to search the source of this sound he saw Hanūmant lying on a thick stoneslab in the midst of the banana trees 3. 146. 59-64; description of Hanūmant 3. 146. 6571; when Bhīma roared loudly Hanūmant opened his eyes a little, looked despisingly at Bhīma, and asked Bhīma why he woke him up who was happily asleep; he told Bhīma that as an intelligent human being Bhīma should have shown compassion for other beings; Bhīma therefore did not know his dharma; Hanūmant then asked Bhīma the purpose of his arriving at a place which was not supposed to be visited by human beings; the mountain, beyond that point, could not be crossed unless one had acquired perfection (siddhagati 3. 146. 79); Hanūmant advised Bhīma to eat the roots and fruits to be found there which were as good as amṛta and return 3. 146. 72-81; when Bhīma introduced himself to Hanūmant as a Pāṇḍava and son of Vāyu, Hanūmant responded with a smile but asked Bhīma to return rather than proceed further and meet with danger; when Bhīma insisted that he must proceed and for that purpose Hanūmant should get away from his path, Hanūmant replied that it was not possible for him to move as he was suffering from an ailment; if Bhīma must proceed he should cross over him; when Bhīma said he was prepared to go beyond him and the mountain as Hanūmant had crossed the ocean, Hanūmant asked Bhīma who was that Hanūmant, Bhīma replied that Hanūmant was his brother, meritorious, brave and intelligent, famous in the Rāmāyaṇa; he crossed the ocean to find out Rāma's wife; knowing Bhīma to be arrogant due to the strength of his arms, Hanūmant again told him that as he could not move due to old age Bhīma should set aside his tail from the path and proceed; Bhīma failed in his attempt to lift the tail and stood with his face turned down due to shame; he bowed down to Hanūmant asking for forgiveness; Bhīma requested Hanūmant to reveal his identity and let him know whether he was a siddha, a god, a Gandharva, or a Guhyaka in the form of a monkey 3. 147. 17-22; Hanūmant then told Bhīma who he really was and that he used to live with Sugrīva on the Ṛśyamūka mountain since the latter was cheated by his brother Vālin 3. 147. 27; Hanūmant further told Bhīma that he had gone out with other crores of monkeys in search of Sītā and was informed by a vulture (Jaṭāyus) about Sītā; he had then jumped over the ocean, one hundred yojanas wide, seen Sītā in Rāvaṇa's house, and returned after announcing himself to Rāvaṇa; when Rāma finally started (for Ayodhyā) Hanūmant had asked the following boon from Rāma: “May I live as long as the story of Rāma lasts”; the boon was granted to him; Gandharvas and Apsarases sing the narrative of Rāma (tasya vīrasya caritam 3. 147. 39) to please Hanūmant; Hanūmant again told Bhīma that no mortal could go beyond the point where they met since it was frequented by the gods; Hanūmant informed Bhīma that he had blocked Bhīma's way les the should be attacked or cursed by some one, and that the lake he was searching for was close by 3. 147. 33-41; Bhīma then told Hanūmant that he was highly blessed by his meeting with Hanūmant; Bhīma requested him to show the unrivalled form which he had assumed when he leapt over the ocean; only then Bhīma would believe what Hanūmant had told about himself; Hanūmant informed Bhīma that it was not possible to assume forms of the bygone age; one acquired the strength, form and prowess according to the yuga in which one lived; he had to follow the (rule of the) yuga, since no one could go beyond Time (yuge yuge/balavarṣmaprabhāvā hi prahīyanty udbhavanti ca…yugaṁ samanuvartāmi kālo hi duratikramaḥ 3. 148. 7, 8); when Bhīma persisted in his request, Hanūmant increased his body immensely to look like mountain Maināka and showed Bhīma the form he had assumed to cross the ocean 3. 149. 2-4; description of the body 3. 149. 4-7, 13; Hanūmant told Bhīma that he could grow even more, as much as he liked; Bhīma then requested Hanūmant to assume his former shape 3. 149. 8-12 (Hanumant st. 8) when Bhīma asked why Rāma himself had to go to Rāvaṇa when Hanūmant could destroy Laṅkā, Hanūmant told him that if he had killed Rāvaṇa, Rāma's fame would have suffered 3. 149. 14-20; Hanūmant then permitted Bhīma to depart and showed him the way leading to the Saugandhikavana and the garden of Kubera; he warned Bhima not to pluck the flowers himself and asked him to show regard for the deities; he asked Bhīma not to act rashly but follow the dharma 3. 149. 21-24; Hanūmant then gave a long discourse on dharma to Bhīma (explaining to him trayī, vārtā and daṇḍanīti; the duties of the four varṇas; the conduct of a king) 3. 149. 26-52; Hanūmant contracted his body and embraced Bhīma; the embrace removed Bhīma's fatigue; with faltering voice and tears in his eyes Hanūmant asked Bhīma to remember him and not to tell anyone of his whereabouts; having embraced a mortal (Bhīma) Hanūmant was happy to be reminded of Rāma; Hanūmant offered a boon to Bhīma: if Bhīma so wished Hanūmant could go Hāstinapura and kill the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra or crush their town with a rock 3. 150. 1-9; but Bhīma told Hanūmant that he (H.) had already done all that he could do for Bhīma; instead of a boon he only asked for Hanūmant's forgiveness and favour; the Paṇḍavas had found in Hanūmant their support which would help them to win the war; hearing that Hanūmant told Bhīma that due to brotherly feelings and friendliness (bhrātṛtvāt sauhṛdāc cāpi 3. 150. 13), whenever Bhīma roared in battles, Hanūmant would add his roar to it and increase its volume; he would stand on the flag-staff of Arjuna and roar which would deprive the enemies of their lives; hence Arjuna's banner often described as marked by a monkey (vānara, kapi, śākhāmṛga, but the monkey is not named Hanūmant) 5. 47. 46; 5. 59. 13; 6. 56. 7, 9, 20, 27; 6. 67. 3; 6. 78. 9; 6. 112. 114; 7. 9. 14; 7. 17. 21; 7. 80. 8, 9 (the monkey terrified the army of the Kauravas); 7. 80. 29; 7. 102. 6; 7. 114. 81; 9. 9. 59; 10. 12. 25; 14. 51. 54; 14. 82. 29; 14. 83. 12, 23. so saying Hanūmant disappeared 3. 150. 14-15. 

  F.   Meeting with Rāma and the fight between Vālin and Sugrīva: When Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa arrived on top of the Ṛśyamūka mountain and saw five monkeys, Hanūmant, as a messenger of Sugrīva, approached them; Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa first talked with Hanūmant and then approached Sugrīva to form friendship with him 3. 264. 9-11; (later, in the fight between Vālin and Sugrīva) when Rāma could not distinguish between them, Hanūmant stuck a garland round the neck of Sugrīva 3. 264. 33. 

  G.   Search for Sītā: After the search for Sītā, when Hanūmant and the other monkey-chiefs were returning to the Ṛśyamūka mountain, on way they rested in the madhuvana; Sugrīva interpreted this behaviour (praṇaya 3. 266. 28) as indicatig that Hanūmant and others were successful in their mission; the monkeychiefs who had gone for the search then approached Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa and Sugrīva 3. 266. 26-30; looking at the complexion of Hanūmant and his gait Rāma understood that he had seen Sītā; Hanūmant informed Rāma that he had brought the good tidings; he then described to Rāma his search for Sītā in the south 3. 266. 31-55 (meeting the female ascetic Prabhāvatī in the house of the Daitya Maya; meeting with Saṁpāti and obtaining from him the information that Sītā must be with Ṛāvaṇa in Laṅkā and that Laṅkā lay beyond the ocean); when no one was prepared to cross the ocean, Hanūmant did it after entering his father (i. e. Vāyu: tataḥ pitaram āviśya pupluve 'haṁ māhārṇavam) and killing on way an acquatic Rākṣasī (jalarākṣasī) 3. 266. 57; in Laṅkā, Hanūmant saw Sītā in the inner apartment of Rāvaṇa (tatra sītā mayā dṛṣṭā rāvaṇāntaḥpure satī 3. 266. 58); having determined her identity Hanūmant approached her and told her that he was the son of god Wind and the messenger of Rāma; he told Sītā that Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were safe and had enquired after Sītā's well-being; he assured her that he was a monkey and not a Rakṣasa, and that Rāma would soon arrive in Laṅkā with his monkeys; Sītā told him that she knew him already to be Hanūmant as was reported to her by the Rākṣasa Avindhya; she gave Hanūmant a jewel and permitted him to leave; to convince Rāma that Hanūmant had met her, Sītā told him the incident of Rāma throwing a reed at a crow on the Citrakūṭa mountain; Hanūmant then burnt Laṅkā and returned to Rāma 3. 266. 58-68. 

  H.   Encounter with individual demons in Rāma's war with Rāvaṇa: Hanūmant marched at the head of the army when it started towards the sea in the south 3. 267. 16; when the demon Dhūmrākṣa attacked the army of the monkeys, Hanūmant rushed towards him; this act inspired confidence in the monkeys; the fight between the two was fierce like the one between Indra and Prahlāda; Dhūmrākṣa struck Hanūmant with maces (gadā) and clubs (parigha), and Hanūmant retaliated with trees; finally Hanūmant killed Dhūmrākṣa together with his horses, chariot and charioteer 3. 270. 7, 12-14; when Lakṣmaṇa was engaged in fighting with the demons Vajravega and and Pramāthin, Hanūmant attacked Vajravega and killed him with the summit of a mountain (adriśṛṅga) 3. 271. 24; Hanūmant was among the monkey-chiefs who watched over Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa when they fell down on the ground tied with the arrows of Indrajit 3. 273. 4; he was one of those who applied water, sent by Kubera, to their eyes which enabled them to see invisible beings 3. 273. 10-13; Hanūmant and other monkeychiefs surrounded Rāvaṇa when he rushed at Rāma 3. 274. 3. 

  I.   Sītā's boon: At the time of boon-givings after the war Sītā gave Hanūmant the following boon: “You will live as long as the fame of Rāma lasts (rāmakīrtyā samaṁ putra jīvitaṁ te bhavīṣyati), and that the heavenly enjoyments will wait on you” 3. 275. 43-44. 

  J.   Messenger to Bharata: When Rāma approached the city of Ayodhyā he sent Hanūmant to Bharata as his messenger to give him the good news (of Rāma's return); when Hanūmant, came back, Rāma met Bharata at Nandigrāma 3. 275. 59-60.

  Described as ‘looking like the blossom of a reed’ (śaraprasūnasaṁkāśa 12. 136. 30), mobile, and having red eyes; when the mouse Palita was tasting the piece of flesh, he saw below his deadly enemy, the ichneumon Harika, lying in the crevice of the earth; the ichneumon came out quickly as he got the scent of the mouse, looked up, and licked his mouth for food 12. 136. 30-31; (the mouse also noticed Candraka an owl, his another enemy, up in the nest on the branch of the tree 12. 136. 32); the mouse thus faced danger from the ichneumon and the owl at the same time; he realized that Harika would catch him if he rushed to the ground to save himself from the owl 12. 136. 33, 37; the mouse therefore decided to take refuge with the cat, his third enemy, who was trapped in the net; the mouse pointed out to the cat the danger he was facing owing to the evil intention of the ichneumon and the owl; he offered to cut the threads of the trap in which the cat was caught provided the cat offered him protection from Harika and Candraka 12. 136. 72-73; the cat agreed and when Harika and Candraka saw the mouse confidently resting on the body of the cat, they lost hopes of getting the mouse and returned to their respective homes 12. 136. 82.

  A.   Location: Listed by Saṁjaya among the six mountains which stretch towards the east and merge at both ends in the eastern and the western oceans (prāgāyatā mahārāja ṣad ete ratnaparvatāḥ/avagāḍhā hy ubhayataḥ samudrau pūrvapaścimau) 6. 7. 2; the distance between them is thousands of yojanas (teṣām antaraviṣkambho yojanāni sahasraśaḥ) 6. 7. 4; it lies between Haimavatavarṣa and Harivarṣa; the Varṣa beyond Hemakūṭa îs Harivarṣa (idaṁ tu bhārataṁ varṣaṁ tato haimavataṁ param/hemakūṭāt paraṁ caiva harivarṣaṁ pracakṣate) 6. 7. 6; identified with Kailāsa (hemakūṭas tu sumahān kailāso nāma parvataḥ) 6. 7. 39; to the north of Kailāsa and towards Maināka is the Hiraṇyaśṛṅga mountain 6. 7. 40; near the rivers Nandā and Aparanandā (tataḥ prayātaḥ…nandām aparanandāṁ ca nadyau…/sa parvataṁ samāsādya hemakūṭam) 3. 109. 1-2; 3. 109. 18-19. 

  B.   Description: Free from disease (anāmaya) 3. 109. 2; big (mahāgiri) 3. 109. 14; (sumahant) 6. 7. 39; all the six mountains listed by Saṁjaya are full of jewels (ratnaparvatāḥ) 6. 7. 2 and resorted to by Siddhas and Cāraṇas (siddhacāraṇasevitāḥ) 6. 7. 4. 

  C.   Characteristics: (1) Many unthinkable wonders happen on the mountain (acintyān adbhutān bhāvān dadarśa subahūn nṛpaḥ); spoken words turn into clouds and rocks by thousands and hence people cannot climb it (vāco yatrābhavan meghā upalāś ca sahasraśaḥ/nāśaknuvaṁs tam āroḍhum… janāḥ//) 3. 109. 3; wind always blows there and it rains continuously; the oblation bearing god (Fire) can be seen there morning and evening (vāyur nityaṁ vavau yatra nityaṁ devaś ca varṣati/sāyaṁ prātaś ca bhagavān dṛśyate havyavāhanaḥ//) 3. 109. 4; (2) One cannot even look at this mountain, let alone climb it; one who has not practised austerities cannot look at it or climb it (nāśaknuvann abhidraṣṭuṁ kuta evādhirohitum//nātaptatapasā śakyo draṣṭum eṣa mahāgiriḥ/āroḍhuṁ vāpi kaunteya) 3. 109. 13-14; (3) Guhyakas live there (hemakūṭe tu guhyakāḥ) 6. 7. 48; King Vaiśravaṇa, along with the Guhyakas, enjoys himself there (yatra vaiśravaṇo rājā guhyakaiḥ saha modate) 6. 7. 39. 

  D.   Epic event: Yudhiṣṭhira having reached Hemakūṭa saw many wonders there 3. 109. 5; Lomaśa gave to him the explanation of these wonders 3. 109. 6-17 (see the next section); he advised Yudhiṣṭhira to bathe in the river Nandā flowing along the mountain since a bath destroyed the sin instantly 3. 109. 18; he also asked him to restrain his speech (niyatavāg bhava) 3. 109. 14. 

  E.   Past events: (1) An ascetic named Ṛṣabha once lived on this mountain (hence called Ṛṣabhakūṭa ?) and was practising austerities for many hundred years (anekaśatavarṣāyus tapasvī); he got angry when he was drawn into conversation by others; so he told the mountain to release rocks if any one uttered a word there; he summoned wind and bade him not to make noise; hence if any one tried to speak there he was restrained by a cloud (sa vai saṁbhāṣyamāṇo 'nyaiḥ kopād girim uvāca ha/ya iha vyāharet kaścid upalān utsṛjes tadā//vātaṁ cāhūya mā śabdam ity uvāca sa tāpasaḥ/vyāharaṁś caiva puruṣo meghena vinivāryate//) 3. 109. 7-9; (2) When gods formerly came to the river Nandā (flowing near Hemakūṭa) men followed there to see the gods; since the gods, Indra and the rest, did not wish to be seen by men they made the land inaccessible making this mountain an obstacle (durgaṁ cakrur imaṁ deśaṁ giripratyūharūpakam); hence men cannot even look at the mountain, let alone climb it; the gods then always performed best sacrifices there; the signs of those sacrifices could even now be seen in the form of the sprawling dūrvā grass having the form of sacrificial grass (kuśa) and many trees having the shape of sacrificial posts (yūpa) (teṣām etāni liṅgāni dṛśyante 'dyāpi bhārata//kuśākāreva durveyaṁ…yūpaprakārā bahavo vṛkṣāś ceme//) 3. 109. 11-16; (3) Hamakūṭa was one of the mountains seen by Mārkaṇḍeya in the belly of the Bāla (3. 186. 83 = Nārāyaṇa 3. 187. 3) 3. 186. 101.

  Described as a ‘powerful missile’ (paramāstra) 10. 13. 17; 10. 15. 12, 23, 33; 10. 16. 8; ‘heavenly’ (divya) 10. 15. 16, 25; ‘unparalleled’ (durāsada) 10. 15. 16; ‘fierce’ (ghora) 10. 15. 11; ‘unfailing’ (amogha) 10. 15. 31; (10. 16. 8); ‘producing big flames and surrounded by a circle of lustre’ (mahājvālaṁ tejomaṇḍalasaṁvṛtam) 10. 14. 8; when challenged by Bhīma, who was followed by Arjuna and Yudhiṣṭhira in a chariot, driven by Kṛṣṇa, Aśvatthāman took a reed (iṣīkā) in the left hand (saveyna pāṇinā) and thought of the heavenly missile, recited mantras on it to imbibe it with the lustre of fire (vahnitejo 'numantrya vai 10. 15. 16), and released it for the destruction of the Pāṇḍavas (apāṇḍavāya 10. 13. 18; 10. 15. 16); fire broke out from the reed which threatened to burn the three worlds 10. 13. 15-20; to counter it, Arjuna released Brahmaśiras (10. 15. 23) saying ‘let the missile be pacified by missile’ (astram astreṇa śāmyatām) 10. 14. 2-6; 10. 15. 20; (however, according to 1. 1. 155 Arjuna said ‘svasti’ while releasing his missile); apprehending great danger to the creatures from the fire released by the two missiles, Nārada and Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana stood between them and appealed to the two heroes to withdraw their missiles since they were never used by any one before 10. 14. 7-16; accordingly, Arjuna withdrew it (10. 15. 1, 5, 10), but Aśvatthāman could not withdraw it (10. 15. 11) and he admitted to the sages his inability to follow their advice 10. 15. 15; he said the missile must achieve its purpose and destroy all the sons of Pāṇḍu 10. 15. 17; but Vyāsa pointed out that if Aśvatthāman's paramāstra were to subdue Arjuna's Brahmaśiras there would be no rain in the land for twelve years; (however, according to 1. 1. 155 one astra was pacified by the other astram astreṇa śāntam); Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana therefore asked again Aśvatthāman to withdraw his missile and save the nation and the Pāṇḍavas 10. 15. 25-26; but since the missile could not be totally withdrawn, Aśvatthāman suggested that the missile should fall, not on the Pāṇḍavas, but on their foetus (iṣīkā nipatiṣyati/garbheṣu pāṇḍaveyānām 10. 15. 31); when permitted by Vyāsa to do that, Aśvatthāman directed the missile to the foetus 10. 15. 32-33; it was then destined to hit the foetus in the womb of Uttarā 10. 16. 7-8 [See  Aiṣikāstra  and  Brahmaśiras ].

Ed. Vol. II, p. 501).

  A.   Early life: Daughter of Nāgarāja Airāvata (daughter not named here, but apparently identical with Ulūpī); married first to a nāga who was killed by Suparṇa; she had no child; next, given by her father as wife to Arjuna 6. 86. 6-8; her son Irāvant called a dāyāda of Arjuna 6. 86. 11; yet Irāvant described as the son fathered by Arjuna on the wife of another person (parakṣetra) 6. 86. 11 [apparently parakṣetra here intended to mean that Ulūpī was a widow when married to Arjuna; no mention in this narration of Ulūpī's amorous advance (sāhasa) to Arjuna 1. 206. 17.] 

  B.   Meeting with Arjuna: described in the Arjunavanavāsaparvan 1. 2. 91 = 1. 206; she saw Arjuna while bathing in Gaṅgā; fell in love with him and dragged him into water; on enquiry she told Arjuna she was the daughter of the serpent (pannaga) Kauravya born in the family of Airāvata; she requested Arjuna to make her happy by uniting with her; she pleaded that he would not thereby violate his vow to observe celibacy for twelve years since, by uniting with her, he would be offering protection to the distressed and would be saving her life; Arjuna agreed to her request 1. 206. 13-33 [No mention in this narration of Arjuna's marrying her]. 

  C.   Role in Arjuna's battle with Babhruvāhana: Ulūpī enraged when Arjuna rebuked her ‘son’ Babhruvāhana for not offering a fight; she who was versed in the duties of a Kṣatriya (kṣātradharmaviśāradā 14. 78. 10), therefore broke open the earth and appeared on the scene; she introduced herself to Babhruvāhana as his mother and asked him to fight with Arjuna 14. 78. 8-13; Citrāṅgadā, mistaking Arjuna and Babhruvāhana to be dead when they fell unconscious on the ground in the armed conflict that followed, scolded Ulūpī for inciting Babhruvāhana to offer a fight; she requested Ulūpī to bring Arjuna to life, not minding the death of Babhruvāhana 14. 79. 2-7, 12-17; Babhruvāhana, on gaining consciousness scolded Ulūpī for the same reason 14. 80. 13-15; Ulūpī told Babhruvāhana that Arjuna was not really dead but was in a swoon as she had employed mohinī māyā; she asked Babhruvāhana to fight because Arjuna wanted to put his strength to test; she then thought of the saṅjīvana maṇi and asked Babhruvāhana to place it on Arjuna's chest to bring him back to consciousness 14. 81. 2, 4-7, 9-10; Arjuna, when revived, asked Ulūpī the reason for her presence on the battle-field 14. 82. 1-4; she told Arjuna that what she did was for the atonement (niṣkṛti) and pacification (śānti) through his son for his sinful act in felling down Bhīṣma in an unlawful way (adharmeṇa) 14. 82. 8-11; when Bhīṣma fell, Vasus cursed Arjuna, whereupon Ulūpī requested her father to intercede on behalf of Arjuna; Ulūpī's inciting Babhruvāhana was to release Arjuna from that curse; Arjuna expressed satisfaction at what Ulūpī had done 14. 82. 15-22; Arjuna invited Babhruvāhana to attend the Aśvamedha with his two mothers (Ulūpī and Citrāṅgadā) and took leave of his wives 14. 82. 24, 32. 

  D.   Later life and End: She was one of those who waited on Gāndhārī 15. 1. 21; Sāmba, a Brāhmaṇa assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra on behalf of his subjects that neither Kuntī, nor Draupadī, nor Ulūpī, nor Subhadrā would do anything harmful to the people 15. 16. 20; she entered Gaṅgā when the Pāṇḍavas finally left Hāstinapura 17. 1. 25. 

  E.   Epithets: pannagātmajā (and synonymous expressions) 14. 78. 11; 14. 79. 7, 8; 14. 79. 2, 18; 14. 82. 2; 17. 1. 25; 14. 78. 10; 14. 82. 5; nāgarājasutā (and its synonyms) 1. 206. 16; 6. 86. 6; 14. 80. 13; 1. 206. 33; 14. 81. 3; bhujagottamā 14. 80. 17; Kauravyaduhitā 14. 82. 23; Kauravyakulanandinī 14. 82. 1; jalacāriṇī 1. 206. 33; devī 14. 79. 8.

He told serpents what he heard when he crawled into the lap of his mother when the curse was pronounced by her; Brahmā had told the gods the remedy partially to avoid the effect of the curse; he therefore advised Vāsuki to give his sister Jaratkāru to give in marriage to sage Jaratkāru; their son would stop the sacrifice of snakes 1. 34. 1-18; his advice was received with joy by serpents 1. 35. 1; Brahmā informed gods that what Elāpatra had told the snakes was exactly what he had in mind; Elāpatra's advice was to the advantage of the serpents and that it would prove true 1. 35. 8, 11.

  B.   Dutiful and intelligent wife: She forbade Vālin from starting out of their residence when he heard Sugrīva's loud roar; from the way Sugrīva roared, she feared he had found a protector; since Tārā could understand the meaning of the cries of all beings (sarvabhūtarutajñā 3. 264. 19), Vālin asked her to find out whose protection Sugrīva had secured; after contemplating for a while she told Vālin incidents beginning with the abduction of Sītā upto Sugrīva's entering into an alliance with Rāma; she also told him about the helpers of Rāma; in the opinion of Tārā all these helpers, intelligent and strong, were capable of destroying Vālin; Vālin misunderstood Tārā's advice and doubted that she secretly loved Sugrīva; he spoke harsh words to her and went out 3. 264. 16-25; in the end Tārā saw Vālin fallen on the ground.

*5th word in left half of page p360  (+offset) in original book.Tretā  : f.,  Tretāyuga  nt.: Name of the second Yuga among the four Yugas. 

  A.   Place among the four Yugas: Second, occurs after Kṛta, hence mentioned after it (pūrvaṁ kṛtayugaṁ nāma tatas tretāyugaṁ vibho) 6. 11. 4; 6. 11. 3; 12. 224. 18; 12. 323. 50-51; after Tretā follows Dvāpara (tretānirmokṣasamaye dvāparapratipādane) 12. 139. 14; hence the junction of these two yugas is referred to (tretādvāparayoḥ sandhau) 1. 2. 3; 12. 139. 13; 12. 326. 78. 

  B.   Duration: Mārkaṇḍeya told Yudhiṣṭhira that the duration of the Tretā Yuga was three thousand years, with dawns of three hundred years and twilights of the same duration (trīṇi varṣasahasrāṇi tretāyugam ihocyate/tasya tāvacchatī saṁdhyā saṁdhyāṁśas ca tataḥ param//… saṁdhyāsaṁdhyāṁśayos tulyaṁ pramāṇam upadhāraya) 3. 186. 19, 21 (for Nī.'s explanation of saṁdhyā and saṁdhyāṁśa, see  Kali,  Section 

  C.  ); the same duration was told by Vyāsa to Śuka without specifically naming the Yuga but in relation to Kṛta (itareṣu sasaṁdhyeṣu sasaṁdhyāṁśeṣu ca triṣu/ekāpāyena saṁyānti sahasrāṇi śatāni ca//) 12. 224. 20. 

  C.   Events: (1) Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) told Nārada that in the Tretāyuga, (first), he will be born as Rāma in the family of the Bhṛgus and will destroy the Kṣatriyas; and, (next), when the junction of the Tretā and the Dvāpara will have arrived he will be born as Rāma, son of Daśaratha, to be the king of the world (tretāyuge bhaviṣyāmi rāmo bhṛgukulodvahaḥ/kṣatraṁ cotsādayiṣyāmi…//saṁdhau tu samanuprāpte tretāyāṁ dvāparasya ca/rāmo dāśarthir bhūtvā bhaviṣyāmi jagatpatiḥ//) 12. 326. 77-78; 1. 2. 3; (2) A being without bodily form informed from the sky (12. 323. 46) Ekata, Dvita and Trita that when the Kṛtayuga had passed and the Tretāyuga of the 7th manvantara presided over by Manu Vaivasvata will have arrived they will work as helpers of gods for achieving a great purpose (vaivasvate 'ntare viprāḥ prāpte tretāyuge tataḥ/ surāṇāṁ kāryasiddhyarthaṁ sahāyā vai bhaviṣyatha) 12. 323. 51; (cf. 12. 326. 7980); (3) Vyāsa told Yudhiṣṭhira that Karaṁdhama's son (Avikṣit) was born at the commencement of the Tretāyuga--he was glorious, not inferior to Indra, and invincible even by the gods 14. 4. 17; (4) Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that formerly at the junction of the Tretā and the Dvāpara, a terrible drought, lasting for twelve years, occurred due to the working of the fate (daivavidhikramāt) 12. 139. 13; when the Tretā was about to end and the Dvāpara was about to set in and when the end of the eon was at hand Indra did not release rain (yugānte paryupasthite/tretānirmokṣasamaye dvāparapratipādane//na vavarṣa sahasrākṣaḥ) 12. 139. 14-15. 

  D.   Nārāyaṇa-Kṛṣṇa and Tretā: Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) told Mārkaṇḍeya that his colour in the Tretāyuga was yellow (pītas tretāyuge mama) 3. 187. 31; but according to Hanūmant, Acyuta was red in the Tretā (raktatāṁ yāti cācyutaḥ) 3. 148. 23; Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that Kṛṣṇa conformed to jñāna in the Tretā (tretākāle jñānam anuprapannaḥ) 13. 143. 9 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 158. 10: jñānam akartavyakoṭer api upasthānāt tretāyāṁ viveka āsīt). 

  E.   King and Tretā: When the king observes daṇḍanīti only in three parts and leaves out the fourth, the Tretāyuga sets in; the place of the fourth part is then made up by what is inauspicious and this part gets associated with the other three, hence the earth has to be ploughed for the growth of the plants (daṇḍanītyā yadā rājā trīn aṁśān anuvartate/caturtham aṁśam utsṛjya tadā tretā pravartate//aśubhasya caturthāṁśas trīn aṁśān anuvartate/kṛṣṭapacyaiva pṛthivī bhavantyoṣadhyas tathā//) 12. 70. 14-15; (pādonenāpi dharmeṇa gacchet tretāyuge tathā) 12. 259. 32; a king is the cause of the Tretā (as also of the other three Yugas) (tretāyāḥ…/…rājā bhavati kāraṇam) 5. 130. 16 = 12. 70. 25; (also cf. rājā kālasya kāraṇam 12. 70. 6 = 5. 130. 15); Tretā, like the other three Yugas, depends on the conduct of the king and hence the king is called a Yuga (rājavṛttāni sarvāṇi rājaiva yugam ucyate) 12. 92. 6; (rājamūlāni sarvāṇi) 12. 139. 10; a king obtains heaven, but not endlessly, because he introduces Tretā (tretāyāḥ karaṇād rājā svargaṁ nātyantam aśnute) 5. 130. 17 = 12. 70. 26; description of the people in the Tretā in the absence of daṇḍanīti 12. 65. 24-27; 

  F.   Tretā and dharma: In the Tretāyuga Dharma loses one of its four feet (tatra (i. e. tretāyuge) pādacaturtho vai dharmasya na bhaviṣyati) 12. 327. 74; (pādena hrasate dharmaḥ) 3. 148. 22-23; in the Tretā, Dharma is established in three parts and the remaining one part is affected by adharma (adharmapādaviddhas tu tribhir aṁśaiḥ pratiṣṭhitaḥ/tretāyām) 3. 188. 11; also of 12. 259. 32; in the Tretā and the other two following Yugas the dharma is displaced from tradition successively by one quarter and the adharma is on increase due to thefts, falsehood and deceit (itareṣv (i. e. yugeṣu) āgamād dharmaḥ pādaśas tv avaropyate/caurikānṛtamāyābhir adharmaś copacīyate) 12. 224. 23; the dharmas in the Tretā were different from those in the Kṛta 12. 224. 26 = 12. 252. 8; jñāna was considered to be the best dharma for the Tretā (tretāyāṁ jñānam uttamam) 12. 224. 27; Hanūmant told Bhīma that times in the different Yugas were different 3. 148. 6; Vyāsa told his son Śuka that he had heard that the study of the Vedas decreased in every following Yuga and so also the benefit derived by people from the Veda (vedavādāś cānuyugaṁ hrasantīti ca naḥ śrutam/…vedasyaiva ca yat phalam) 12. 224. 25; the Sātvata dharma, which flourished in the Kṛtayuga of the fourth birth of Brahman (12. 336. 25), disappeared when the Tretā returned (tataḥ so 'ntardadhe bhūyaḥ prāpte tretāyuge punaḥ) 12. 336. 35; but in the seventh birth of Brahman (12. 336. 44) the same Sātvata dharma was taught by Vivasvān to Manu 12. 326. 47; according to Mārkaṇḍeya, however, the dharma for the Kṛta, the Tretā and the Dvāpara was the same 3. 189. 13. 

  G.   Tretā and the sacrifice: There were no sacrifices in the Kṛtayuga, but they all, very strong, collected together appeared in the Tretā and became controllers of those that move (living beings) and those that do not (non-living beings) (tretāyuge vidhis tv eṣāṁ yajñānāṁ na kṛte yuge…tretāyāṁ tu samastās te prādurāsan mahābalāḥ/saṁyantāraḥ sthāvarāṇāṁ jaṅgamānāṁ ca sarvaśaḥ// tretāyāṁ saṁhatā hy ete yajñāḥ…) 12. 224. 62, 64, 65 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 232. 34: tretāyāṁ dharme nṛṇāṁ svataḥ pravṛttyabhāvāt tatra saṁyantāro dharmaśāstāro vedāś ca saṁhatā yajñādyanuṣṭhāpanāya sannaddhā āsan); Bhagavān (Nārāyana) told the gods that the three Vedas will rule the Tretāyuga and then the animals, consecrated for the sacrifice, will be killed (tatas tretāyugaṁ nāma trayī yatra bhaviṣyati/prokṣitā yatra paśava vadhaṁ prāpsyanti vai makhe/) 12. 327. 74; (tretām api nibodha tvam yasmin satraṁ pravartate) 3. 148. 22; (tato yajñāḥ pravartante dharmāś ca vividhāḥ kriyāḥ/ tretāyāṁ bhāvasaṁkalpāḥ kriyādānaphalodayāḥ//) 3. 148. 24 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 149. 23: satraṁ yajñakriyā rajomiśratvāt; on 3. 149. 25: bhāvasaṁkalpāḥ bhāvo bhāvanā kriyā aham anena karmaṇā idaṁ phalaṁ anena prakāreṇa kariṣyāmīty evaṁrūpā tadviṣaya eva saṁkalpo yeṣām); Vyāsa told Śuka that at the commencement of the Tretā the Vedas and the sacrifices are complete in form (tretādau sakalā vedā yajñā varṇāśrāmās tathā) 12. 230. 14; (also cf. Maheśvara (Viṣṇu) recommending the performance of sacrifices for the benefit of gods, and the gods, on their part, sustaining the worlds in the Yugas (not named) other than the Kṛta 12. 327. 53-60). 

  H.   Nature of the Tretāyuga: Hanūmant told Bhīma that the times in the Tretā were different from those in the Kṛta (anyaḥ kṛtayuge kālas tretāyāṁ dvāpare 'paraḥ) 3. 148. 6; Hanūmant then described to Bhīma the condition of the world in the Tretāyuga 3. 148. 22-25 (men are truthful (satyapravaṛttāś ca narāḥ), they do not deviate from the path of dharma, are given to the practice of austerities and to giving gifts); the Tretāyuga also described by Saṁjaya to Dhṛtarāṣṭra (Kṣatriyas are long-lived, they are great warriors, excellent archers in war, brave and emperors) 6. 11. 10 (jāyante kṣatriyāḥ śūrās tretāyāṁ cakravartinaḥ); according to Mārkaṇḍeya the condition of dharma in the Tretā is not different from the one in the Kṛta described by him (eṣa dharmaḥ kṛtayuge treāyām) 3. 189 13; the ascetics in the Tretā, who are steady in the sattva guṇa, have no doubt whatever whether puruṣa, daiva or svabhāva is the cause of a man's success in his activities; they see no distinction, as same people for want of judgement do, between them (pauruṣaṁ kāraṇaṁ kecid āhuḥ karmasu mānavāḥ/daviam eke praśaṁsanti svabhāvaṁ cāpare janāḥ//… trayam etat pṛthagbhūtam avivekaṁ tu kecana/…karmasthā viṣamaṁ brūyuḥ sattvasthāḥ samadarśinaḥ// tretāyāṁ… tapasvinaḥ…) 12. 230. 4, 6-7; in the Tretā, as in the Kṛta, people could get progeny by mere thought and did not have to cohabit for this purpose (tatra tretāyuge kāle saṁkalpāj jāyate prajā/na hy abhūt maithuno dharmas teṣām api narādhipa//) 12. 200. 36; evil tribes like the Talavaras, the Andhrakas and others in the south and the Yaunas (Yavanas), the Kāmbojas and others in the north, unlike in the Kṛtayuga, begin to roam about on the surface of the earth from the Tretāyuga onwards (naite kṛtayuge tāta caranti pṛthivīm imām/ tretāprabhṛti vartante te janā bharatarṣabha//) 12. 200. 42. 

  I.   Span of life: Vyāsa told Śuka that people in each succeeding Yuga lived a quarter years less than those in the Kṛtayuga who lived for four hundred years, i. e. in the Tretā they lived for three hundred years (caturvarṣaśatāyuṣaḥ/kṛte tretādiṣv eteṣāṁ pādaśo hrasate vayaḥ) 12. 224. 24; Vyāsa had heard that life gradually decreased in each successive Yuga (anuyugaṁ hrasantīti ca naḥ śrutam/āyūṁṣi) 12. 224. 25; the same thing was told by Mārkaṇḍeya to Yudhiṣṭhira (āyur vīryam atho buddhir balaṁ tejaś ca pāṇḍava/manuṣyāṇām anuyugaṁ hrasatīti nibodha me) 3. 188. 13; however, Saṁjaya, told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that people lived for three thousand years in the Tretā (āyuḥsaṁkhyā…saṁkhyātā rājasattama/tathā trīṇi sahasrāṇi tretāyāṁ manujādhipa//) 6. 11. 5-6 (apparently, in Saṁjaya's narration, there is cunfusion between the duration of the Tretāyuga (cf. section 

  B.   above) and the life expectancy of the people in this Yuga). 

  J.   Simile: The region where the river Narmadā (f.) passes along the Vaiḍūrya mountain (m.) is compared with the conjunction of the Tretā (f.) and the Dvāpara (m) (vaiḍūryaparvataṁ dṛṣṭvā narmadām avatīrya ca/sandhir eṣa naraśreṣṭha tretāyā dvāparasya ca//) 3. 121. 18-19. 

  K.   Name of Sūrya: Tretā appears as the 47th name among the hundred and eight names of Sūrya taught by Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22. [The words Kṛta, Tretā and Dvāpara occurring in 5. 140. 715 are wrongly interpreted by Nī. (Bom. Ed. 5. 142. 7-15) as names of the three Yugas and not as the names of the throws of dice in a dice-game].

  C.   Possible explanation of the name: 

  A.   famous big tree named Śāka stood in its middle (that was why probably the Dvīpa was so called) (…vikhyātas tasya madhye mahādrumaḥ//śāko nāma mahārāja tasya dvīpasya madhyagaḥ/) 6. 12. 25-26.

  C.   Characteristics: (1) Sarasvatī appears and disappears again at various places (dṛśyādṛśyā ca bhavati tatra tatra sarasvatī) 6. 7. 47; the trees growing on the banks of Sarasvatī are (sarasvatītīraruhaiḥ…śobhitam): Badara, Iṅguda, Kāśmarya, Plakṣa, Aśvattha, Vibhītaka, Panasa, Palāśa, Karīra, Pīlu, Bandhana, Syandana, Bilva, Āmrātaka, and Pārijāta; there are also on its bank forests of Parūṣaka (parūṣakavanaiś caiva) and groves of Atimuktaka (atimuktakaṣaṇḍaiś ca) 9. 36. 58-60; auspicious Śāla forests grow on its banks (śiveṣu/sarasvatīśālavaneṣu teṣu) 3. 26. 1; the big Mahāśaṅkha tree is on its bank 9. 36. 20; the forests on its bank are inhabited by the righteous who have controlled their self and who wear bark garments and have matted hair and also by hosts of perfected sages (bhogavatīm upetya dhṛtātmanāṁ cīrajaṭādharāṇām tasmin vane dharmabhṛtāṁ nivāse/dadarśa siddharṣigaṇān anekān) 3. 25. 20; cf. 3. 26. 1; (Nī. on Bom.

  D.   Holiness: (1) Vaiśaṁpāyana told Janamejaya the holiness of the Tīrthavaṁśa of Sarasvatī (here in particular of the Aujasatīrtha 9. 45. 92) 9. 45. 88; Sarasvatī and the tīrthas on Sarasvatī are holier than Kurukṣetra (puṇyam āhuḥ kurukṣetraṁ kurukṣetrāt sarasvatīm/sarasvatyāś ca tīrthāni) 3. 81. 125; by the favour of sage Dadhīca, Sarasvatī was to be at all times holiest among the other holy rivers (puṇyābhyaś ca saridbhyas tvaṁ sadā puṇyatamā śubhe/bhaviṣyasi mahābhāge matprasādāt sarasvati) 9. 50. 23; (9. 53. 35); (2) By bathing in the river Sarasvatī one washes off one's sins (dhūtapāpmā bhaviṣyasi) 3. 129. 20; by bathing in Sarasvatī one rides in a vimāna (sarasvatyām upaspṛśya vimānastho virājate) 3. 82. 139; by visiting Sarasvatī people have gone to heaven; those who have done evil acts if they visit Sarasvatī they never grieve in this or the other world (sarasvatīṁ prāpya janāḥ suduṣkṛtāḥ/sadā na śocanti paratra ceha ca//) 9. 53. 34-35; according to the Gāthās sung by Yayāti (12. 148. 8) if one bathes and drinks water at Pṛthūdaka on Sarasvatī one does not have to worry about death in near future (naiva śvomaraṇaṁ tapet) 12. 148. 10; this was also told by Ruṣaṅgu to his sons 9. 38. 29; by visiting Sarasvatī and by satisfying there gods and manes one rejoices undoubtedly in the worlds of Sarasvatī (sārasvateṣu lokeṣu modate nātra saṁśayaḥ) 3. 82. 59; by bathing at the tīrtha on Sarasvatī gods, Gandharvas, Apsarases, Dvaipāyana, Śuka, Kṛṣṇa, Yakṣas and many others became perfected in Yoga (yogasiddhāḥ) 9. 48. 18-20; one should live on Sarasvatī for a month 3. 81. 3; (3) By bathing at the confluence of Gaṅgā and Sarasvatī one gets the fruit of an Aśvamedha and goes to heaven 3. 82. 34; by visiting the place where Sarasvatī meets the ocean (sarasvatyāḥ sāgarasya ca saṁgame) one gets the fruit of gifting a thousand cows and shining always with lustre like that of fire he is glorified in heaven (svargaloke mahīyate/dīpyamāno 'gnivan nityaṁ prabhayā); living there for three nights one should satisfy manes and gods; he thereby shines like the moon (prabhāsate yathā somaḥ…) and gets the reward of an Aśvamedha 3. 80. 79-80; at the confluence of Sarasvatī (the other river is not named) people worship Janārdana; Brahmā and other gods, as well as sages and Siddhas and Cāraṇas, visit it on the fourteenth day of the bright half of Caitra 3. 80, 130; it is recommended that one should live at Kurukṣetra on Sarasvatī for a month (tatra (kurukṣetre) sarasvatyāṁ māsaṁ vaset) 3. 81. 3; (4) There are many tīrthas on Sarasvatī 5. 154. 33; 9. 34. 33; all these tīrthas are holy 3. 81. 125; their holiness described in the Śalyaparvan (śalyaparvaṇi…sarasvatyāś ca tīrthānāṁ puṇyatā parikīrtitā) 1. 2. 174-175; these tīrthas are: Śaśayāna 3. 80. 120-121; a tīrtha sacred to Arantuka, chief of Yakṣas 3. 81. 42; Śrīkuñja 3. 81. 91; Naimiṣakuñja 3. 81. 92; Devītīrtha at the confluence of Sarasvatī and Aruṇā 3. 81. 131; Vinaśana 3. 130. 3; Camasodbheda 3. 130. 5; Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṁpāyana to tell him the origin, the merits, the reward of visiting them, and how one achieves successful completion of visiting the tīrthas on Sarasvatī (sārasvatānāṁ tīrthānāṁ guṇotpattiṁ vadasva me/phalaṁ ca dvipadāṁ śreṣṭha karmanirvṛttim eva ca// 9. 34. 33: Nī. on Bom. Ed. 9. 35. 38: karmanirvṛttiṁ tīrthayātrāvidhisiddhim); Vaiśaṁpāyana's account includes Prabhāsa 9. 34. 36; Camasodbheda 9. 34. 78; Subhūmika 9. 36. 3; Gargasrotas 9. 36. 14, 16; Śaṅkhatīrtha 9. 36. 24; Auśanasa 9. 38. 16, also called Kapālamocana 9. 38. 20; Pṛthūdaka 9. 38. 25-26; a tīrtha not named 9. 38. 33; 9. 39. 6, 10, 23, 30; (5) The region deserted by Sarasvatī would be bereft of holiness (apuṇya eṣa bhavatu deśaś tyaktas tvayā śubhe) 13. 139. 26; cows act like Sarasvatīs (pl.) in delivering persons from the remainder of their actions (?), in freeing them from the body and in the obtainment of bliss (śeṣotsarge karmabhir dehamokṣe sarasvatyaḥ śreyasi saṁpravṛttāḥ) 13. 75. 12 (But Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 76. 12: (gāvaḥ) kṣayarogādinivṛttau dehamokṣe ca karmabhiḥ pañcagavyādibhiḥ sevitāḥ satyaḥ sarasvatyo nadya iva śreyase saṁpravṛttāḥ); one should live on the rivers Sarasvatī and Dṛṣadvatī worshipping them, doing one's studies and bathing in all places (sarasvatīdṛṣadvatyau sevamāno 'nusaṁcareḥ/svādhyāyaśīlaḥ sthāneṣu sarveṣu samupaspṛśeḥ) 12. 148. 12; but sage Parāśara told to king Janaka that, more than with waters of the rivers, one should bathe one's body with austerities (i. e. one should practise austerities) at all holy places like Sarasvatī, Naimiṣa, Puṣkara and the rest (adbhyo bhūyaḥ plāvyaṁ tapasā vai śarīram/sarasvatīnaimiṣapuṣkareṣu ye cāpy anye puṇyadeśāḥ pṛthivyām) 12. 286. 37; (6) Sarasvatī suited for sacrifices: (i) The fire-altar of Prajāpati was on holy Sarasvatī (sarasvatīm imāṁ puṇyāṁ paśya…vedī prajāpater eṣā) 3. 129. 20, 22; (ii) Many sages, divine sages, and royal sages had offered sacrifices on Sarasvatī (iha sārasvatair yajñair iṣṭavantaḥ surarṣayaḥ/ṛṣayaś caiva kaunteya tathā rājarṣayo 'pi ca) 3. 129. 21; (iii) Formerly Vālakhilya sages offered sacrifices on Ṣarasvatī 3. 88. 9; (iv) Sarasvatī is listed by Mārkaṇḍeya among the rivers which are called mothers of the sacrificial hearths (i. e. on the banks of which sacrifices were performed) 3. 212. 21 (for citation and Nī. see  Kapilā ); (7) Sarasvatī also mentioned among the holy places by visiting which the high-souled ones who have observed vows (mahātmāno dhṛtavratāḥ) assume heavenly form and, becoming auspicious, wearing heavenly garlands and rich in holy perfume, they go to the world of cows (? te tatra modanti gavāṁ vimāne 13. 105. 44) 13. 105. 48 (for citation see  Karatoyinī ); (8) According to Tulādhāra, however, all rivers are equal in point of holiness to Sarasvatī (sarvā nadyaḥ sarasvatyaḥ) 12. 255. 39.

Past and Mythological events: (1) King Matināra performed a sacrificial session lasting for twelve years on the bank of Sarasvatī; after the satra was over, Sarasvatī chose Matināra for her husband; a son was born to Sarasvatī, Taṁsu by name; this is recorded in a stanza describing lineage (atrānuvaṁśo bhavati/taṁsuṁ sarasvatī putraṁ matinārād ajījanat) 1. 90. 25-28); (2) Describing past events in Kṛṣṇa's life Arjuna said that in a satra lasting for twelve years on Sarasvatī Kṛṣṇa discarded his upper garment, became thin, having stretched veins (apakṛṣṭottarāsaṅgaḥ kṛśo dhamanisaṁtataḥ/āsīḥ kṛṣṇa sarasvatyāṁ satre dvādaśavārṣike//) 3. 13, 13 (Nī. on 3. 12. 14; apakṛṣṭottarāsaṅgaḥ tyaktottarīyavastraḥ); (3) Sarasvatī is one of the seven forms assumed by Gaṅgā on the mountain Hiraṇyaśṛṅga (6. 7. 40); these forms became famous as seven Gaṅgās in the three worlds 6. 7. 44-45, 47; (4) Trita fell down at night in a well which was not far away from Sarasvatī 9. 35. 24-25; when Trita requested gods to rescue him from the well, Sarasvatī, full of waves, leapt up and threw Trita out of the well (tatra cormimatī rājann utpapāta sarasvatī/tayotkṣiptas tritas tasthau) 9. 35, 46; (5) Sarasvatī, in bygone days, disappeared due to her hatred for Śūdras and Ābhīras; the place where she disappeared was named by sages Vinaśana tīrtha (śūdrābhīrān prati dveṣād yatra naṣṭā sarasvatī…tasmāt tad ṛṣayo nityaṁ prāhur vinaśaneti ha//) 9. 36. 1-2; (6) Sarasvatī, flowing towards the east, returned from a certain tīrtha to the west out of her regard for the sages living in the Naimiṣa forest; formerly, in the Kṛta age, many sages from the Naimiṣa forest, after completing satra of twelve years, flocked to Sarasvatī for pilgrimage (tīrthakāraṇāt); on account of their large numbers the tīrthas on the south bank of Sarasvatī appeared like cities (ṛṣīṇāṁ bahulatvāt tu sarasvatyā viśāṁ pate/tīrthāni nagarāyante kūle vai dakṣiṇe tadā//); these sages resorted to the bank of Sarasvatī as far as the Samantapañcaka on account of their love for tīrthas (tīrthalobhāt); due to the fires of their agnīhotras the river shone (aśobhata saricchreṣṭhā); the sages, dwelling near Sarasvatī, beautified the river as do gods the Ganges (śobhayantaḥ saricchreṣṭhām gaṅgām iva divaukasaḥ); when other sages arrived there to perform a satra they found no place in Kurukṣetra; then Sarasvatī showed herself to the despondent sages (tatas tam ṛṣisaṁghātaṁ nirāśaṁ cintayānvitam/darśayām āsa rājendra teṣām arthe sarasvatī); the river created for them many bowers, returned (tataḥ kuñjān bahūn kṛtvā saṁnivṛttā saridvarā), and again flowed towards the west thinking “I shall not render the arrival of the sages futile; now I shall go my way”; this is a great wonder that the river performed (bhūyaḥ pratīcyabhimukhī susrāva saritāṁ varā//amoghā gamanaṁ (amoghāgamanam ?) kṛtvā teṣāṁ bhūyo vrajāmy aham/ity adbhutaṁ mahac cakre tato rājan mahānadī) 9. 36. 35-53; (7) When Maṅkaṇaka, who was observing chastity (kaumārabrahmacāriṇaḥ) saw by chance a woman taking bath in Sarasvatī his seed fell into water; when it was collected in a jar by the sage, the seed got divided into seven parts; from it were born seven seers, from whom sprang the Maruts (tatrarṣayaḥ sapta jātā jajñire marutāṁ gaṇāḥ/…evam ete samutpannā marutāṁ janayiṣṇavaḥ) 9. 37. 29-32 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 9. 38. 37 (eteṣāṁ tapasā maruto 'dityām utpannā iti kalpāntaraviṣayo 'yam arthaḥ); (8) The Brāhmaṇa Ruṣaṅgu, when he decided to give up his body in old age, asked his sons to carry him to Pṛthūdaka, a tīrtha on Sarasvatī; when he was carried to the river by his sons, he took bath there (āplutaḥ) and, knowing the qualities of the tīrtha, told his sons: “one who gives up his body on the northern bank of Sarasvatī will not have to worry about iminent death” (nainaṁ śvomaraṇaṁ tapet) 9. 38. 24-29, (9) Baka Dālbhya, when insulted by Dhṛtarāṣṭra, son of Vicitravīrya (9. 40. 1; probably different from the son of Ambikā and the father of the Kauravas), kindled fire at a desolate tīrtha on Sarasvatī (avakīrṇe sarasvatyās tīrthe prajvālya pāvakam 9. 40. 12; Nī., however, who reads avākīrṇam takes it as the name of a tīrtha: avākīrṇaṁ nāma dālbhyasevitaṁ tīrthaṁ jagāma Bom. Ed. 9. 41. 1) and started giving offerings of flesh of dead animals; as a result the kingdom of Dhṛtarāṣṭra began to waste away; he was therefore advised to propitiate Baka in a bower in the water of Sarasvatī (apāṁ kuñje sarasvatyās taṁ prasādaya pārthiva) and request Baka to forgive him for his fault 9. 40. 10-21; (also see No. 27 below); (10) For the sacrifice of Yayāti, son of Nahuṣa, Sarasvatī brought in her currents clarified butter and milk (ghṛtaṁ payaś ca susrāva); in that sacrifice, Sarasvatī fulfilled the wishes of Brāhmaṇas by producing many juices (?) in accordance with their wishes (yatra yatra hi yo vipro yān yān kāmān abhīpsati/ tatra tatra saricchreṣṭhā sasarja subahūn rasān) 9. 40. 30, 33; (11) Viśvāmitra practised severe austerities on an excellent tīrtha (not named) of Sarasvatī and became a Brāhmaṇa 9. 39. 23, 28-29; the āśrama of Vasiṣṭha was at Sthāṇutīrtha on the eastern bank of Sarasvatī and that of Viśvāmitra on the western bank; at the tīrtha Vasiṣṭhāpavāha, Viśvāmitra was able to displace Vasiṣṭha with the help of severe austerities (vasiṣṭhaṁ cālayām āsa tapasogreṇa) 9. 41. 4, 8; Viśvāmitra wanted Sarasvatī to bring Vasiṣṭha to him swiftly so that he could kill him (Vasiṣṭha); Viśvāmitra therefore thought of Sarasvatī; she appeared before him, trembling with fear, and asked him what she might do for him; Viśvāmitra told the river what he wanted her to do; hearing that Sarasvatī was pained; she just stood there all the while shaking with fear; Viśvāmitra asked her again to bring Vasiṣṭha quickly to him; she was worried what to do as she was afraid of the curses of both the sages; she went to Vasiṣṭha and informed him what Viśvāmitra's desire was; Vasiṣṭha saw her pale and lean and told her to carry him to Viśvāmitra and save herself from the latter's curse; hearing that Sarasvatī reflected on what she might do which would turn out beneficial to Vasiṣṭha as he had been merciful to her; when she saw on the other bank Viśvāmitra engaged in giving offerings she thought that to be the right moment to act swiftly (sarasvaty abhyacintayat/idam antaram ity eva 9. 41. 26-27); she washed away a part of her bank on the side of Vasiṣṭha so that he was carried on her current to the āśrama of Viśvāmitra; while he was being thus carried Vasiṣṭha praised Sarasvatī (Sarasvatī's praise 9. 41. 29-31); Sarasvatī informed Viśvāmitra that she had brought Vasiṣṭha; Viśvāmitra began to look for a weapon to kill Vasiṣṭha; being afraid of the sin of killing a Brāhmaṇa Sarasvatī carried Vasiṣṭha back to the eastern bank (brahmahatyābhayān nadī/apovāha vasiṣṭhaṁ tu prācīṁ diśam atandritā 9. 41. 34); she thus did what both the sages asked her to do, but Viśvāmitra was deceived; enraged, he cursed the river to flow with blood; as a result Sarasvatī flew with water mixed with blood for a year; the sages, gods, Gandharvas and Apsarases were excessively pained to see Sarasvatī in that condition; this is how the tīrtha Vasiṣṭhāpavāha came into existance 9. 41. 11-39; when Sarasvatī carried blood with water in her current, Rākṣasas came there and were happy to drink blood from the river water; once, some sages, while visiting the tīrthas, came to Vasiṣṭhāpavāha they saw the Rākṣasas drinking blood from the river; they decided to do something to save the river; they invited Sarasvatī and found out from her the cause of the disturbed condition of the tīrtha (kāraṇaṁ brūhi kalyāṇi kimarthaṁ te hrado hy ayam/evam ākulatāṁ yātaḥ 9. 42. 9); on hearing the cause, they decided to free the river from the curse; by their mere word Sarasvatī returned to her normal condition and her water was as placid as before (teṣāṁ tu vacanād eva prakṛtisthā sarasvatī/prasannasalilā jajñe yathā pūrvam tathaiva hi 9. 42. 13); the excellent river shone as before; since the river water was normal again the Rākṣasas were afflicted by hunger and they requested the sages to relieve them from that condition; the sages praised the river and urged her to relieve the Rākṣasas from their condition; knowing what the sages wanted Sarasvatī brought to her current the river Aruṇā (aruṇām ānayām āsa svāṁ tanum); bathing in that river the Rākṣasas abandoned their bodies and went to heaven 9. 42. 1-25; (12) While Dadhīca was giving offerings to gods on the bank of Sarasvatī (tasya tarpayato devān sarasvatyām 9. 50. 8), the Apsaras Alambusā, sent by Indra to disturb the austerities of Dadhīca, approached him; seeing her divine form the seed of Dadhīca spilled into water of Sarasvatī; the river held it in her womb as she desired to have a son and also because the seed might not be wasted (kukṣau cāpy adadhat… tad retaḥ…putrahetor mahānadī 9. 50. 10; na vināśam idaṁ gacchet tvatteja iti niścayāt 9. 50. 14); when Sarasvatī delivered the child at proper time she took him to Dadhīca; seeing Dadhīca seated in the assembly of sages she handed over the child to him saying it was his son whom she bore out of her devotion to the sage (brahmarṣe tava putro 'yaṁ tvadbhaktyā dhārito mayā 9. 50. 12); Dadhīca accepted the child and was very much delighted; he then gave the following boon to Sarasvatī: “all gods, manes, Gandharvas and Apsarases will be satisfied when they receive offerings of your water (tṛptiṁ yāsyanti subhage tarpyamāṇās tavāmbhasā 9. 50. 17); the sage then praised the great river (9. 50. 19-20); he declared that this her son will be known as Sārasvata after the mother's name (tavaiva nāmnā prathitaḥ putras te lokabhāvanaḥ 9. 50. 21); he also declared that by his grace Sarasvatī would be the holiest of all holy rivers (puṇyābhyaś ca saridbhyas tvaṁ sadā puṇyatamā śubhe/ bhaviṣyasi mahābhāge matprasādāt sarasvati 9. 50. 23); when praised by the sage and having received a boon from him Sarasvatī went away taking her son with her 9. 50. 5-24; (13) Once there was drought lasting for twelve years; when Sārasvata, like other people, wanted to leave the place and go elsewhere in search of food, Sarasvatī told him not to leave the place; she assured him to provide food to him in the form of excellent fish; Sārasvata therefore lived there; he ate the food offered by the river and preserved the Vedas 9. 50. 36-38; (14) Bharata, son of Duḥṣyanta and Śakuntalā, bound twenty horses for sacrifice on the bank of Sarasvatī (sarasvatīṁ viṁśatiṁ ca) 12. 29. 41; (15) Gārgya satisfied Śiva by offering a mental sacrifice on the bank of Sarasvatī (sarsvatyās taṭe tuṣṭo manoyajñena pāṇḍava); Śiva then gave him wonderful knowledge of time (kālajñānaṁ mamādbhutam), a thousand sons, equal to Gārgya, versed in the exposition of Brahman (tulyaṁ mama sahasraṁ tu sutānāṁ brahmavādinām), and very long life to him and to his sons 13. 18. 25-26; (16) Nahuṣa invited Agastya, who was then on the bank of Sarasvatī, to come to him and draw his carriage (vāhanāyājuhāva saḥ/drutaṁ sarasvatīkūlāt) 13. 103. 12; (17) Utathya, angered at the abduction of his wife by Varuṇa, began to drink up water everywhere, compelled the ocean to recede and asked Sarasvatī: “Be invisible in a desert land; when deserted by you let the land be unholy” (adṛśyā gaccha bhīru tvaṁ sarasvati maruṁ prati/apuṇya eṣa bhavatu deśas tyaktas tvayā śubhe) 13. 139. 25-26; (18) Sarasvatī was one of the rivers seen by Mārkaṇḍeya in the belly of the Bāla (3. 186. 83 = Nārāyaṇa 3. 187. 3) 3. 186. 96; (19) Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṁpāyana the origin of the Saptasārasvata tīrtha; Vaiśaṁpāyana then began the narration of a past event in which Sarasvatī, when invited for a sacrifice at different places, appeared there under different names 9. 37. 1, 3-4; (i) When Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) thought of Sarasvatī she first appeared as Suprabhā at Puṣkara to make the sacrifice of Pitāmaha on this earth highly fruitful (mahāphalaḥ); Sarasvatī thus showed her respect for Pitāmaha (pitāmahaṁ mānayantīm) 9. 37. 11-14; (ii) When Sarasvatī was thought of by the sages performing a satra at Naimiṣa forest she appeard there as Kāñcanākṣī to help the sages (sahāyārthaṁ mahātmanām); she was honoured by the sages (pūjitā) 9. 37. 15-18; (iii) When she appeared for the sacrifice of Gaya among the people of Gayā (gayeṣu), sages called her Viśālā 9. 37. 20; (iv) In the sacrifice of Auddālaki in the northern Kosalas when she was thought of by Auddālaka the river appeared there for him (ājagāma saricchreṭhā taṁ deśam ṛṣikāraṇāt) under the name Manohradā (Mānasahradā in 9. 37. 4) since she was carried there by the sages through the agency of their mind (sā hi tair manasā hṛtā); the river was honoured there by the sages (pūjyamānā munigaṇaiḥ) 9. 37. 21-23; (v) In the Ṛṣabhadvīpa the river appeared with the name Suveṇu 9. 37. 24; (vi) In the sacrifice of Kuru at Kurukṣetra. when invoked by Vasiṣṭha, the river Sarasvatī appeared with the name Oghavatī 9. 37. 24-25; (vii) In the sacrifice of Dakṣa at Gaṅgādvāra the river appeared as Vimalodā 9. 37. 26 (Vimalodakā 9. 37. 4); when Brahman offered a sacrifice again he called the river back on the Himavant mountain; the tīrtha where all the seven forms of the river got united became famous as Saptasārasvata 9. 37. 2628; (20) When the chariot of Śiva was got ready for his fight with Asuras fighting from the Tripuras the Mahānadīs became its hind parts (jaṅghās tasya mahānadīḥ) 8. 24. 69 (Sarasvatī could be one of these ‘big rivers’; but cf. the next); (21) Sarasvatī was the parirathya (?) of Śiva's chariot 8. 24. 75 (however, according to Nī. on Bom. Ed. 8. 34. 34, sarasvatī here means speech: parirathyā pracāramārgaḥ/ sarasvatī vāgdevīkalpitaḥ śabdamātraśarīra ity arthaḥ); (22) When Hari resorted to another body with the head of a horse for the rescue of the Vedas, Gaṅgā and Sarasvatī became his two eyebrows (gaṅgā sarasvatī puṇyā bhruvāv āstāṁ mahānadī) 12. 335. 46; (23) The gods, led by Brahman, took with them Skanda and went to Himavant and the river Sarasvatī for his consecration as the general of their army 9. 43. 50-52; they consecrated Skanda at Sthāṇutīrtha on Sarasvatī 9. 41. 6-7; gods consecrated Skanda as their general with the holy waters of Sarasvatī having heavenly waters (sarasvatībhiḥ puṇyābhir divyatoyābhir eva tu/abhyaṣiñcan kumāraṁ vai) 9. 44. 18-19; (24) Dakṣa told gods that the emaciated Soma (moon) would grow again after bathing in the excellent tīrtha on Sarasvatī (sarasvatyā vare tīrthe unmajjan śaśalakṣaṇaḥ/punar vardhiṣyate devāḥ); Soma then proceeded to the great tīrtha Prabāsa on Sarasvatī 9. 34. 67, 69; (25) Sthāṇu (Śiva) offered a sacrifice and honoured Sarasvatī and then established Sthāṇutīrtha on the river 9. 41. 8; (26) When Indra was pursued by the head of Namuci, Pitāmaha (Brahman) asked Indra to offer a sacrifice and to bathe in Aruṇā; Indra then offered a sacrifice in the Kuñja of Sarasvatī and bathed in Aruṇā (sarasvatyāḥ kuñje…iṣṭvā…aruṇāyām upāspṛśat) 9. 42. 34-35; (27) At the tīrtha (not named) situated near the āśrama of Baka Dālbhya on the river Sarasvatī (9. 39. 32; 9. 40. 1) Bṛhaspati gave offerings of flesh for the prosperity of gods and the decline of Asuras (asurāṇām abhāvāya bhāvāya ca divaukasām) 9. 40. 26-27; (28) Sarasvatī was one of the rivers whom Umā wanted to consult on strīdharma before expounding it to Śiva as these rivers were well-versed in it; Umā thereby wanted to honour the rivers; the rivers appointed Gaṅgā to speak on their behalf to Umā 13. 134. 13, 19-22, 25. 

  G.   Importance: (1) One of the rivers who wait upon Varuṇa in his Sabhā (upāsate mahātmānam) 2. 9. 19, 22; (2) Mentioned twice in the Daivata-Ṛṣi-Vaṁśa recited by Bhīṣma 13. 151. 14, 22, (2). 

  H.   Simile: Draupadī having five Pāṇḍavas as her husbands was very happy with them and they with Draupadī as is Sarasvatī with the Nāgas (babhūva paramaprītā nāgair iva sarasvatī) 1. 205. 3 (Nī. on 1. 213. 3: nāgair gajaiḥ; he, however, adds: sarasvatī bahusaroyuktā vanasthalī/sā hi gajair yuktānyaiś chettum aśakyā/tayā ca gajā balinaḥ/evaṁ te mitho vṛddhihetavaḥ).

Function: Sainya carried the yoke on the right side (while Sugrīva carried it on the left) 10. 13. 2 (however, Uttara compared the side-horse yoked on the left of his chariot with Sainya 4. 40. 20); often only these two, and not all the four, mentioned as yoked to Kṛṣṇa's chariot, especially if the chariot did not figure in the war-context, hence Kṛṣṇa's epithet sainyasugrīvavāhanaḥ 2. 2. 13; 5. 81. 58; 9. 61. 39. 

  C.   Mention on various occasions:  1.  Only the two, yoked to the chariot: (1) when the chariot was used by Arjuna to abduct Subhadrā (under the pretext of going out for hunting) 1. 212. 3; (2) when Kṛṣṇa's chariot was made ready for his departure for Dvārakā from Khāṇḍavaprastha 2. 2. 13; (3) when Kṛṣṇa marched out of Dvārakā to attack Śālva and his town Saubha 3. 21. 12; (4) when Kṛṣṇa started for Dvārakā after meeting the Pāṇḍavas in the forest 3. 23. 45; (5) when Kṛṣṇa came again to meet the Pāṇḍavas in the Kāmyaka forest 3. 180. 6; (6) when Kṛṣṇa left the Kauravas and went to meet Kuntī 5. 129. 22, (but all the four horses yoked when he left Hāstinapura 5. 135. 28-30); (7) when Kṛṣṇa went to pacify Gāndhārī after the death of Duryodhana 9. 61. 39; (8) when Kṛṣṇa (and Sātyaki) accompanied Yudhiṣṭhira when he entered Hāstinapura after the war 12. 38. 39;  2.  All the four, i. e. Sainya, Sugrīva, Meghapuṣpa and Balāhaka, yoked to the chariot mostly when the chariot figured in the context of the war: (1) when the chariot was to be kept ready for Kṛṣṇa's likely intervention in the war to kill the Kaurava heroes to enable Arjuna to fulfil his vow to kill Jayadratha before the sunset 7. 56. 35; (2) when the chariot was brought to Sātyaki when he lost his chariot while fighting with Karṇa 7. 122. 45; (3) when Kṛṣṇa followed Bhīma who had left in pursuit of Aśvatthāman 10. 13. 2; (4) when Kṛṣṇa left for Hāstinapura on his peace mission 5. 81. 19; 5. 81. 58-59 (here although only Sainya and Sugrīva are named all the four are intended, cf. te hayāḥ), and on his return journey 5. 135. 28-30; (5) when Kṛṣṇa went to meet Bhīṣma 12. 53. 21; 12. 46. 35 (here also although only Sainya and Sugrīva are named, all the four are intended, cf. varāśvaiḥ).

  The ascetic Mandapāla turned into a Śārṅgaka bird had four sons from the Śārṅgikā Jaritā; Mandapāla left them when they were still in the eggs, but their mother did not desert them; she reared them as birds (svavṛtyā 1. 220. 19) after they were born; they all were seers (ṛṣi), knowers of Brahman, full of lustre and strong; they were able speakers 1. 220. 17; 1. 224. 8, 10; 1. 225. 3; when the fire began to burn the Khāṇḍava forest Mandapāla praised Agni and secured a promise from him not to burn his young ones 1. 220. 5, 16-32; 1. 223. 22-23; 1. 224. 9; 1. 225. 1; Stambamitra's father expected him to practise austerities when he grew up 1. 221. 9; when the forest fire broke out the Śārṅgaka young ones had not developed wings and feet (abarhāś caraṇair hīnāḥ 1. 221. 4, 18); as the fire drew near they advised their mother to abandon them and fly to a safe place; she, on her part, advised them to creep into the hole of a mouse to save themselves from fire; they did not agree since they were afraid of the mouse; when the young ones were not prepared to enter the hole even when assured by their mother that the mouse was taken away by a falcon, she left them to their fate 1. 221. 1-21; 1. 222. 1-16; as the fire drew close the three younger Śārṅgaka birds entreated the eldest one, Jarṅāri, to do something to rescue them; on that occasion Stambamitra said to his brother: “The eldest is the protection, the eldest releases from difficulty; if the eldest does not know (what to do), what shall the younger one do ?” (1. 223. 4); when the young Śārṅgaka birds began to praise god fire in turns, Stambamitra, when his turn arrived, said: “Oh Agni, you are the only one, and this whole world stands in you; you hold the beings and you bear the world; you carry the oblation, and wise men worship you as one and as manifold; after creating these worlds, you digest them when time arrives; you are the source of this world and its mainstay; oh lord of the world, you digest the food eaten by the living beings” (1. 223. 12-15); when the fire subsided the mother of the Śarṅgaka birds returned to them 1. 224. 17; sage Mandapāla also was anxious about the safety of Stambamitra and the rest and he returned to them; he was not greeted by the children and they did not speak to him; he enquired who was the eldest, who the next, who the midle one and who the youngest; when be assured them that he had already secured their safety from god Fire they were reconciled to him; Mandapāla left the region of the Khāṇḍava forest and went elsewhere with his wife and children 1. 224. 6, 20-22; 1. 225. 1-4.

 previous_page p78       next_page p80Sthūṇākarṇa  : nt.: Name of a missile, apparently known to very few heroes.

  According to Nīlakaṇṭha, it is related to Śaṅkukarṇa, one of the incarnations of Rudra (sthūṇākarṇa iti śaṅkukarṇākhyo rudrāvatārabhedas taddaivatyam astram on 3. 167. 33 Bom. Ed.); it seems to have been a very important missile since it is mentioned along with the Pāśupata and the Brahmāstra 5. 47. 100; 5. 139. 31 (also Aindra); Arjuna, in his message sent through Saṁjaya, threatened to use Sthūṇākarṇa against the Kaurava warriors in the war 5. 47. 100; Karṇa, too, was sure that Arjuna would use Sthūṇākarṇa in the war with the employment of proper mantras on his arrow (mantrās tatra bhaviṣyanti prayuktāḥ savyasācinā) 5. 139. 31; but its use by Arjuna in the war is not recorded; on the other hand Karṇa himself, while inciting the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra who were attacking Yudhiṣṭhira to kill him, released Sthūṇākarṇa, along with Indrajāla and Pāśupata, to overpower Yudhiṣṭhira 8. 43. 20-21; outside the epic war, Arjuna used it against the Kirāta (Śiva) who swallowed it up 3. 163. 32; Arjuna used it also against the Gandharvas who had captured the Kauravas; the Gandharvas were tormented by the heat (dahyamānāḥ) of the arrows released by the use of the missile 3. 234. 17-18; Balarāma had released Sthūṇākarṇa missile to repulse a very powerful gadā hurled against him and Kṛṣṇa by Jarāsandha; the gadā, when met with force by the missile, fell on the earth tearing it open and the impact produced by it shook the mountains; the Rākṣasī Jarā (who had joined the two parts of the body of Jarāsandha) lay concealed under the ground; she, together with her sons and relatives, was killed due to the impact of the gadā and the Sthūṇākarṇa missile on the earth 7. 156. 10-14.

  Sage Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana (Vyāsa) once, while wandering, saw a worm (kīṭa 13. 118. 7) running speedily away on a cart-road; the sage asked the worm why he appeared so terrified, what was the source of his fear, and where he was going in haste; the worm replied that he had heard the sound of a big cart, as also the breathing of the bulls who were drawing heavy burden, and sound of men; such sounds could not be borne by worms; he was running away from danger to his life; death is painful and life is not easily obtained; when the sage told the worm that he should be happy to die since he was leading life in a lower species (tiryagyoni 13. 118. 14) where one did not understood sound, touch, taste, smell and did not get diverse enjoyments, the worm replied that a living being was attached to whatever life he was in and hence he was happy even in his present condition; as a worm, he got the enjoyments his body needed; men and animals have different enjoyments; the worm told Vyāsa that in his former life as a human being he was a wealthy Śūdra, but he was not devoted to Brāhmaṇas; he was cruel, living on usury, harsh in speech, cunning in behaviour, plunderer of all; he committed all sorts of cruel acts (13. 118. 19-24), remembering which he now repented; but he had respected his mother and honoured a good Brāhmaṇa with guest-worship; it was on that account that he did not lose his memory (of past birth); the worm felt that due to that virtuous act he could hope for happiness and asked Vyāsa what he was going to be 13. 118. 7-28; Vyāsa told the worm that it was due to his (Vyāsa's) favour that the worm was not stupefied; sage Vyāsa was able to save beings by merely looking at them (ahaṁ hi darśanād eva tārayāmi tapobalāt 13. 119. 2); Vyāsa knew that the worm was reduced to that condition due to his evil acts; but the worm would attain great religious merit if he considered himself as practising dharma (avāpsyasi paraṁ dharmaṁ dharmastho yadi manyase 13. 119. 3); the worm would attain that state which an excellent Brāhmaṇa (vipra) attained by worshipping Sun and Moon and by telling holy narratives; Vyāsa would lead the worm to that state of brahma which was desired by him; having got this assurance from Vyāsa the worm (stopped running away and) stood where he was; he went to see the sage when, after death, having passed through various births (13. 119. 9) he was born a Kṣatriya; as a prince he fell at the feet of the sage and described to him the comforts he enjoyed in his present condition (13. 119. 12-15); he acknowledged that it was due to the favour of the sage that he, having once been a worm, was now a prince; he asked Vyāsa what next he should do; the sage told him that his earlier sin was not destroyed; whatever good he had formerly done got him to see the sage; that merit led him to the birth of a Kṣatriya; now by offering his life on the battle-field for the sake of cows and Brāhmaṇas and by performing sacrifices (?ṛtūn 13. 119. 22) he could, having become brahman (brahmabhū aḥ ?), obtain enjoyments in heaven (13. 119. 1-23); the Kṣatriya then began to practise severe austerities; Vyāsa approached him and told him that as a Kṣatriya his duty was to protect beings; if he followed his dharma, he would become a Brāhmaṇa; the Kṣatriya did as told and after death became a Brāhmaṇa; Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana came to him again and told him not to be afflicted by anything; he would be in danger if he neglected dharma; hence he should practise the highest dharma (dharmalopād bhayaṁ te syāt tasmād dharmaṁ carottamam 13. 120. 10); the worm again acknowledged his debt to Vyāsa; he felt that his sin was destroyed since he had obtained prosperity rooted in dharma; the worm, who was then a Brāhmaṇa, marked the earth by the yūpas of sacrifices performed by him; he then reached the world of Brahman and obtained the eternal brahman by acting as advised by Vyāsa 13. 120. 1-14; this incident of the past (purāvṛtta) is reported in the form of a dialogue (samvāda) between Kīṭa and Dvaipāyana 13. 118. 6.

Effects: When employed, the missile released powerful arrows (? kṛśāśvatanayāḥ), as also sharp arrows which would fill the directions 7. 166. 38; it let loose many heavenly weapons (divyāni śastravarṣāṇi) and the employer (Aśvatthāman) shone with lustre 7. 166. 50; the arrows released from it would hit the enemies as desired by the employer (Aśvatthāman); it would release rocks at will and iron-tipped arrows which would put the enemy to flight 7. 166. 53-54; when Aśvatthāman produced the missile, thunderous winds carrying waterdrops blew in cloud-less sky, the earth shook, and the ocean was agitated; rivers started flowing in the opposite direction; peaks of mountains were shattered; sun became turbid (kaluṣa), and the gods, the demons, and the Gandharvas were frightened 7. 167. 1-5; arrows with shining tips appeared in thousands to cover the army of the enemy and fill the directions; (hot) iron balls (kārṣṇāyasamayā guḍāḥ) shining like celestial bodies, śataghnīs (‘hundred-killers’), fire-arms (? hutāśadāḥ), and disks with sharp ends (cakrāṇi kṣurāntāni), all these were produced by the Nārāyaṇāstra (7. 170. 16-19); as the Pāṇḍava warriors tried to resist the missile, it grew in strength 7. 170. 21; as a result, the Pāṇḍava army was burnt and destroyed 7. 170. 22-23; to combat it successfully Kṛṣṇa advised the warriors to lay down arms and get down from their chariots and mounts 7. 170. 38-42; when all followed his instruction, Bhīma wanted to resist the missile with arrows, mace, and the strength of his arms; as a consequence, the Nārāyaṇāstra grew in strength; since other warriors had laid down their arms the missile descended on Bhīma with all its strength 7. 170. 45-46, 50-51, 57-60; seeing Bhīma surrounded by the Nārāyaṇāstra, Arjuna tried to protect him from the missile by using Vāruṇāstra; since this was of no avail, Arjuna and Vāsudeva left from their chariot, ran to Bhīma, and entered through the cover of lustre produced by the astra; since they had no weapons, the astra did not affect them (and also because of the effect of the Vāruṇāstra and the prowess of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna); Bhīma was forced down by Nara (Arjuna) and Nārāyaṇa (Kṛṣṇa) from his chariot and forced to give up weapons; the Nārāyaṇāstra was then pacified; the quarters became clear and gentle winds blew; the birds and the animals felt assured 7. 171. 1, 3, 6, 10-14, 20-22; if Vāsudeva had not shown the way to combat the Nārāyaṇāstra it would have meant death for the enemy (of the Kauravas) 7. 171. 28; but the missile was rendered ineffective and the Pāṇḍavas freed from it 7. 171. 33; 8. 1. 42. 

  E.   The means to pacify the Nārāyaṇāstra: When released, the missile must kill the enemy and only then it would subside; the other ways of pacifying it were to run away from it, to lay down the arms, to beg for life, and ask refuge (vadhaḥ saṁkhye dravaś caiva śastrāṇāṁ ca visarjanam/ prayācanaṁ ca śatrūṇāṁ gamanaṁ śaraṇasya ca//ete praśamane yogā mahāstrasya parantapa) 7. 166. 48-49. 

  F.   Status: The Pāśupatāstra of Śiva rated superior to the Nārāyaṇāstra 13. 14. 127.

  A.   Recidence: Lived in a hole, having hundred outlets, at the foot of a banyan tree 12. 136. 21. 

  B.   Qualities: He was very wise, intelligent, thoughtful, versed in scriptures, knew how things shaped themselves, and the proper time for conciliation and feud (prājña 12. 136. 191; prajñāvant 12. 136. 192; mahāprājña 12. 136. 21, 26. 100; matimant 12. 136. 87; buddhisaṁmata and śāstravid 12. 136. 100; śāstrārthatattvajña 12. 136. 191; dharmatattvajña 12. 136. 181; paramārthajña 12. 136. 128; arthagatitattvajña and sandhivigrahakālavid 12. 136. 47); according to the cat Lomaśa Palita was Uśanas himself in intelligence 12. 136. 127. 

  C.   Palita-Lomaśa Episode: Once when the cat Lomaśa who lived on the branches of the same banyan tree was caught in the trap (unmātha) fixed by a Cāṇḍāla, Palita moved about fearlessly; he got a piece of flesh and as he was eating it after taking it on the top of the trap and smiling mentally (manasā hasan 12. 136. 28) at his enemy, trapped below, Palita saw his second enemy, a mongoose by name Harika, approaching the tree and looking up at his prey; Palita at that moment, also saw a third enemy, an owl named Candraka, prowling from his nest situated on the branch of the same tree; apprehending danger from both directions, Palita decided to take help from the cat, his foe in distress, and find escape from all the three 12. 136. 26-42; he therefore addressed himself to the cat pointing out that there was danger to the life of both of them, that both lived on the same tree and therefore deserved to be friends of each other on the basis of common residence (savāso me 'si paṇḍitaḥ vl. paṇḍita 12. 136. 54), that he was prepared to cut the cords that bound the cat provided the cat agreed not to kill him when freed; Palita appealed to the cat: “I wish you live, and you should wish that I live” 12. 136. 48-62; the cat agreed to the proposal and asked Palita to do what was suited to the occasion; Palita swore by truth (satyena te śape 12. 136. 73) to cut down the net provided the cat agreed not to kill him when he descended and crawled very close to the body of the cat (ahaṁ tvānupravekṣyāmi 12. 136. 72); when the cat agreed to this, Palita went near the cat and rested quietly on his chest; seeing him safe, the mongoose and the owl returned to their residence 12. 136. 66-82; Palita then started to cut slowly the cords of the net; when the cat asked Palita to finish the work quickly, Palita advised him to be patient; Palita would complete cutting the net only when he saw the Caṇḍāla, who had spread the net, approach; otherwise the cat might prove dangerous to him; if the cat, when freed, saw the Caṇḍāla drawing near he would immediately mount the tree and not waste his time in jumping on the mouse; Palita then could safely enter his hole 12. 136. 83-93; when the cat persisted in asking Palita to make haste, Palita replied as follows: “I have made treaty with one who is stronger than me, I have therefore to protect myself; no one has any regard for the doer of a good act, once the act has been fully done; hence all good acts must be done with a part left unfinished (na hi kaś cit kṛte kārye kartāraṁ samavekṣate/tasmāt sarvāṇi kāryāṇi sāvaśeṣāṇi kārayet 12. 136. 105); now only one cord remains; I shall cut down that too at proper time” 12. 136. 100-107; at dawn when the Caṇḍāla Parigha appeared, true to his word, Palita cut off the last cord; the freed cat, as expected by Palita, jumped up the tree and Palita entered the hole 12. 136. 109-116; when the Caṇḍāla left the scene, the cat asked Palita to come out of the hole and move freely among the cats without apprehending any danger; he asked Palita to become his minister and even guide him like his father (amātyo me bhava prājña piteva hi praśādhi mām) 12. 136. 119-126; but Palita refused to oblige; he told the cat that there were no natural friends and no natural foes; hence there were no permanent friendships and no permanent enmities; friendships and enmities arise due to certain common or conflicting interests (nāsti jātyā rīpur nāma mitraṁ nāma na vidyate/sāmarthyayogāj jāyante mitrāṇi ripavas tathā//nāsti maitrī sthirā nāma na ca dhruvam asauhṛdam/arthayuktyā hi jāyante mitrāṇi ripavas tathā// 12. 136. 132, 134); danger arising out of misplaced trust cuts at the very roots; the affection between them arose for some purpose; once that purpose was served, friendship lost its ground; mouse was food, and cat the eater; mouse was weak cat strong; there could be no real conciliation (sandhi) among parties of uneven strength; Palita said he knew that it was the cat's food time; that was the reason why the cat was asking Palita to stir out; Palita finally told the cat that if he remembered Palita's good act let him wish well of the mouse (śivaṃ dhyāyasva me 'trasthaḥ sukṛtaṁ smaryate yadi) 12. 136. 160-166; the cat made one more attempt to win the confidence of Palita and praised him 12. 136. 177-182; Palita did not relent; he recited two gāthās of Uśanas (apparently 12. 136. 185-186) for the benefit of the cat the purport of which was that if one made conciliation (sandhi) with a person stronger than himself to face a common enemy he should not repose trust in his partner after the purpose was served and that in all conditions one should protect one's life since wealth and children could be aquired if one remained alive; Palita concluded that the sum and substance of the nītiśāstras was that distrust was the best policy (saṅkṣepo nītiśāstrāṇām aviśvāsaḥ paro mataḥ 12. 136. 187); Palita finally told the cat that the mouse must protect himself from the cat as the cat must protect himself from the Caṇḍāla; the cat, apparently scared at hearing the word ‘Caṇḍāla’, ran to his hole and Palita entered another hole; thus the intelligent Palita, all by himself, outwitted his many stronger enemies 12. 136. 182-192.

  D.   Epic events: (1) Yudhiṣṭhira asked Bhīṣma how the people of the Śvetadvīpa were born and what was the kind of life they were going to obtain after death (kathaṁ te puruṣā jātāḥ kā teṣāṁ gatir uttamā) 12. 322. 13; thereupon Bhīṣma replied to his question in details starting with the story of king Uparicara 12. 322. 16 ff.; Bhīṣma also told Yudhiṣṭhira how Nārada went to Śvetadvīpa 12. 324. 39; (2) Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṁpāyana why Nārada returned from the Śvetadvīpa to the Badarī āśrama to see Nara and Nārāyaṇa, how long he stayed there, and what were the questions he asked to those two Ṛṣis 12. 331. 15-18; thereupon Vaiśaṁpāyana replied to his question in details 12. 331. 19 ff. 

  E.   Past events: (1) Nārada standing on a peak of mountain Meru saw the Śvetadvīpa in the north-west direction as a wonderful spectacle 12. 322. 7-8; Nārada reached the Śvetadvīpa and saw the people there; he respected them by bowing down and they honoured him mentally (pūjayām āsa śirasā manasā taiś ca pūjitaḥ) 12. 325. 1-2; Bhagavān appeared before Nārada, but told him to leave the island immediately so that no disturbance was caused to the contemplations of the people of the Śvetadvīpa (gaccha nārada māciram//…ekāgrāś cintayeyur māṁ naiṣāṁ vighno bhaved iti) 12. 326. 17-18; 12. 331. 13; he left Śvetadvīpa and went to mount Meru and from there to Gandhamādana to reach Badarī 12. 331. 20-22; (also see the two epic events above); Nārada told Nara and Nārāyaṇa that he saw in Śvetadvīpa the people residing there 12. 331. 29-30; Nārāyaṇa asked Nārada if he saw in Śvetadvīpa the Bhagavān who was their (i. e. of Nara and Nārāyaṇa) higher prakṛti (api…sa bhagavān…śvetadvīpe tvayā dṛṣṭa āvayoḥ prakṛtiḥ parā) 12. 331. 35; Nārada replied that he did and also told them he saw the white people who were devoid of all sense-organs; as directed by Bhagavān he returned from Śvetadvīpa 12. 331. 36, 41, 51; 12. 332. 1; Nara and Nārāyaṇa then told Nārada that they too had seen him (Nārada) meeting the Bhagavān himself in Śvetadvīpa and had heard his conversation with him (āvābhyām api dṛṣṭas tvaṁ śvetadvīpe…/samāgato bhagavatā saṁjalpaṁ kṛtavān yathā//) 12. 332. 22; (2) A noncorporeal voice told Ekata, Dvita and Trita, who were practising severe austerities on mountain Meru to go to Śvetadvīpa where the Bhagavān had manifested himself (gacchadhvaṁ tatra) (i. e. Śvetadvīpa) munayas tatrātmā me prakāśitaḥ) 12. 323. 21-23, 26; they reached the Śvetadvīpa by following the way told to them by the noncorporeal voice; having reached the island, however, their eyes were blinded and they could not see any man (prāpya śvetaṁ mahādvīpaṁ…tato no dṛṣṭiviṣayas tadā pratihato 'bhavat) 12. 323. 27-28; when Ekata, Dvita and Trita further practised austerities for a hundred years they were able to see the people of the Śveta island; they had folded their hands and, facing north-east, they did the japa of Brahman; that japa was mental (nityāñjalikṛtān brahma japataḥ prāgudaṅmukhān/mānaso nāma sa japo japyate tair mahātmabhiḥ//) 12. 323. 32; suddenly they saw lustre equal to that of a thousand suns; the people of the island together began to run quickly, folding their hands and, delighted, they continued to say ‘namas’; when they were thus showing their reverence, we heard a loud sound (tato 'bhivadatāṁ teṣām aśrauṣma vipulaṁ dhvanim) 12. 323. 37; Ekata, Dvita and Trita were not able to see anything, but they could hear the praise of Bhagavān; at that time wind blew heavenly flowers and plants suitable for offerings; with that, people gave offering to Hari (baliḥ kilopahriyate tasya devasya tair naraiḥ); indeed, the god himself had arrived there when they were uttering sounds; from among those thousands of men no one welcomed them mentally, nor by looking at them; no one thought of them and hence they were worried (etasminn antare vāyuḥ…divyāny uvāha puṣpāṇi karmaṇyāś cauṣadhis tathā// …cintāvyākulitātmāno jātāḥ smo…/ mānavānāṁ sahasreṣu teṣu…/asmān na kaścin manasā cakṣuṣā vāpy apūjayat//… nāsmāsu dadhire bhāvam) 12. 323. 38-45; a non-corporeal being then told them that they had already seen the white people of the island and that seeing them was as good as seeing the chief god; they should therefore quit the island without delay (uvāca khasthaṁ kim api bhūtaṁ tatrāśarīrakam//dṛṣṭā vaḥ puruṣāḥ śvetāḥ… dṛṣṭo bhavati deveśa ebhir dṛṣṭair dvijottamāḥ//) 12. 323. 46-47; Bhagavān told Nārada that Ekata, Dvita and Trita had come to the Śveta island desirous of his darśana, but they could not see him (imaṁ deśam anuprāptā mama darśanalālasāḥ) 12. 326. 11; (3) Vaiśaṁpāyana informed Janamejaya that Nārada had told the Sātvata dharma to Vyāsa, which was, also called the dharma of the Ekāntins, followed by the white ascetics (dharmaḥ sātvato…/ evaṁ hi…nārado gurave mama/śvetānāṁ yatīnām āha ekāntagatim avyayām//) 12. 336. 76, 78-79 (These ‘white ascetics’ are probably to be identified with the people of the Śvetadvīpa. Nī., however, on 12. 348. 85; śvetānāṁ gṛhasthādīnām/yatīnāṁ kāṣāyadhāriṇām).

  A.   Description of their warriors: Sātvatas were invincible in battles; they hit their targets accurately in battles; they fought in various ways; they were conquerors of gods, demons and Gandharvas, but were not proud; they depended for victory on their own valour and were not dependent on others (na hi śakyā raṇe jetuṁ sātvatā…//labdhalakṣyāś ca saṁgrāme bahavaś citrayodhinaḥ/ devadānavagandharvān vijetāro hy avismitāḥ/svavīryavijaye yuktā naite paras parigrahāḥ//) 7. 119. 20-21 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 7. 144. 22; paraparigrahāḥ parādhināḥ); Sātvatas are not specifically mentioned in the army of Sātyaki but his army which consisted of warriors from different countries (tasya yodhā…nānādeśasamāgatāḥ) must have also some Sātvatas (as Sātvatas, formed a section of the Yādavas, and Sātyaki is often referred to as a Sātvata, see below section  C, A.  (5)); these warriors are described as heroic (vīra, mahāvīrya) and fighting with different kinds of weapons (nānāpraharaṇa) 5. 19. 2; their weapons detailed in 5. 19. 3-4. 

  B.   Epic events: (1) Kṛṣṇa while trying to pacify Baladeva and Vṛṣṇis who were angered at the abduction of Subhadrā by Arjuna by telling them that Arjuna did not think of Sātvatas as covetous of wealth (arthalubdhān na vaḥ pārtho manyate sātvatān sadā) 1. 213. 3; (2) Aśvatthāman was honoured by Kurus, Pāṇḍavas and Sātvatas (upāsyamāno bahubhiḥ kurupāṇḍavasātvatatḥ) 7. 61. 14; (3) Sātvatas, along with Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas, followed Bhīma and Arjuna who led the attack on Droṇa from the southern and northern side (bībhatsur dakṣiṇaṁ pārśvam uttaraṁ tu vṛkodaraḥ) 7. 132. 41; (4) Nārāyaṇa had told Nārada that he as Kṛṣṇa would bring about the annihilation of all the chiefs of Sātvatas which was tantamount to the destruction of his kinsmen (sarvasātvatamukhyānāṁ dvārakāyāś ca…/kariṣye pralayaṁ ghoram ātmajñātivināśanam) 12. 326. 92.

Origin: The family was named Bhārata after Bharata; his descendants as well as those who preceded him (?) were known as Bhāratas; the fame of Bhāratas was due to Bharata (bharatād bhārātī kīrtir yenedaṁ bhārataṁ kulam/apare ye ca pūrve ca bhāratā iti viśrutāḥ) 1. 69. 49; 1. 89. 16; 13. 75. 26; (1. 1. 44). 

  B.   Lineage (vaṁśa or kula), its importance: Since the lineage was established by Bharatas it was known as Bhārata (yenedaṁ (i. e. bharatena) bhārataṁ kulam) 1. 69. 49; bhārataṁ vaṁśam 1, 99. 47; Arjuna born in the lineage of Bharata (jātasya bhārate vaṁśe) 2. 16. 1; Duryodhana born in the lineage of Bharata (jāto 'si bhārate vaṁśe) 5. 7. 27; (bhārataṁ kulaṁ) 1. 69. 49; 1. 92. 12; it was respected by all kings (bhārate vaṁśe sarvapārthivapūjite) 5. 7. 27. 

  C.   The narrative of Bhāratas, its importance: Vaiśaṁpāyana having received it from his teacher Vyāsa was eager to narrate the narrative of Bhāratas to Janamejaya, who was a worthy person to listen to it (śrotuṁ pātraṁ ca rājaṁs tvaṁ prāpyemāṁ bhāratīṁ kathām/guror vaktuṁ parispando mudā protsāhatīva mām//) 1. 55. 3; it was told in the sarpasatra of king Janamejaya (katheyam…bhāratānām) 1. 2. 74; one who listened to the narration of the birth of Bhāratas has no fear from diseases, least of all of the next world; it was holy, brought wealth, fame, long life and heaven; it is also large and leads to bliss (bhāratānāṁ mahaj janma śṛṇvatām …/nāsti vyādhibhayaṁ teṣāṁ paralokabhayaṁ kutaḥ//dhanyaṁ yaśasyam āyuṣyaṁ svargyaṁ puṇyaṁ tathaivaca) 1. 56. 24-25; (vaṁśaṁ…/tathaiva bhāratānāṁ ca puṇyaṁ svastyayanaṁ mahat/dhanyaṁ yaśasyam āyuṣyaṁ kīrtayiṣyāmi te 'nagha//) 1. 70. 2; Mahābhārata so called because it describes the life of the Bhāratas; that is the etymology of the word (bhāratānāṁ mahaj janma mahābhāratam ucyate/ niruktam asya yo veda) 1. 56. 31.

_______________________________
*1st word in right half of page p44  (+offset) in original book.Maghā  : f. (pl.): Name of a nakṣatra. 

  A.   Event: Mythological: Sunda and Upasunda, after performing at night the ceremonies suitable for moving out, marched out under the constellation Maghā for their conquest of the three worlds (kṛtvā prāsthānikaṁ rātrau maghāsu yayatus tadā) 1. 202. 2 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 210. 2: maghāsu gamanārthaṁ niṣiddhe 'pi nakṣatre asuratvād yayatuḥ). 

  B.   Importance: A certain tīrtha named jointly after the Kṛttikā and the Maghā; by visiting this tīrtha one obtained the merit of performing the Agniṣṭoma and the Atirātra sacrifices (kṛttikāmaghayoś caiva tīrtham) 3. 82. 46. 

  C.   Omens: (1) Vyāsa told Dhṛtarāṣṭra before the start of the war that a calamity was predicted for the two armies by the planet Mars making retrograde movement under the Maghā (maghāsv aṅgārako vakraḥ) 6. 3. 13; (2) Saṁjaya told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that rhe armies of the Kauravas gathered for war at Kurukṣetra on the day when the moon entered the Maghā and the seven principal planets, shining, came together in the sky (maghāviṣayagaḥ somas tad dinaṁ pratyapadyata/dīpyamānāś ca saṁpetur divi sapta mahāgrahāḥ//) 6. 17. 2 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 17. 2 has a long commentary trying to reconcile the astronomical statements. He does not interpret maghāviṣaya as the region of the constellation Maghā but as pitṛdeśa: maghā pitrayaṁ nakṣatraṁ tasya viṣayo deśaḥ pitṛlokas tadgataḥ somaḥ/…etena yuddhāraṁbhaṁ prakṛtya ‘maghāviṣayagaḥ somas tad dinaṁ pratyapadyata’ iti bhīṣmaparvaṇi sañjayavākyān maghāyāṁ yuddhāraṁbha ity api nirastam/ …mahāgrahāḥ rāhuketvor upagrahatvāt saptaiva). 

  D.   Religious rites: (1) dāna: Nārada told Devakī (13. 63. 2-4) that by offering plates (? rather ‘heaps’) full of sesame one had many sons and cattle in this life and enjoyed life after death (maghāsu tilapūrṇāni vardhamānāni mānavaḥ/pradāya putrapaśumān iha pretya ca modate) 13. 63. 12; (2) śrāddha: Yama told Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that by offering a kāmya śrāddha under the Maghā (maghāsu) one became eminent among kinsmen 13. 89. 5; (3) Bhīṣma recited for Yuḍhiṣṭhira the gāthās sung by the manes which were recited for him formerly by the venerable Sanatkumāra; according to these gāthās the manes cherished a wish that some one would be born in their line who would offer to them on the thirteenth day under the Maghā, during the Dakṣiṇāyana, rice boiled in milk, together with clarified butter or meat of red goat, that was fanned, according to the rites, by the (elephant's) ear, under the shadow of an elephant (gāthāś cāpy atra gāyanti pitṛgītā yudhiṣṭhira/sanatkumāro bhagavān purā mayy abhyabhāṣata//api naḥ sa kule jāyād yo no dadyāt trayodaśīm/maghāsu sarpiṣā yuktaṁ pāyasaṁ dakṣiṇāyane//ājena vāpi lauhena maghāsv eva yatavrataḥ/hasticchāyāsu vidhivat karṇavyajanavījitam//) 13. 88. 11-13. (Interpretation of hasticchāyā as an eclipse in this context is not favoured by the commentators on the Manusmṛti; on Manu 3. 274, which has the reading prākchāye kuñjarasya ca, Kullūka observes: hastinaḥ pūrvāṁ diśaṁ gatāyāṁ chāyāyām…na tu trayodaśīhasticchāyayoḥ samuccayaḥ/; Medhātithi on the same stanza: tathā kuñjarasya hastinaḥ prākchāye prācyāṁ diśi gatāyāṁ chāyāyām aparāṇhetare kāla ity arthaḥ/… yat tu vyācakṣate rāhūparāgo hasticchāyocyate…tad ayuktam/; Rāghavānanda: kuñjarasyaiva chāyā vivakṣitā na tu yogaviśeṣaḥ/karṇavyajanavījitam iti vākyāntarāc ceti which latter is an obvious reference to the Mbh. passage).

(8) Leaving behind his daughter Srucāvatī in the āśrama, Bhāradvāja repaired to the forest on Himavant (jagāma himavadvanam) 9. 47. 60; (9) The great sage Bhṛgu approached Himavant and asked for his daughter; Himavant told Bhṛgu that the desired bridegroom was Rudra (tam abravīd dhimavān abhilaṣito varo rudra iti); since Bhṛgu's request was rejected by Himavant the former uttered a curse that the mountain would not be a source of jewels; that word of the sage is true even today (na ratnānāṁ bhavān bhājanaṁ bhaviṣyatīti/adyaprabhṛty etad avasthitam ṛṣivacanam) 12. 329. 49 (2-5); (10) Vadānya told Aṣṭāvakra to cross the place of Kubera, the mountain Himavant, and the place of Rudra to see the direction Uttarā;

13. 20. 2-3, 28-29; (11) Sage Mārkaṇḍeya saw Himavant in the belly of the Bāla (13. 186. 83 = Nārāyaṇa 13. 187. 3) 3. 186. 101; (12) The Vālakhilyas, when appeased by Kaśyapa, left the branch of the Rohiṇa tree (1. 25. 31) on which they were hanging and went to Himavant to practise austerities 1. 26. 14; (13) When the descendants of Kṛtavīrya destroyed the Bhṛgus, even those who were still in the womb, the women of the Bhṛgu family fled and took resort on Himavant (himavantaṁ prapedire) 1. 169. 19; (14) Leaving Arundhatī behind at the Badarapācana tīrtha the seven sages went to Himavant; while they obtained their livelihood in a forest on Himavant, there occurred a severe drought lasting for twelve years; Mahādeva told the seven sages that the merit which they had acquired by their austerities on Himavant (himavatpṛṣṭhe) was not equal to the merit of Arundhatī's austerities 9. 47. 28, 30, 41; (15) Vyāsa resorted to the east of Himavant and there, in a solitary place, taught Vedas to his pupils Sumantu, Vaiśaṁpāyana, Jaimini, and Paila (aindrīṁ tu diśam āsthāya śailarājasya dhīmataḥ/vivikte parvatataṭe…vedān adhyāpayām āsa vyāsaḥ) 12. 314. 23-24; Vyāsa lived on Himavant (himavatpṛṣṭhe) teaching (Vedas) to his pupils and his son 12. 314. 30; once his pupils expressed their wish to leave the mountain and go to the plains to propagate the Vedas at different places, if that pleased Vyāsa (śailād asmān mahīṁ gantuṁ kāṅkṣitaṁ no mahāmune/vedān anekadhā kartum yadi te rucitaṁ vibho) 12. 315. 4; (16) Nārada once visited Himavant 12. 314. 3; he saw Vyāsa all alone and silent in his āśrama on Himavant; the sage told Vyāsa that the mountain, without the sound of the Vedas, was not delightful as before (brahmaghoṣair virahitaḥ parvato 'yaṁ na śobhate/ …na bhrājate yathāpūrvam…vedadhvaninirākṛtaḥ) 12. 315. 11-14; (17) Śuka, son of Vyāsa, after he was instructed by Janaka in Mithilā, journeyed to the north through air to reach Himavant (prāyād udaṅmukhaḥ/śaiśiraṁ girim uddiśya sadharmā mātariśvanaḥ) 12. 314. 2; Śuka saw his father surrounded by pupils in his āśrama; Vyāsa saw his son arriving, lustrous like the sun; Śuka told his father all about his conversation with Janaka 12. 314. 25-29; when Śuka got the consent of Nārada to leave this world he went to meet his father; after a pradakṣiṇā of him, Śuka, intent on achieving liberation (mokṣa), took leave of his father 12. 318. 60-61, 63; Śuka went up to the summit of Himavant and sat there on a desolate table-land (giripṛṣṭhaṁ samāruhya…same deśe vivikte ca…upāviśat); taking recourse to Yoga he went beyond the sky to reach the path of liberation (sa punar yogam āsthāya mokṣamārgopalabdhaye/ mahāyogīśvaro bhūtvā so 'tyakrāmad vihāyasam//) 12. 319. 1, 6; when Śuka attained perfection (siddhi) and was established in brahman (brahmaṇi pratyatiṣṭhat saḥ) some unexpected things happened; one of them was that it appeared due to loud thunders that Himavant was being torn asunder (nirghātaśabdaiś ca girir himavān dīryatīva ha) 12. 320. 5; he then saw before him towards the north two heavenly summits closely attached to each other, one of Himavant, white and silvery, and the other of Meru, yellow and golden; the two peaks were a hundred yojanas in height and width (śṛṅge…himavanmerusaṁbhave/saṁśliṣṭe śvetapīte dve rukmarūpyamaye śubhe// śatayojanavistāre tiryag ūrdhvaṁ ca bhārata/udīcīṁ diśam āśritya) 12. 320. 8-9; undeterred Śuka continued to fly upwards: then a wonderful thing happened--the two peaks suddenly got seperated and Śuka swiftly passed through them; the excellent mountain (Himavant ? Meru ?) could not check Śuka's gait; those who lived in heaven and on the mountain uttered a loud cry (tataḥ parvataśṛṅge dve sahasaiva dvidhākṛte/adṛśyatāṁ mahārāja tad adbhutam ivābhavat// tataḥ parvataśṛṇgābhyāṁ sahasaiva viniḥsṛtaḥ/na ca pratijaghānāsya sa gatiṁ parvatottamaḥ//) 12. 320. 10-12; Vyāsa who followed Śuka saw his son pass through the mountain peak rent into two (dvidhā kṛtvā parvatāgram) 12. 320. 21; Vyāsa then sat down on the summit of the mountain (giriprasthe) thinking continuously of his son (putram evānucintayan) 12. 320. 27; (18) A certain Brāhmaṇa, son of Pippalāda and of Kuśika gotra, lived at the foot of Himavant engaged in Vedic studies (brāhmaṇo jāpakaḥ kaścit…paippalādiḥ sa kauśikaḥ/ …himavatpādasaṁśrayaḥ) 12. 192. 4-5 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 199. 4: jāpakaḥ mantrādhyayanaparaḥ); (19) A certain Śūdra approached the head of an āśrama of the Brāhmaṇas on Himavant (brahmāśramapade vṛttaṁ pārśve himavataḥ śubhe) 13. 10. 5, 10 (the āśrama described 13. 10. 6-9); (20) An owl named Prākārakarṇa lived on Himavant; Indradyumna became a horse and carried Mārkaṇḍeya to the owl on the distant Himavant (prakṛṣṭe cādhvani himavān) 3. 191. 4-5; (21) A lotus pond on Himavant (himavataḥ…kamalākaraḥ) waited in person (sākṣāt) on the brahmanical sage Jīmūta 5. 109. 21; (22) Gaṅgā, unable to bear the seed (emitted lustre of Maheśvara tejo māheśvaraṁ skannam 9. 43. 6) placed in her by Agni, released it on Himavant (utsasarja girau ramye himavati); there it grew and was seen by the Kṛṭṭikās in a cluster of reeds 9. 43. 9-11; Nārada went to see Himavant where Kumāra (Skanda) in his childhood threw his śakti on earth; he challenged any one to uproot or shake the śakti (himavantam iyād draṣṭum…/yatraiva ca kumāreṇa… śaktir nyastā kṣititale) 12. 314. 3, 7-10; Prahlāda in his effort to draw out the śakti fainted on the summit of the mountain (mūrcchito girimūrdhani) 12. 314. 16-17; gods, led by Brahman, took Kumāra to the best mountain (Himavant), to Sarasvatī of Himavant for his coronation (abhiṣekārtham ājagmuḥ śailendram…/ haimavatīm…sarasvatīm) 9. 43. 50-51; Himavant present at the time of the coronation 9. 44. 13; he gave for coronation an excellent, divine seat decorated with excellent gems and heavenly jewels (himavatā datte …niṣaṇṇaḥ paramāsane) 9. 44. 2; after the coronation, Himavant gave to Kumāra as his attendants (anucarau) Suvarcas and Ativarcas 9. 44. 42; Skanda, while shooting arrows at Śveta mountain, pierced Krauñca mountain, the son of Himavant (bibheda sa śaraiḥ śailaṁ krauñcaṁ himavataḥ sutam);

(25) Śiva always went to the northern side of Himavant (yatrottarāṁ diśaṁ gatvā śailarājasya pārśvataḥ) to practise austerities 12. 314. 18; when Śiva practised austerities on Himavant (giritaṭe 13. 127. 17), the mountain shone due to Śiva's austerites (sa giris tapasā tasya bhūteśasya vyarocata) 13. 127. 2, 10; Umā also resorted to that place on Himavant (sevantī himavatpārśvam) and approached Śiva 13. 127. 25; when she closed the eyes of Śiva with her hands a big flame issued from his forehead; the mountain was afflicted by Śiva's third eye which looked like the sun (yenāsau mathito giriḥ) 13. 127. 29-30, 45, (mathitaṁ śailam) 36; the flame burnt the whole forest on Himavant; hence the animals came to Śiva's abode for shelter; the entire mountain Himavant, with its peaks full of minerals and herbs in its forests, was burnt in a moment (kṣaṇena tena dagdhaḥ sa himavān abhavan nagaḥ/sadhātuśikharābhogo dīnadagdhavanauṣadhiḥ//); when Śiva noticed that Umā was unhappy due to the wretched condition of her father, he looked with affection at the mountain and it returned to its former original condition, beautiful to look at (śarvaḥ …prītyāpaśyat tato girim/tato 'bhavat punaḥ sarvaḥ prakṛtisthaḥ sudarśanaḥ) 13. 127. 32-39, 42, 45;

Kṛṣṇa observed a vrata, lasting for twelve years on Himavant (vrataṁ cartum ihāyātas tv ahaṁ girim imaṁ śubham) 13. 126. 10, 33; the unthinkable miracle of fire issuing from the mouth of Kṛṣṇa (13. 126. 16) witnessed by Nārada and other sages on Himavant (yad āścaryaṁ acintyaṁ ca girau himavati prabho/anubhūtaṁ munigaṇaiḥ) 13. 126. 48-49; the fire burnt the mountain with its trees, creepers and bushes, as well as all kinds of animals; the snmmit of the mountain was afflicted (śikharaṁ tasya śailasya mathitam) 13. 126. 17-18; (etad tad vaiṣṇavaṁ tejo mama vaktrād viniḥsṛtam/…yenāyaṁ mathito giriḥ) 13. 126. 30; Viṣṇu by looking at the forest with gentle eyes brought it back to its original condition (saumyair dṛṣṭinipātais tat punaḥ prakṛtim ānayat 13. 126. 20-21, 36; (28) When Rudra and Nārāyaṇa fought with each other the ocean went dry and Himavant was shattered (himavāṁś ca vyaśīryata) 12. 330. 54;

Śiva asked Indra to turn (the summit of) the mountain and enter it (vivartayainaṁ ca mahādrirājam…/sa tad vivṛtya śikharaṁ mahāgireḥ); when Indra did what he was asked to do he saw four former Indras, equal to him in lustre, held captive there 1. 189. 14, 19-20; Śiva asked Indra to enter the cave of the mountain and stay there (darīm etāṁ praviśa tvam śatakrato…etāṁ darim āviśya śedhvam) 1. 189. 14, 19-24, 32; (31) Upaśruti crossed Himavant and went with Indrāṇī to a big island in the ocean to the north of the mountain (himavantam atikramya uttaraṁ pārśvam āgamat/samudraṁ ca samāsādya…āsasāda mahādvipam) 5. 14. 5-6; (32) Mṛtyu, conceived as a woman, reluctant to carry out the instruction of Pitāmaha to deprive people of their lives, went to the top of Himavant (himavato mūrdhni) and stood there for an extremely long period (nikharvam aparaṁ tataḥ/tasthau) on her toe to satisfy Pitāmaha 12. 250. 23; (33) Śeṣa, disgusted with the behaviour of his stupid brothers, left his mother Kadrū and went to different places to practise austerities, one of them being the slope of Himavant (himavatas taṭe) 1. 32. 2-3;

  I.   Modes of expression: These are based on various characteristics of the mountain: (a) Steadiness: (i) Himavant might start moving about, but Duḥśāsana would not rule the earth without Duryodhana (himavāṁś ca parivrajet/…na cāhaṁ tvad ṛte rājan praśāseyaṁ vasundharām) 3. 238. 31; (ii) If Arjuna's words were to prove false then, indeed, Himavant may move from its place (caled dhi himavān sthānāt…matsatyaṁ vicaled yadi) 2. 68. 35; the same said by Kṛṣṇa (caled dhi himavāñ śailo …na me moghaṁ vaco bhavet) 5. 80. 48; (b) Solid form: (i) Kṛṣṇa to Draupadī: Himavant may be shattered, but his words would not be false (himavāñ śīryet…na me moghaṁ vaco bhavet) 3. 13. 117; (ii) Duryodhana to Dhṛtarāṣṭra: Even Himavant would be shattered in a hundred thousand ways if hit just once by Duryodhana with his gadā (gadāprahārābhihato himavān api parvataḥ/…viśīryeta giriḥ śatasahasradhā) 5. 54. 38; (iii) Hearing Bhīma's loud roar after the death of Jarāsaṁdha people wondered if Himavant had split (kiṁ nu svid dhimavān bhinnaḥ) 2. 22. 9; (c) Not subject to reduction in size: Even Himavant would decay under certain conditions (bhakṣyamāṇo hy anāvāpaḥ kṣīyate himavān api) 3. 33. 9; (d) Not to be easily toppled down: Himavant is one of the four mountains which cannot be easily toppled down (himavān… catvāraḥ parvatāḥ kena pātitā bhuvi tejasā) 3. 297. 14; (e) Very large size: Bhīma to Yudhiṣṭhira--Yudhiṣṭhira's wish to hide Pāṇḍavas for a year was like trying to hide Himavant with a handful of grass (tṛṇānāṁ muṣṭinaikena himavantaṁ tu parvatam/ channam icchasi kaunteya yo 'smān saṁvartum icchasi) 3. 36. 22; (f) Strength: Bhīma to Kṛṣṇa--even Himavant, ocean and Indra together cannot rescue a person attacked by Bhīma (himavāṁś ca samudraś ca vajrī ca…/mayābhipannaṁ trāyeran balam āsthāya na trayaḥ) 5. 74. 10; (g) Impassableness: One cannot say that the back side of Himavant does not exsit simply because men have not seen it (yathā himavataḥ pṛṣṭhaṁ …na dṛṣṭapūrvaṁ manujair na ca tan nāsti tāvatā) 12. 196. 6; (h) Mighty elephants at its foot: Wishing to defeat Yudhiṣṭhira was like driving away with a stick a huge elephant in rut roaming at the foot of Himavant with its herd (nāgam…upatyakāṁ haimavatīṁ carantam/daṇḍīva yūthād apasedhase tvaṁ yo jetum āśaṁsasi dharmarājam//) 3. 252. 5. 

  J.   Relationships with Himavant: (a) Daughters of Himavant: (i) Umā (himavato girer duhitaram umām) 12. 329. 49(1); (umāṁ…pitur dainyam anicchantīm) 13. 127. 37; (ii) River Gaṅgā: (himavataḥ sutā) 3. 108. 8; 6. 114. 90; (śailarājasutāṁ nadīm) 3. 108. 4; (sutāvanīdhrasya harasya bhāryā) 13. 27. 88 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 26. 89: avanīdhrasya meroḥ himavato vā parvatasya); (b) Sons of Himavant: (i) Mountain Krauñca (krauñcaṁ himavataḥ sutam) 3. 214. 31; (ii) Mountain Arbuda (himavatsutam arbudam) 3. 80. 74; (c) Father-in-law of Śaṁkara (himavān puṇyaḥ śaṁkaraśvaśuro giriḥ) 13. 26. 57; (d) General association: Gandhamādana mountain called haimavata mountain 3. 157. 3.

  D.   Use of Cakra in epithets: Kṛṣṇa (Viṣṇu) has epithets like cakrin 13. 135. 110. 120 (Viṣṇu); sacakraḥ 6. 55. 101; cakrāyudha 1. 17. 6 (Viṣṇu); 5. 3. 16; 15. 32. 10; cakradhara 7. 115. 17 (Sātyaki called cakradharaprabhāva); rathāṅgapāṇi 13. 135. 120 (Viṣṇu); rathacakrabhṛt 5. 103. 18; cakragadābhṛt 5. 81. 14; cakragadādhara 5. 89. 15; 5. 103. 35 (Viṣṇu ?); 11. 25. 39; 13. 135. 71 (Viṣṇu); 14. 2. 11; 14. 90. 8; 16. 9. 28; cakragadāpāṇi 1. 58. 50 (Nārāyaṇa); śaṅkhacakragadādhara 3. 19. 27; 3. 187. 38 (Nārāyaṇa); 3. 256. 29; 6. 62. 14; 13. 14. 142; 13. 153. 37; 14. 54. 22; 16. 9. 19; śāṅkhacakragadāhasta 5. 48. 23; śaṅkhacakrāsipāṇi 8. 57. 48 (Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa); śārṅgarathāṅgapāṇi 6. 55. 94; śārṅgacakragadādhara 2. 42. 34; 16. 4. 44; śārṅgacakrāsipāṇi 12. 43. 16. 

  E.   Aśvatthāman incident: Aśvatthāman was forbidden to use the Brahmaśiras astra on any occasion whatsoever; so he wanted to exchange Brahmaśiras for Kṛṣṇa's Sudarśana; Kṛṣṇa allowed Aśvatthāman to choose any one of his missiles, including the Cakra, which he felt he could wield and use in the battle; Aśvatthāman opted for the Cakra, and when allowed by Kṛṣṇa to take it, he first tried to pick it up with his left hand; failing to move it, he tried his right hand; when he could not move the Cakra even with his right hand, he used all his might (i. e. probably used both his hands together); having failed in this attempt too, Aśvatthāman in despair abandoned the attempt; Kṛṣṇa then told him that he had asked for something very unusual, for not even Arjuna, Pradyumna, (Bala)rāma, Gada, Sāmba, nor any one of the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka heroes living in Dvārakā had asked for it; Kṛṣṇa, out of curiosity, asked Aśvatthāman whom he wanted to fight with equipped with Sudarśana; Aśvatthāman admitted that he wanted to fight with Kṛṣṇa himself and become invincible; Aśvatthāman realised that the Cakra would not leave Kṛṣṇa and bence he left Dvārakā without it 10. 12. 14-38. 

  F.   Its use: (1) In wars or events not related to the epic: (i) when Viṣṇu was distributing the amṛta among the gods, Rāhu cunningly managed to get it; as the amṛta had reached Rāhu's throat, Viṣṇu used the Cakra to cut off his head; when severed by the Cakra, the head fell on the ground and shook the earth 1. 17. 5-7; (ii) in the war that ensued between the gods and the demons after the above incident Nara and Nārāyaṇa appeared on the scene; Viṣṇu (Narāyaṇa) then thought of his Sudarśana cakra; as soon as thought of, it arrived from the sky (tato 'mbarāc cintitamātram āgatam 1. 17. 20); armed with it, Viṣṇu used it against the demons; it struck them again and again and cut off the Daityas to pieces in thousands; sometimes it lieked the Dānavas and, overpowering them, cut them off; sometimes it burnt them like fire; hurled now in the sky and then on the ground it drunk their blood like a Piśāca; having heard that the Sudarśana cakra was angry, the demons disappeared entering the earth and the ocean 1. 17. 18-28; (iii) in Kṛṣṇa's war with Śālva who was fighting from his Saubhapura, Kṛṣṇa released his sharp-edged discuss, here called his dear (dayita) Āgneya astra (3. 23. 28), after reciting mantras over it (abhimantrya 3. 23. 30) and using the strength of his arm (bhujavīryeṇa 3. 23. 31); Kṛṣṇa directed his Cakra to strike down with its might the Saubha and all the enemies living there; the missile cut into two the Saubha town in the middle as a saw might cut a pillar; after achieving its objective the missile returned to Kṛṣṇa's hand; Kṛṣṇa again shook it upwards with great speed and released it with the words: “(now) for Śālva” (punaś coddhūya vegena śālvāyety aham abruvam 3. 23. 35); the discuss instantly cut Śālva into two, who was then wielding a heavy gadā, and then it blazed with its lustre 3. 23. 28-36; (2) In wars or events related to the epic: (1) at the time of the Khāṇḍava fire, Kṛṣṇa killed many hosts of Daityas and Dānavas with his Cakra; many others, were blown away by the speed of the Cakra (cakravegeritāḥ) 1. 218. 26-27; in this incident Kṛṣṇa released his Cakra on animals and other beings (tathānyā bhūtajātayaḥ 1. 219. 2) so that these, along with the Dānavas and the night-stalkers (sadānavaniśācarāḥ 1. 219. 4) were cut into pieces by hundreds and they fell into the fire; the Rākṣasas, cut by the Cakra of Kṛṣṇa, looked like evening clouds; Kṛṣṇa moved there like the god of Death killing by thousands Piśācas, birds, serpents and animals with his Cakra; the Cakra, repeatedly hurled, killed many beings and returned to Kṛṣṇa's hand 1. 219. 2-7; if the Rākṣasas, Dānavas and serpents tried to escape together (ekāyanagatāḥ saṅghībhūtāḥ Nī. on 1. 228. 34 Bom. Ed.) even then Kṛṣṇa killed them and they fell into the flaming fire 1. 219. 30-31; Kṛṣṇa saw Asura Maya fleeing from the house of Takṣaka and when Agni showed his desire to burn him, Kṛṣṇa stood ready with his raised Cakra to kill him; but Maya sought help from Arjuna and was saved 1. 219. 35-39; (2) Enraged Kṛṣṇa cut off the head of Śiśupāla with Cakra at the time of the Rājasūya 2. 42. 21; 3. 15. 3-4; 12-13 (use of Cakra not mentioned). 

  G.   Threatened or eventual use in the epic war: (1) Disappointed at Arjuna's softness (mṛduyuddhatām 6. 55. 63, 80) while fighting with Bhīṣma, Kṛṣṇa took up his discuss (rathāṅgam) with a view to killing Bhīṣma; raising his Cakra he jumped down from the chariot and proceeded on foot to attack Bhīṣma; the Sudarśana, lotus-like and having a beautiful nave, shone like the primeval lotus (ādipadma) rising from the navel of Nārāyaṇa; seeing Kṛṣṇa equipped with Cakra all beings cried aloud thinking that that was the end of the Kurus; Kṛṣṇa, holding the Cakra and jumping along, looked as if he was revolving the world, or he looked like the god of Death in the form of Fire burning the creatures (saṁvartayiṣyann iva jīvalokam/…bhūtāni dhakṣyann iva kālavahniḥ) 6. 55. 92); (2) seeing Kṛṣṇa rushing towards him with Cakra in hand, Bhīṣma invited him from his chariot to put an end to his life; when Arjuna, coming from behind, assured Kṛṣṇa that he would destroy the Kurus, Kṛṣṇa returned and holding the discuss, mounted the chariot 6. 55. 83, 86-87, 89-94, 100-101; (3) Apprehending that Arjuna might not be able to fulfil his vow to kill Jayadratha before sunset, Kṛṣṇa thought that his intervention in the war might become necessary and he therefore asked Dāruka, his charioteer, to keep his chariot ready with all the missiles in it, including Cakra, so that he would destroy the enemy's army with it 7. 56. 32, 28. (4) Kṛṣṇa, in order to incite Arjuna who was somewhat overpowered by Karṇa, showed readiness to give his Cakra to him to cut off Karṇa's head with it 8. 65. 19. 

  H.   Actual or possible defeat of Sudarśana: (1) Viṣṇu's Cakra was shattered on the limbs of Mandara, the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu, owing to a boon Mandara had received from Mahādeva (Śiva) 13. 14. 54; (2) even Kṛṣṇa with his Sudarśana would not be able to vanquish Karṇa as long as he was armed with Indra's (vāsavī) Śakti and was protected by his armour and kuṇḍalas 7. 155. 17, (13-15). 

  I.   End When the end of the Yādavas had arrived and when they started for the tīrthayātrā on the shore of the ocean, the Cakra, given to Kṛṣṇa by Agni, left him and rose to the sky even as the Vṛṣṇis watched it 16. 4. 3; when Yudhiṣṭhira relinquished the kingdom to Parikṣit and the Pāṇḍavas started for the forest, god Agni appeared in bodily form (17. 1. 33) and told them that the excellent Cakra which stayed with Kṛṣṇa had disappeared and that it would return to his hand at the proper time (cakraratnaṁ tu yat kṛṣṇe sthitam āsīn mahātmani/gataṁ tac ca punar haste kālenaiṣyati tasya ha//) 17. 1. 38.

  A.   Location: In the west 3. 87. 1.

Past events: (1) Arjuna, while recounting the past austerities performed by Kṛṣṇa, said that formerly he once lived at the Puṣkaras (puṣkareṣu) for ten thousand and ten hundred years living only on water 3. 13. 1; (2) When the Pitāmaha was once engaged in a sacrifice at the Puṣkara (puṣkarasthe pitāmahe), the sages said that the sacrifice will not yield great fruit (nāyaṁ yajño mahāphalaḥ) as the Sarasvatī was not to be seen there; hearing that, the Pitāmaha thought of the river and invited her to appear at the Puṣkaras (puṣkareṣu) which she did as the river Suprabhā; thus the Sarasvatī became manifest at the Puṣkaras (puṣkareṣu) for the sake of the Pitāmaha and for the satisfaction of the wise 9. 37. 11, 12, 14. 

  E.   Holiness: (1) There are āśramas of the Vaikhānasas, the Siddhas, and the sages at the Puṣkara 3. 87. 13; one should settle down there (samāviśet) 3. 80. 41; gods and sages achieved there (puṣkareṣu) great perfection and were endowed with great merit (siddhiṁ samabhisaṁprāptāḥ puṇyena mahatānvitāḥ) 3. 80. 47; (2) Prajāpati sang a gāthā at the Puṣkaras (puṣkareṣu) in praise of the Puṣkaras: If a spirited person (manasvin) even mentally longs for the Puṣkaras (puṣkarāṇi) his sins are destroyed and he is delighted in heaven (nākapṛṣṭhe ca modate) 3. 87. 14-15; (3) The wise say that one who is engaged in the worship of the manes and gods (pitṛdevārcane rataḥ) and who takes bath (abhiṣeka) in this tīrtha gets the fruit of a horse sacrifice ten times (aśvamedhaṁ daśaguṇaṁ pravadanti manīṣiṇaḥ); if a person of any one of the four classes bathes there these high-souled persons are then not born in a lower species (na viyoniṁ vrajanty ete snātās tīrthe mahātmanaḥ); if one visits the Puṣkara especially on the full moon day of the month of Kārtika his fruit increases without ever being destroyed (phalaṁ tatrākṣayaṁ tasya vardhate) 3. 80. 48, 51-52; stay at the Puṣkara on the full moon night of the Kārtika (kārtikīṁ vā vased ekām) is equal to performing an Agnihotra for a full hundred years (varṣaśataṁ pūrṇaṁ agnihotram) 3. 80. 57; (4) One who remembers the Puṣkara morning and evening with folded hands will have bathed in all the tīrthas and will get imperishable worlds in the abode of Brahman (upaspṛṣṭaṁ bhavet tena sarvatīrtheṣu bhārata prāpnuyāc ca naro lokān brahmaṇaḥ sadane 'kṣayān) 3. 80. 53 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 82. 33: upaspṛṣṭaṁ snātaṁ bhavet); whatever sin is committed by a man or a woman it gets destroyed as soon as one bathes in the Puṣkara (puṣkare snātamātrasya) 3. 80. 54; if a wise person even mentally longs for the Puṣkaras (manasāpy abhikāmasya puṣkarāṇi manasvinaḥ) all his sins are cleansed and he is worshipped in heaven (nākapṛṣṭhe ca pūjyate) 3. 80. 45; (5) At the Puṣkara ten thousand crores of tīrthas are present at all the three divisions of the day (sāṁnidhyaṁ puṣkare yeṣāṁ trisandhyam) 3. 83. 42; (6) At this tīrtha the Ādityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the Sādhyas, the Maruts, the Gandharvas, and the Apsarases are present at all times; Pitāmaha lived there happily for ever 3. 80. 43, 46; (7) The gods, the Daityas, and the Brahmanical sages practised austerities and, by the great religious merit thus acquired, they attained divine yoga (divyayogāḥ), i. e., they attained perfection (siddhiṁ samabhisaṁprāptāḥ) 3. 80. 44, 47; (8) By living at the Puṣkara for twelve years a person who is controlled and pure (niyataḥ śuciḥ) obtains the fruit of all sacrifices and goes to the world of Brahman 3. 80. 56; (9) Puṣkara is one of those place by visiting which one becomes auspicious, has a divine form, puts on heavenly garlands and being rich in heavenly fragrance delights in the world of the cows (? modanti gavāṁ vimāne) 13. 105. 44, 48 (for citation see  Karatoyinī ); (10) Aṅgiras told Gautama that by bathing (vigāhya) in the Puṣkara one rides in the Vimāna (vimānasthaḥ) and is awakened by the praises of the Apsarases 13. 26. 9; (11) Śaunaka advised Janamejaya to visit the Puṣkara; such visit gave the person longevity again in this life (labdhāyur jīvite punaḥ) 12. 148. 11; (12) Parāśara told Janaka that more than bathing in the water of Puṣkara one should practise (lit. bathe in) austerities at the Puṣkaras (puṣkareṣu) and other holy places (adbhyo bhūyaḥ plāvyaṁ tapasā vai śarīram) 12. 286. 37; (13) Puṣkara considered as the holy place of the mid-region (pṛthivyāṁ naimiṣam puṇyam antarikṣe ca puṣkaram) 3. 81. 173; (however, Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 83. 202: antarikṣe sūryacandrādimārge nakṣatrādicakre puṣkaraṁ prāpayatīty arthaḥ); (also see the section 

  G.   Importance and 

  H.   Simile below and section 

  C.   Epic events (2) and (3) above); 

  F.   Limitations: (i) Giving gifts of horses in very large numbers and of thousands of cows to the Brāhmaṇas at the Puṣkara (puṣkareṣu) was highly meritorious no doubt; (daśāyutāni cāśvānām ayutāni ca viṁśatim/puṣkareṣu dvijātibhyaḥ prādāṁ gāś ca sahasraśaḥ); but that was not enough to enable one to reach the Brahmaloka--this is what Bhagīratha told Brahman 13. 106. 11; (ii) Sprinkling one's body with the water of the Puṣkara is not necessary for one who listens to the Bhārata (yo bhārataṁ samadhigacchati vācyamānaṁ kiṁ tasya puṣkarajalair abhiṣecanena) 1. 2. 242 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 2. 392: puṣakaraṁ āditīrthaṁ śuṇḍāgraṁ vā tadupāhṛtajalaiḥ); 

  G.   Importance: (1) Puṣkara is the first among the tīrthas as Madhusūdana is among all gods (yathā surāṇām sarveṣām ādis tu madhusūdanaḥ/tathaiva puṣkaraṁ rājaṁs tīrthānām ādir ucyate) 3. 80. 55; (2) It is not easy to go to the Puṣkara, not easy to perform austerities there or to give gifts there; to be able to live there is extremely difficult (duṣkaraṁ puṣkaraṁ gantuṁ duṣkaraṁ puṣkare tapaḥ/duṣkaraṁ puṣkare dānaṁ vastuṁ caiva suduṣkaram//) 3. 80. 58; (3) Finds mention in the DaivataṚṣi-Vaṁśa 13. 151. 14, 2. 

  H.   Simile: The entrance of the Kurukṣetra is as holy as the Puṣkaras (kurukṣetrasya tad dvāram …saṁmite puṣkarāṇāṁ ca) 3. 81. 20-21. [See  Pitāmahasaras ]

  Daughter of the frog king Āyu 3. 190. 37; she was once seen by the Ikṣvāku king Parikṣit of Ayodhyā while he had gone for hunting; she had assumed the form of an extremely beautiful girl and attracted the king by her sweet voice; when she informed the king that she was a maiden (kanyāsmi 3. 190. 13), he expressed his desire to marry her; she gave her consent on condition (samaya 3. 190. 15, 16) that she should not be shown water; the king agreed and stayed with her and took her to his town; he sported with her in isolation and did not attend to anything else; the king then lived with her in a large forest which was without water (vanam idam udāram anudakam 3. 190 23); it was got ready for him by his minister; once while sporting with her the king became thirsty; they saw a well full of water; when asked by the king to descend into the wellwater, Suśobhanā entered it and disappeared; when the king did not see her, he got the well emptied and saw a frog at the mouth of a hole; the angred king ordered the killing of all the frogs; when the frog king Āyu, in the form of a hermit, requested Parikṣit not to kill the innocent frogs he said that they had eaten up his beloved; the frog king then informed king Parikṣit that his beloved was his (Āyu's) daughter Suśobhanā who had cheated many kings before; this was her bad character (tasyā dauḥśīlyam etat 3. 190. 37); king Parikṣit told Āyu that he wanted Suśobhanā and that she might be given back to him; Āyu gave Suśobhanā to Parikṣit and asked her to serve the king; he cursed his daughter that since she had cheated kings her children will not be good to Brāhmaṇas due to her falsehood (abrahmaṇyāni tavāpatyāni bhaviṣyanty anṛtakatvāt tava 3. 190. 40); the king having got back Suśobhanā felt as if be had obtained the overlordship of the three worlds; Suśobhanā later gave birth to three sons Śala, Dala and Bala 3. 190. 3-43.

  A.   Residence: She lived for a long time in the inner apartments (antaḥpuravāsinī) of king Brahṃadatta Kāmpilya 12. 137. 5. 

  B.   Qualities: Although born in the lower species she knew everything; she was conversant with dharma and, like a jīvajīvaka (a bird who helps telling future ?; one who prophesies with the help of such a bird ? Nīla jīvajīvakaḥ śākunikaḥ sa hi ayaṃ pakṣī asyāṁ diśi lābhaṁ asyām alābhaṁ diśatīti varṇayati/pakṣiviśesa ity anye on 12. 139. 6 Bom. Ed.), understood the meaning of the cries of all beings (rutajñā sarvabhūtānāṁ yathā vai jīvajīvakaḥ) 12. 137. 6. 

  C.   Her son's death: Her lustrous son grew in the palace with the king's son. Pūjanī used to get from the seashore two fruits, one for her son and one for the prince; one day the prince, while playing with the young bird, killed him in a secluded place; when Pūjanī returned with two fruits she found her young one dead; she lamented over her son's loss and blamed the Kṣatriyas who deserved no trust; she decided to take revenge and pierced the eyes of the prince with her talons; she said that a sinful act, deliberately committed, returned quickly on the doer and that taking revenge did not destroy one's good and bad (?) acts (icchayaiva kṛtaṁ pāpaṁ sadya evopasarpati/ kṛtapratikriyaṁ teṣāṁ na naśyati śubhāśubham) 12. 137. 7-19. 

  D.   King Brahmadatta's dialogue with Pūjanī: Brahmadatta asked Pūjanī to continue to live with him since she had already retaliated for the misdeed of the prince; Pūjanī did not agree with the king saying that wise men recommended abandoning the place where misdeed was committed; enmities, once arisen, never subsided, hence no trust should be reposed in the enemy; the purpose for which she lived in the palace was no longer there; spirited men should abandon the place where after receiving honour they are dishonoured; she said to the king: “I have lived here long enough; now I go, may you be happy” 12. 137. 21-30; the king pleaded with her saying that when some one retaliated nothing wrong was committed and therefore Pūjanī should stay on; Pūjanī did not consent saying that enmities never passed off (nāsti vairam upakrāntam 12. 137. 34); no one should feel secure with the thought that reconciliation had come about; she pointed out to the king five causes of enmity: women, (ownership of) house, (bad) speech, rivalry, and misdeed (strīkṛtaṁ vāstujaṁ vāgjaṁ sasapatnāparādhajam 12. 137. 38); she lived with the king as long as nothing wrong happened; once that happened, she could trust the king no more; the king then put the entire responsibility of what had happened on Time (Kāla); since men were driven to act by Time nobody did anything wrong to any one; he had forgiven Pūjanī for her act, so should she forgive him for what (the prince) had done; Pūjanī retorted saying that if Kāla was to be blamed for everything, why did men seek to take revenge ? Why did Gods and Asuras fight with each other ? Why did men give and take medicines during illness ? She injured the king's son who had killed her son; now it was the king's turn to capture her; men wanted birds either for eating or for sporting; there was no third ground for the two to come together; if Pūjanī were to stay their enmity would be revived every time she remembered her son; she then recited two gāthās which Uśanas had recited for Prahrāda (12. 137. 67-68); the purport of the gāthās was that one who trusted the words of enemies was killed like a honey (-seeker ?) who was killed in a well) covered with dry grass (te śraddadhānā vadhyante madhu śuṣkatṛṇair yathā/ Nī. śatruṇā darśitaṃ puraḥsthitaṃ madhu śraddadhānā śuṣkatṛṇaiś channe prapāte yathā patanti tadvad ete ity arthaḥ on 12. 139. 71 Bom. Ed.); enmities continued because they were told to successive generations; when Brahmadatta further argued that trust had to be placed somewhere to achieve one's objective or else one would live like a dead person, Pūjanī replied that if a person continued to run with injured feet, his feet got more hurt; she gave the king a long lecture on how one should guard one's interest by remaining alert and with constant exertion; one should leave the place where one was dishonoured; since Brahmadatta's son had done something which could not be repaired she had to leave the place; she also lectured on the king's duties (offering protection to subjects and not torturing them by levying heavy taxes); having said all that Pūjanī left (12. 137. 70-108); this conversation (saha bhāṣītam) between Brahmadatta and Pūjanī narrated by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira (12. 137. 4-109).

*4th word in right half of page p437  (+offset) in original book.Śakula  : m.: A kind of fish.

  Three of them, friends of one another, lived together in a shallow pond which abounded in fish; one of them was characterized as Prāptakālajña ‘who knows the proper time (for action), who has the presence of mind’ (also called Saṁpratipattijña, Pratipattimant, or Saṁpratipattimant 12. 135. 9, 13, 15), the other as Dīrghadarśin ‘who has forethought’, and the third as Dīrghasūtra ‘who procrastinates’; seeing, once, the water level falling down, Dīrghadarśin apprehended danger and told his friends that they had better quickly move out before their way to get out was cut off; Dīrghasūtra agreed with him but saw no reason to make haste; Saṁpratipattijña, however, said that he would not fail to take the correct course when time arrived; then Dīrghadarśin, of great intelligence, went out alone to a deep lake following a water current; when the water in the lake had thoroughly flown out the fishermen began to catch the fish by various means; Dīrghasūtra got caught with others; when the fish that were caught were being tied to strings, Pratipattimant got himself mixed with those that were tied already and he held the string tight with his mouth (and thus escaped being actually tied by the string); when the fish, thus tied, were being washed in dirt-free water, Saṁprattimant gave up the string and escaped; the dull-witted and of low intelligence Dīrghasūtra, however, invited death on himself; thus one who does not recognize the most opportune time is destroyed like Dīrghasūtra; one like Saṁpratipattimant, who does not provide for his welfare in advance thinking himself to be clever, meets with danger; who, like Dīrghadarśin, adopts proper course before the danger sets in, attains great bliss; this excellent ākhyāna (ākhyānam anuttamam 12. 135. 1) pertaining to the subject of deciding what should be done and what not was related by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira 12. 135. 1-19.

*7th word in right half of page p13  (+offset) in original book.Śeṣa  : m.: A mythical serpent (nāga 1. 32. 24 (= Ananta); 1. 61. 91; 3. 194. 9, 10, 14; 5. 101. 2; bhujaṁgama 1. 32. 14), sometimes identified with Ananta; living in Bhogavatī Purī 5. 101. 1, 2. 

  A.   Birth and divine origin: Mentioned by Sūta as the first son of Kadrū, the second being Vāsuki (śeṣaḥ prathamato jāto vāsukis tadanantaram 1. 31. 5; hence called bhujagavarāgraja ‘elder brother of the excellent serpent’ (i. e. of Vāsuki) 1. 32. 22; listed as a kādraveya (son of Kadrū, daughter of Dakṣa) along with Ananta, Vāsuki and others 1. 59. 40; Bhīṣma told Duryodhana that Vāsudeva Janārdana created the divine Śeṣa who is known as Ananta 6. 63. 10. 

  B.   Epithets and Description: adorable (bhagavant) 1. 32. 2; lord (prabhu) 1. 32. 5, (prabhur bhuvaḥ) 1. 32. 22; to whom dharma is god (dharmadeva) 1. 32. 23; firm in truth (satyadhṛti) 1. 32. 6; of infinite coils (anantabhoga) 1. 32. 23; of boundless lustre (amitatejas) 3. 194. 9; of great vigour (mahaujas) 6. 63. 11; excellent among serpents (pannagottama) 1. 32. 16, (nāgottama) 1. 32. 23, (bhujaṁgamottama) 1. 32. 21, (pannagaśreṣṭha) 7. 69. 48; described as ‘high as white mountain, wearing various ornaments, his tongues being like flames of fire, and of great strength’ (śvetoccayanibhākāro nānāvidhavibhūṣaṇaḥ/… jvālājihvo mahābalaḥ) 5. 101. 3; the big white snake issuing from the mouth of Balarāma is described as ‘having a thousand heads, having an expanse like that of a mountain, and having a red face’ (sahasraśīrṣaḥ parvatābhogavarṣmā/raktānanaḥ) where apparently Śeṣa is meant, but is not directly named 16. 5. 12-13. 

  C.   Śeṣa's austerities and meeting with Brahmadeva: Śesa deserted his mother Kadrū and visited the slopes of the Himālayas; there on the Gandhamādana mountain and in Badarī, as also at other holy places like Gokarṇa, Puṣkarāraṇya and in various tīrthas and holy abodes (āyataneṣu 1. 32. 4) Śeṣa practised severe austerities living on wind and observing difficult vows; he lived all alone and had controlled his senses (ekāntaśīlī, vijitendriyaḥ 1. 32. 4); during the austerities he put on bark garments and wore matted hair; his flesh, skin and sinews dried up; when Pitāmaha Brahman, saw Śeṣa in this condition he asked him to do something beneficial to the people instead of tormenting them by his severe austerities; he asked Śeṣa the reason for undertaking the austerities; Śeṣa told Pitāmaha that his serpent brothers were dull-witted; they envied each other and did not suffer either Vinatā or her son (Vainateya Garuḍa) who was their cousin; they hated Garuḍa; Śeṣa therefore did not want to see his brothers nor live with them; Śeṣa undertook austerities to give up his body and to avoid the company of his brothers in the next life; he asked Pitāmaha's permission to do that 1. 32. 5-12; Brahman told Śeṣa that his brothers faced danger because they had offended their mother but that incident had been taken care of; since Śeṣa was devoted to righteousness (diṣṭyā ca buddhir dharme te 1. 32. 16), Pitāmaha offered him a boon 1. 32. 13-16; Śeṣa desired to find pleasure in righteousness (dharma), equanimity (śama), and austerity (tapas) 1. 32. 17. 

  D.   Śeṣa as supporter of the earth: Brahman was pleased with Śeṣa's self-control and equanimity and asked him to collect the earth properly and hold it so that it became steady for the benefit of the creatures; Śeṣa agreed to do what Brahman desired and asked Brahman to place the earth on his head; Brahman asked him to go below the earth for which earth would provide an opening (vivara) 1. 32. 21-22; Śeṣa entered the earth through a cleft and held the divine (devī) earth, girdled by the oceans, after enclosing it on all sides; he made the earth firm 1. 32. 19-22; 5. 101. 2; 6. 63. 10; 7. 69. 48; for this feat of holding the earth Śeṣa compared with Brahman or with Balabhid (Indra) 1. 32. 23; (here called nāga Ananta) dwells all alone below the earth 1. 32. 24; Brahman gave to Śeṣa Vainateya Suparṇa (i. e. Garuḍa) as his friend 1. 32. 25. 

  E.   Association with Viṣṇu Nārāyaṇa: Nārāyaṇa told Mārkaṇḍeya that he, having become Śeṣa, supports the earth surrounded by the four oceans and adorned by Meru and Mandara 3. 187. 10; when the entire creation, both moving and non-moving, gets lost in one single ocean, god Viṣṇu Nārāyaṇa sleeps alone on the bed of water on the huge body of Śeṣa; at that time with Śeṣa's great coil Viṣṇu encompasses the whole earth and sustains it 3. 194. 8-10; Hari Nārāyaṇa when he is in his nidrāyoga also sleeps on the bed in the form of the body of the snake (Śeṣa not named here) which is arranged on water 12. 335. 57-58, 17. 

  F.   Śeṣa's place in the four vyūhas of the Pāñcarātra system: Nārāyaṇa told Nārada that his fourth form (mūrti) created imperishable (avyaya) Śeṣa who is known as Saṁkarṣaṇa; from him was created Pradyumna 12. 326. 68; jīva is called Śeṣa Saṁkarṣaṇa 12. 326. 35. 

  G.   Other features of his eminence: (1) A jīva, before attaining siddhi (12. 271. 44) passes through various courses before he reaches the undecaying and infinite place of Viṣṇu, Brahman, Śeṣa, and Nara 12. 271. 50; (2) Droṇa while blessing Duryodhana says: “May Śeṣa, the eminent among the serpents, grant well being (svasti) to you” 7. 69. 48; (3) Baladeva was the incarnation of a portion of Śeṣa 1. 61. 91; (4) He with other snakes came to greet Arjuna's birth 1. 114. 60.
