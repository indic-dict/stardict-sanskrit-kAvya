<H>FOREWORD
<P>It was but natural that, with the advance of scientific Indology, the need should
<>have been urgently felt for a critical edition of the {%Maha1bha1rata.%} In a paper
<>presented at the 11th International Congress of Orientalists held at Paris in 1897,
<>WINTERNITZ strongly voiced this need for a critical edition of the {%Maha1bha1rata%} as “a
<>{%sine qua non%} for all historical and critical research regarding the great epic of India”.
<>As the result of the persistent efforts in this regard of WINTERNITZ and several other
<>scholars, the International Union of Academies resolved in 1904 to undertake the prepara-
<>tion of such an edition. Funds were raised for this purpose, and a specimen of the
<>edition prepared by LU7DERS was also published for private circulation among scholars.
<>But then came the first world war which interrupted all scholastic activities in the West.
<>On the other hand, during the last years of the first world war, there began to become
<>evident in India a new spirit of independence which touched almost all spheres of
<>national life. Accordingly, the workers of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute,
<>which was founded in 1917 to commemorate the name and work of Ramakrishna Gopal
<>BHANDARKAR who had worthily come to be regarded as one of the leading pioneers of
<>scientific Orientology in India, decided, in their understandable enthusiasm, to venture
<>upon the project of a critical edition of the {%Maha1bha1rata%} making a fresh start, of course
<>with the collaboration, wherever possible, of their foreign colleagues.
<P>The first volume in the Institute's {%Critical Edition of the Maha1bha1rata,%} namely,
<>the {%A1diparvan,%} edited by V. S. SUKTHANKAR, was published in 1933, and it soon
<>evoked quite an encouraging response. The critical edition of the eighteen {%parvans%} of
<>the {%Maha1bha1rata%} (extending over 13,000 demi quarto pages) was completed in 1966,
<>and this historic event was formally announced by Rashtrapati Dr. S. RADHAKRISHNAN
<>at a special function held at the Institute on September 22, 1966.
<P>It would seem that the Editorial Board and the Board of Referees for the
<>{%Critical Edition of the Maha1bha1rata%} had visualized it as a multifaceted project. Besides
<>the critical edition of the 18 {%parvans,%} it was to have comprised also a critical edition
<>of the {%Harivam3s4a,%} which is traditionally regarded as a {%khilaparvan%} of the {%Maha1bha1rata,%}
<>(later published in two volumes containing 1,711 pages, 1969-1971), the {%Prati1ka-
<>Index%} (6 volumes containing 4,805 pages, 1967-1972), the {%Critically Constituted Text
<>of the Great Epic and the Harivam3s4a%} (5 volumes containing 3,150 pages, 1971-
<>1976), and the {%Epilogue of the Critical Edition of the Maha1bha1rata.%} This last
<>item, namely, the {%Epilogue,%} has had rather a chequered career. Even at an early
<>stage, it was thought that, as a prelude to the {%Epilogue,%} the Institute should publish a
<>fairly comprehensive analytical {%Cultural Index to the Critical Edition.%} This latter too
<>posed many problems, but the Institute duly overcame them. The work is now properly [Page00-07+ 8]
<>organized, and it is hoped that the present first fascicule of the {%Cultural Index,%} which
<>the Institute has great pleasure in bringing out on the occasion of its {%Amr2tamahotsava,%}
<>will be followed by the subsequent fascicules in quick and regular succession.

<HS>R. N. Dandekar [Page00-08+ 39]
<P>In 1966 the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute completed its monumental
<>project of preparing and publishing the first ever critical edition of the {%Maha1bha1rata%}
<F>1. It has appeared in 19 volumes. The critical edition of the {%Harivam3s4a,%} which is regarded
<>as a {%khilaparvan%} of the {%Maha1bha1rata,%} appeared in two volumes in 1969.</F>,
<>a project on which three General Editors and seven {%parvan-%} Editors had steadily worked
<>for nearly half a century. In continuation of this major task the Institute subsequently
<>brought out two significant publications which went a long way in facilitating the use
<>of the critically edited text: (1) {%The Prati1ka-Index of the Maha1bha1rata,%} being
<>a comprehensive index of the verse-quarters ({%s4lokapa1dasu1ci1%}) occurring in the
<>edition of the {%Maha1bha1rata,%} i. e. verse-quarters which are included in the critically
<>constituted text as well as those which form part of the passages regarded as interpola-
<>tions and which appear either as starred passages in the footnotes or in the appendices.
<>This {%Prati1ka-Index%} appeared in six volumes and took as many years for its com-
<>pletion (1967-1972)
<F>2) The {%Prati1ka-Index%} to the {%Harivam3s4a%} which forms part of the 6th volume of the above
<>edition, however, does not take into account the interpolated passages but is restricted only
<>to the critical text.</F>; and (2) A handy edition of the {%Maha1bha1rata%} giving only the
<>critically constituted text and omitting the critical apparatus and the interpolated
<>passages. It appeared in four volumes (1971-1975)
<F>3) Similar edition of the {%Harivam3s4a%} appeared as volume 5 of this edition in 1976.</F>.
<P>Long before the completion of the work on the critical edition in all respects
<>in 1975, the idea of writing an Epilogue to the {%Maha1bha1rata%} had taken root. In the
<>Annual Report of the Institute for the year 1951-52 (p. 3) we find for the first time,
<>under the activities of the Post-graduate and Research Department of the Institute, a
<>mention of a research project relating to the Epilogue of the {%Maha1bha1rata%} which the
<>University of Poona had undertaken to finance with an annual grant of Rs. 3000/-.
<F>4) This was continued up to 1973. In the year 1969-70, Prof. Dr. K. R. Karandikar gave a
<>generous donation of Rs. 10,000/- for the Epilogue.</F>
<P>In 1951, Dr. S. K. Belvalkar, the then General Editor of the Critical Edition,
<>published a detailed outline of the scheme of the literary and historical Epilogue to the
<>{%Critical Edition of the Maha1bha1rata.%}
<F>5) Prospectus of the Critical and Illustrated Edition of the Maha1bha1rata, India's Greatest
<>National Epic, including Outline Scheme for the Epilogue, Poona, October 1951, pp. 9-18.</F> The Epilogue, as envisaged by him, was meant
<>to assess “the net gain to Maha1bha1rata scholarship, due to the present edition, on
<>various questions of form, matter and structure that have engaged for over a hundred
<>years generations of scholars in and outside India…
<F>6. Op. cit. p. 9.</F>”
<P>The Epilogue, as outlined by Dr. Belvalkar, had to deal with the following
<>subjects: (1) Nature and characteristics of the various versions of the epic: [Page00-09+ 42]
<>(2) Origin and evolution of the Maha1bha1rata, determining the extent and authorship of
<>each stage; (3) Study of the archaisms and neologisms in grammar, metre, syntax
<>and vocabulary; (4) Study of the contents of the repetitions in the epic and of those
<>which it shares with the Ra1ma1yan2a, the other Pura1n2as, and some of the older Smr2ti
<>texts; (5) Stylistic study and study of passages marked for their delineation of
<>passions and portrayal of characters with a view to determining unity of authorship;
<>(6) Interpretation of the epic-whether or not the kernel of the story is a historical
<>event and determination of the calendar of events in the story; (7) Study of geogra-
<>phical and cosmographical data and investigation of astronomical statements; (8) Investi-
<>gation of the allusions to the flora and fauna and, related to it, the state of agriculture
<>and transport, industry and commerce; dress, diet and domestic hygiene; arts (music,
<>dancing, painting etc.); crafts (carpentry, manufacture of ornaments and the like,
<>etc.); medicine, alchemy and astronomy; warfare (manufacture and use of arms,
<>military tactics, etc.); architecture; sports (hunting, gambling, etc); (9) Study of social
<>organisation; (10) Study of the system of education, and (11) of Ra1jani1ti or the
<>Science and Art of Governance-comparison with the Dharmas4a1stras, the Arthas4a1stra,
<>and the Ni1tis4a1stras; (12) Study of the statements on different systems of philosophy
<>like Sa1m3khya, Yoga, Pa1s4upata, Pa1n5cara1tra and the like; (13) Interpretation in their
<>togetherness and unity of the several statements in the epic on the personality and
<>teachings of Lord S4ri1kr2s2n2a; (14) Answering the question whether the Maha1bha1rata is
<>a literary product with a purpose of its own and, if so, determining the social, cultural
<>and philosophical background it offered for its ethico-philosophical {%obiter dicta;%} (15) The
<>position of the Bhagavadgi1ta1; (16) The date of the Maha1bha1rata, i. e. the date of
<>the Bha1rata war, of the first composition describing that event, of the Jaya, of the
<>Bha1rata and of the Maha1bha1rata; (17) The position of the Maha1bha1rata as the
<>“Fifth Veda” which was looked upon as an authority by the new S4a1straka1ras; (18)
<>Listing of typical illustrations from the critical apparatus explaining the types of
<>mistakes made by copyists and the emendations made by the students and Pandits;
<>(19) Preparation of a complete Bibliography, glossary of important words used in
<>unusual connotation, a Register of Proper Names, and an adequate General Index.
<P>Accordingly, Shri S. K. Dikshit was the first scholar to be appointed to do some
<>spade work for the project on the Epilogue for a couple of years (1951-53). The
<>project was then shifted from the post-graduate and Research Department
<>to the Maha1bha1rata Department of the Institute
<F>1) Of which it forms part till today.</F> and Shri G. B. Palsule continued
<>for a few months the work initiated by Shri Dikshit. Later, Shri D. B. Diskalkar
<>and Shri M. T. Sahasrabuddhe were formally appointed as Research Fellows for the
<>Epilogue Project, and “The general lines of the procedure to be followed [for the
<>Epilogue] were laid down by the Maha1bha1rata Department”.
<F>2. Institute's Annual Report for the year 1953-54, p. 12.</F> These two scholars left
<>the Institute after working for two years and in 1955 their work in the Epilogue project
<>was taken up by Acharya Shri V. P. Limaye, Dr. Smt. Kunda Sathe, and Prof. S. N. [Page00-10+ 43]
<>Banhatti. These scholars, however, did not continue for more than a year, and in 1956
<>Shri V. M. Bedekar was appointed in the Project. Shri Bedekar carried on the work
<>for the Epilogue under the guidance, first of the General Editor, and then of the
<>Director (or Superintendent) of the Maha1bha1rata Department, for over twenty-two
<>long years (up to 3-1-1978). Initially Shri Bedekar wrote a number of papers
<>on various subjects related to the {%Maha1bha1rata%} which he felt would be useful for
<>writting the Epilogue. He also wrote pp. ccv to ccxlvii of the Introduction to the
<>Critical Edition of the S4a1ntiparvan.
<F>1) See Postscript by P. L. Vaidya, Critical Edition Vol. 16, p. ccxlviii.</F>
<P>In 1969 the Institute decided to undertake the preparation of the Cultural Index
<>to the {%Maha1bha1rata%}
<F>2) Its first mention occurs in the Institute's Annual Report for the year 1970-71, p. 10.</F> as a work preparatory to the writing of the Epilogue. The
<>necessity of having some kind of an Index to the {%Maha1bha1rata%} was felt since long.
<>This was pointedly expressed by M. Winternitz while reviewing
<F>3) {%ZDMG%} 64. 241-243, 1910.</F> the first four parts of
<>S. So7rensen's {%An Index to the Names in the Maha1bha1rata (with short explanations).%}
<>Winternitz reports that his unforgettable teacher Bu7hler often used to make heavy demands
<>on his pupils with a view to encouraging them to achiever maximum possible performance.
<>Some of these demands could be quite astonishing (frappierend). For example, Bu7hler,
<>on a certain occasion, told Winternitz: “Please look up, that occurs in the Maha1bha1-
<>rata”. But that was not easy to do. For, asks Winternitz, at a time when not
<>even P. C. Roy's translation
<F>4) This should really read “Kesari Mohan Ganguli's translation”. See the Preface to the
<>fourth edition, 1981, published by Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi.</F> of the Maha1bha1rata (1st edn. 1883-1896) was available,
<>nor the Register to A. Holtzmann's {%Das Maha1bha1rata und seine Teile%} (4 volumes
<>1892-1895), nor H. Jacobi's {%Maha1bha1rata: Inhaltsangabe, Index und Concordanz
<>der calcuttaer und bombayer Ausgaben%} (1903), was available, where was a young
<>beginner of Sanskrit studies to “look up” and find out a particular reference in the
<>enormous confused mass (in dem ungeheuren Wust) of a hundred thousand stanzas of
<>the great epic that Maha1bha1rata is ?
<P>With the publication of the three works noted above many things could be
<>traced to the {%Maha1bha1rata,%} but not all. Ganguli's translation was not an Index. The
<>second volume of Holtzmann's {%Das Maha1bha1rata und seine Teile%} which is entitled
<>{%Die Teile des Gedichtes%} and which appeared in 1893, gives the contents of the {%Maha1-
<>bha1rata%} and the {%Harivam3s4a%} and is provided with a Register at the end to cover all
<>the four volumes of the book. Similarly Jacobi's work on the {%Maha1bha1rata%} gives the
<>contents of the text (pp. 1-192), along with an Index of proper names (pp. 193-240),
<>and a concordance of the texts as they appear in the Calcutta and the Bombay editions
<>(pp. 242-257). Both these works,
<F>5) A similar book, {%The Maha1bha1rata--Analysis and Index%} by Edward P. Rice, appeared in
<>1934. It claims to be a {%map%} to the ‘Jungle’ of information that the {%Maha1bha1rata%} offers.</F> useful no doubt in their times,
<F>6) Jacobi notes that his work was to be useful not only to a layman but also to a specialist
<>as a town-map is indispensable even to a long resident of a big town. (Preface p. III).</F> served only a [Page00-11+ 40]
<>limited purpose since both of them were based on the statements about the contents of
<>the epic made by the respective authors in their works. What was required, as
<>Winternitz noted in his review, was an Index based on {%the text of the Maha1-
<>bha1rata itself.%}
<P>This need was admirably fulfilled by S. So7rensen's {%Index to the names in the
<>Maha1bha1rata%} which appeared in 1925 (reprint 1963). The utility of So7rensen's Index
<>is manifold and is not to be doubted.
<F>1) For the merits So7rensen's Index, see Winternitz, op. cit. p. 242.</F> It registers names of persons and mythological
<>beings and their epithets, as well as names of peoples, place names, names of weapons,
<>and the titles of {%parvans%} and {%a1khya1nas%} along with the summaries of their contents.
<P>So7rensen's Index was based on the Calcutta edition of the epic which, in the
<>absence of a critical edition, was probably the best thing to do. However, in 1910,
<>while writing his review, Winternitz raised the question whether it was worthwhile to
<>undertake the preparation of an Index based on any particular version of the epic when
<>its critical edition, as then envisaged by the European scholars, was under preparation.
<>He, himself, however, answered the question in the affirmative, realizing full well the
<>enormous difficulties that lay in the way of completing the task. Winternitz proved to be
<>right. As it happened, the European undertaking had to come to a standstill during the first
<>world war, and it was never taken up again thereafter. The Indian enterprise began in
<>1919 and took nearly half a century for its completion. The present {%Cultural Index,%}
<>work on which may be said to have started around 1969, has just begun to appear.
<>So7rensen's Index, the first parts of which appeared during 1904-1908, has thus
<>served the needs of scholars for nearly a century.
<P>With the publication of the {%Critical Edition of the Maha1bha1rata%} (Poona, 1933
<>-1966), the need was again felt for an Index which would be based on the critically
<>constituted text and which would not be restricted only to the proper names of all sorts
<>but would cast its net wide so as to cover all aspects of Indian Culture. Shri Bedekar,
<>then the lone hand in the Epilogue department of the Institute, started extracting
<>relevant material from several {%parvans%} during the year 1969-70. Shri Bedekar thus may
<>be said to have really started the work of collecting material for the Cultural Index to
<>the Maha1bha1rata.
<P>In 1971, Shri Bedekar began to be assisted in his work of extracting material by
<>Smt. Vijaya Deshmukh. The material collected by these two scholars pertained to
<>personal names, names of gods and mythological beings, geographical names, and many
<>other aspects of Indian Culture. It was collected both from the critically constituted
<>text as well as the starred passages available in the foot-notes of the critical edition.
<P>After the sad demise of Shri Bedekar in January 1978, Dr. V. G. Rahurkar
<>joined the Institute as Research Professor
<F>2) Dr. G. K. Bhat also worked as a Research Professor for the Epilogue for a short period
<>of three months (June-August 1979).</F> for Epilogue and carried on the work of [Page00-12+ 40]
<>collecting material for the Index. Dr. Rahurkar and Dr. (Smt.) Vijaya Deshmukh
<>continued this work till 1983.
<P>In 1983 the first stage for the preparation of the Index was reached when the work
<>of collecting the material from all the eighteen {%parvans%} was completed. Before this, a
<>scheme of classification of the Index Cards (totalling about a lakh and fifty thousand)
<>according to different subjects noted by Dr. Belvalkar in his Outline given above,
<>was also drawn up by the Maha1bha1rata Department. It was then broadly envisaged by
<>the Department that the Index material would fall into six major heads like: 1. Names;
<>2. Events; 3. Concepts--(a) philosophical, (b) religious, (c) political, (d)
<>social, (e) fine arts and crafts, (f) science and technology; 4. Realia--(a) per-
<>sonal (dress, cosmetics, and the like), (b) day-to-day life (food, drink, games, etc.),
<>(c) habitation (buildings, forts, and the like), (d) war (subjects like arms, weapons,
<>{%vyu1has,%} etc.), (e) agriculture, (f) other professions (trades in articles, specialized
<>trades), (g) animals (customs and beliefs associated with them), (h) social life
<>(customs and manners, superstitions, and the like), (i) valuable articles (minerals,
<>stones, precious wood, and the like); 5. Geography; 6. Divisions of time.
<P>In August 1983, Dr. M. A. Mehendale joined the Bhandarkar Institute as the
<>Editor of the Epilogue.
<F>1) The need for the appointment of a full-time Editor for the Epilogue was already expressed
<>as early as 1968 (Institute's Annual Report for 1968-69, p. 11).</F> With the assistance of Dr. Rahurkar and Dr. Deshmukh, he
<>started the work on the second stage, i. e. the classification of the cards under the main
<>six heads indicated above. It was soon discovered that as far as the interpolated pas-
<>sages were concerned, the material was collected only from the short starred passages in
<>the foot-notes to the critical edition, but the long interpolated passages appearing in the
<>appendices to several {%parvans%} had remained untouched. It was therefore decided to restrict
<>the present Cultural Index to the critically constituted text. Dr. Rahurkar left in 1986
<>while he was still dealing with the cards of the Udyogaparvan. Dr. P. D. Navathe,
<>the Curator of the Manuscripts Department of the Institute, was then requested to
<>complete and check the work on the Udyogaparvan. He readily agreed and completed
<>the work in his spare time over the years. During the next period of five years (1987-
<>1992) a number of scholars were appointed for the work of classifying the cards which
<>they did for a shorter or a longer period varying from six months to three years. These
<>scholars included
<F>2) Shri Achyutananda Dash worked only for two months in 1987.</F> Shri P. C. Sahoo, Dr. D. V. Garge, Shri S. K. Pani, Smt. Jayanti
<>Tripathi, Smt. Sucheta Paranjape, Smt. Svaruchi Joshi and Shri N. B. Marathe. Of
<>these, only Shri Marathe still continues to work for the Cultural Index.
<P>The work on the second stage of classifying the cards under the major heads
<>was completed in 1992. In the meantime, Dr. Mehendale published “A Tentative
<>Specimen Fascicule of the Cultural Index to the Maha1bha1rata” in the {%Annals%} of the
<>Institute, Vol. LXVI (1985), pp. 117-152. This was done with a view to giving some [Page00-13+ 38]
<>concrete shape to the work on the Index that was going on over the years. The fasci-
<>cule was styled “Tentative” because it was attempted at a time when not all the
<>cards on the various entries included in the Specimen Fascicule were available to
<>the author.
<P>The stage was now set for a further internal classification of the cards, which
<>then fell into six main divisions, and their alphabetization. This was taken up in the
<>early months of 1992 by Shri Marathe, Dr. Deshmukh and Dr. Mehendale, when Dr.
<>R. N. Dandekar suggested to Mehendale that a beginning might be made to write out
<>the final entries of the Index and publish them as a first fascicule. A suitable occasion
<>had presented itself by Providence, since on July 6, 1992, the Bhandarkar Oriental
<>Research Institute completed its 75th year of existence, and it was decided by the
<>authorities of the Institute to celebrate 1992-93 as the {%Amr2tamahotsava%} year.
<P>Ideally the publication of the first section of the Cultural Index should have
<>begun with the names of persons, gods and other mythological beings. But the condi-
<>tion of the corpus at that stage was not suitable for this. Hence it was decided to
<>start with smaller sections, material for which could be readily gathered and suitably
<>organized. The choice therefore fell on the names of serpents, birds, etc., to be followed
<>by those of missiles, weapons, etc. In a way this beginning with the names of {%snakes%}
<>and {%missiles%} also can have some justification. The {%Maha1bha1rata,%} as it is available
<>today, is supposed to have been narrated by Su1ta Ugras4ravas, which he, in his turn, had
<>heard at the {%snake%} sacrifice of king Janamejaya. And the basic theme of his narrative
<>centered round the war between the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas which was fought with
<>various {%missiles.%}
<P>The work of writing out the Index-entries for the two sections noted above and
<>seeing them through the press was started by Mehendale leaving the work of further
<>internal classification of the cards and their alphabetization to Shri Marathe and Dr.
<>Deshmukh. In addition to this work, Shri Marathe and Dr. Deshmukh also helped
<>Mehendale in going through the proofs, Shri Marathe specially paying attention to
<>verifying the textual references in the proofs. The result of this work is now being pre-
<>sented to the world of scholars in the form of the first fascicule of the {%Cultural Index.%}
<P>The Index entries hardly require any orientation. However, the following few
<>features may be noted:
<P>1. References, when necessary are given not only for the actual occurrence of
<>a given name, but also to the additional information that may have been supplied for it.
<>For example, of the two references 1. 31. 15, 2 given under the name Akarkara, the first
<>reference (15) indicates the stanza where the name occurs, the second (2) indicates
<>the stanza where it is said that the name Akarkara was listed by Su1ta at the request
<>of S4aunaka. [Page00-14+ 41]
<P>2. The information under each name and the references related to it are given
<>not according to the sequence of the {%parvans%} as, for example, was done by So7rensen,
<>but all the available information is first suitably arranged and then given in a certain
<>order. In the case of longer entries, the arranged information is first classified under
<>certain heads, e. g. the information under Ga1n2d2i1va (pp. 97-103) is classified under
<>such heads as: A Etymology; B. Origin; C. History; D. Association with Arjuna;
<>E. Description; F. Big Sound (produced by it); G. Use by Arjuna; H. Arjuna's
<>vow regarding the bow; I. Comparisons; J. Defeat; K. Return to Varun2a. Where
<>found necessary, the information, first classified under the major heads as above, is
<>further divided into sections and sub-sections, e. g. the information about the use of
<>Brahma1stra given under F. (pp. 123-124) is classified according as: 1. its
<>use in the epic war, and 2. its use outside the epic war; and then again, its use by
<>various heroes such as (i) Dron2a, (ii) Arjuna, (iii) Karn2a etc., and then further
<>(a) (by Dron2a) against Arjuna, (b) against Yudhis2t2hira etc.
<P>3. Information given for a particular name is limited to the actual occurrences
<>of the name in the text. Hence every single incident related to the name is not narrated
<>up to its end but is left when the name does not figure in the further development of the
<>incident, e. g. under the entry Vajra
<F>1) It is only in rare cases like the one of the elephant Suprati1ka of Bhagadatta that references
<>are given although the elephant's name is not specifically stated (p. 71. 2).</F> (pp. 131-137), the incident related to the meeting
<>of Bali and Indra, or the one in which Garud2a and Indra figure (p. 134) are narrated
<>only up to the point where Vajra figures in those incidents and are not told in full.
<P>4. Similarly in the case of an item like Ga1n2d2i1va, Arjuna is very likely to
<>have used this bow on all important occasions after he received it at the time of the
<>burning of the Kha1n2d2ava forest. The information and the references in the Index are,
<>however, limited to the actual occurrences of the name Ga1n2d2i1va in the text of the
<>Maha1bha1rata.
<F>1) It is only in rare cases like the one of the elephant Suprati1ka of Bhagadatta that references
<>are given although the elephant's name is not specifically stated (p. 71. 2).</F>
<P>5. Actual citations from the text are given if it was felt that it would help the
<>reader if he had before him the actual words of the text; or in the case of the {%subha1-
<>s2itas%} (e. g. {%daivenopahato ra1jan…na1nyat tatra para1yan2am%} on p. 7. 2, or {%na hi kas4cit
<>kr2te ka1rye…sa1vas4es2a1n2i ka1rayet%} on p. 38. 2); or in the case of etymologies ({%dhatte
<>dha1rayate cedam etasma1t ka1ran2a1d dhanam%} p. 18. 1), or in the case of unintelligible
<>or doubtful expressions ({%sa1garasya gr2ha1n iva%} p. 31. 2; {%sarpa1n2a1m pragraha1 ya1nti%}
<>p. 32. 2; {%ekas tatra balopeto dhuram udvahate 'dhika1m%} p. 75. 1).
<P>6. Commentator Ni1lakan2t2ha's (Ni1.) view is cited if he has a different opinion
<>(e. g. Krathana according to him is the name of a Yaks2a p. 14. 2); or in support of
<>the meaning adopted of a peculiar word (e. g. {%kr2trimah2 sveccha1sampa1dyah2%} p. 17. 2;
<>{%dravin2avattarau balavattarau%} p. 18. 1; {%tr2n2ara1jas ta1tah2%} p. 99. 1); or if he has a
<>fanciful etymology to suggest, e. g. of Pina1ka p. 116. 2. In all the cases where [Page00-15+ 19]
<>Ni1lakan2t2ha is cited references are also given to the Bombay edition in order to enable
<>the reader to locate Ni1lakan2t2ha's text.
<F>1. Unfortunately these have been missed under the entries As4vakranda (p. 4. 1) and Ulu1ka
<>(p. 6. 1) which in both cases should be: 1. 32. 18 Bom. Ed.</F>
<P>7. There are a few adjectival entries which cannot be strictly called names,
<>e. g. A1sura (pp. 92. 2-93. 1), Ga1ndharva (p. 103. 1-2). These have been included
<>for the sake of completeness. For a similar reason, and also because they have some
<>important information to give, there are entries of some appellative words although the
<>objects denoted by them are not named e. g. Ki1t2a (p. 86, 1); the entries like Paras4u
<>(p. 111. 1), Pa1s4a (p. 113. 2), etc. appear here under the section on Names only so
<>far as they are associated with some definite persons or deities. Where this is not the
<>case their treatment will be found later under the section on weapons.
<P>In the end I have great pleasure in expressing my thankfulness to Dr. R. N.
<>Dandekar for his encouragement and continued interest in the progress of the Project,
<>to my colleagues in the Institute with whom I had the benefit of discussing various
<>points of interpretation, and to the past and present workers in the Epilogue Department.
<>I am also thankful to the Institute's Office and library staff, as also to the Press
<>Staff for bearing with my hand-written sheets of entries.

<>{@A.@} Origin: (a) According to 1. 2. 73
<>the origin is narrated in the A1sti1kaparvan;
<>mind-born ({%sam3kalpaja%}) son of Kas4yapa and
<>Vinata1 (1. 27. 27, hence often called Vaina-
<>teya; also Vinata1tmaja, Vinata1suta, Vinata1-
<>su1nu) 1. 14. 6, 8; 1. 27. 2, 27, 34; 1. 59. 39;
<>1. 60. 67; 5. 103. 10; born from one of the two
<>eggs of Vinata1 placed in a warm pot ({%sopas-
<>veda bha1n2d2a%}) for over a thousand years; as
<>advised by her elder son Arun2a, Vinata1 did not
<>break the egg prematurely 1. 14. 12 14, 19-20;
<>when the proper time came Garud2a came out
<>of the egg without mother's help 1. 20. 4; as
<>soon as born he left the mother and flew up
<>in the sky, from there to seek his destined
<>food (serpents, hence {%pannagasu1dana%}) 1. 14.
<>22-23; as son of Vinata1, he is counted among
<>the six Vainateyas 1. 59. 39; 1. 114. 62;
<>(1. 60. 38); (b) Garud2a born due to the
<>penance of the Va1lakhilyas 1. 27. 27; once
<>Indra disregarded the Va1lakhilyas; so they
<>offered a sacrifice to produce another Indra
<>for gods who would be a hundred times more
<>powerful than the then existing Indra 1. 27. [Page015-b+ 41]
<>8-14; at the intervention of Kas4yapa Praja1-
<>pati, Va1lakhilyas agreed to the proposal that
<>the one to be born as a result of their
<>sacrifice would be the ‘Indra’ of the birds 1.
<>27. 16, 20, 29; hence Garud2a was consecrated
<>as Indra of birds 1. 27. 35; Rudra gave a
<>boon that the Va1lakhilyas will produce by
<>their penance Suparn2a, the bringer of Soma
<>13. 14. 62-63; (c) At birth, Garud2a
<>was of big size ({%maha1ka1yah2%}), having
<>blazing lustre and looking like a mass of
<>kindled fire 1. 20. 5, 7; all people thought
<>him to be fire; gods and sages requested Agni
<>not to burn the people; they were informed
<>by Agni that the mass of fire was Garud2a,
<>Agni's equal in lustre 1. 20. 4-8; gods and
<>sages praised Garud2a, whereupon Garud2a with-
<>drew his lustre 1. 20. 10-14. {@B.@} Progeny:
<>Suparn2as: six sons of Garud2a (Vainateya)
<>Sumukha (6. 7. 12) and others, extended the
<>lineage of Suparn2a; these live in the world of
<>Suparn2as with serpents as their food 5. 99. 1;
<>these six are thus the founders of the {%vinata1-
<>kula%} 5. 99. 3. {@C.@} Eminence: Garud2a com-
<>pared with Pina1kin 1. 28. 20; Upamanyu said
<>that S4iva was Vainateya among the birds 13.
<>14. 158; as the best among the birds he was
<>counted among the Vibhu1tis of Bhagava1n 6.
<>32. 30; Arjuna was like Garud2a among the
<>birds 6. 116. 32; Vainateya never thought
<>highly of other birds whenever he con-
<>fronted them 6. 4. 34. {@D.@} Bringer of {%amr2ta%}
<>(Soma): Some time after his birth Garud2a
<>approached his mother who, as the slave of
<>Kadru1 was on the other side of the ocean;
<>at her instance Vainateya carried on his
<>back serpents near the sun; serpents fainted
<>due to sun's (hot) rays 1. 21. 5-6; when
<>revived at Indra's intervention, Suparn2a
<>carried them to a beautiful forest in an island,
<>and from there to another island 1. 23. 1, [Page016-a+ 41]
<>6-7; Garud2a asked Vinata1 why he must do
<>whatever serpents asked him to do; knowing
<>the reason (Vinata1's slavery), Garud2a asked
<>serpents how his mother could be freed from
<>slavery; serpents asked him to get {%amr2ta%} for
<>them (1. 23. 1-12); before starting on his
<>expedition, Garud2a asked Vinata1 what he
<>might eat on his way; she asked him to eat the
<>Nis2a1das living in Nis2a1da1laya but warned him
<>never to harm a Bra1hman2a; Vinata1 told
<>Garud2a how to recognize a Bra1hman2a; at the
<>time of his departure he was blessed by
<>Vinata1; at Nis2a1da1laya he opened his beak
<>and ate up those that entered it 1. 24. 1-14;
<>a Bra1hman2a and his wife inadvertently got
<>into his beak and burnt his throat; Garud2a
<>opened the beak and let the Bra1hman2a and his
<>wife, a Nis2a1di1, slip out, he was blessed by the
<>Bra1hman2a 1. 25. 1-5; further on his way he
<>met his father Kas4yapa whom he told that he
<>was on his way to get Soma (1. 25. 7; {%amr2ta%}
<>1. 25. 9) and asked what else he might
<>eat; Kas4yapa asked him to eat Suprati1ka,
<>(an elephant) and Vibha1vasu (a tortoise),
<>both of enormous size, and blessed him 1. 25.
<>7-9, 25; Garuda picked up the elephant and
<>the tortoise (who, according to 5. 107. 16, lived
<>in the south and used to fight with each other)
<>with his nails and went to Alambati1rtha and
<>sat on a Rohin2a tree to eat the two; the branch
<>gave way under the tremendous weight 1. 25.
<>27-33; on this branch were the Va1lakhilyas; to
<>save them from destruction Garud2a (Ta1rks2ya
<>1. 26. 18) held the branch in his beak and flew
<>around; not finding a place to rest Garud2a went
<>to his father Kas4yapa on the Gandhama1dana
<>mountain; Kas4yapa told the Va1lakhilyas
<>that Garud2a's endeavour was in the interest
<>of the living beings; they left the branch;
<>Garud2a (Vinata1tmaja 1. 26. 15) asked
<>Kas4yapa to direct him to a place, free from [Page016-b+ 41]
<>Bra1hman2as, where he might leave the branch;
<>as advised, Garud2a went to an uninhabited
<>mountain covered with snow and there ate the
<>elephant and the tortoise 1. 26. 1-16; as
<>Garud2a drew near the place of {%amr2ta,%}
<>there were bad omens for gods; when Indra
<>enquired the reason, Brahaspati told him that
<>Garud2a was arriving to fetch Soma 1. 26.
<>36-37 (called also {%amr2ta%} 1. 26. 38); Br2has-
<>pati told the gods that Garud2a was of in-
<>comparable strength and would achieve what
<>was most difficult to achieve ({%asa1dhyam api
<>sa1dhayet%}) 1. 26. 37; Garud2a (Garutmart
<>1. 28. 1; Vainateya 1. 28. 14; Vinata1suta 1. 28.
<>20) fought with Bhauvana, the protector of
<>Soma (1. 28. 3), with other gods who were
<>protecting {%amr2ta%} (1. 28. 6), an with birds
<>({%paks2in%}) like As4vakranda, Ren2uka and others;
<>he killed these, and put gods to flight; he fought
<>with wings, beak and nails 1. 28. 1-20; after
<>the fight Garud2a saw {%amr2ta%} surrounded
<>by fire; he divided his mouth into ninety
<>times ninety, fetched water in them from rivers,
<>poured it on the fire and pacified it; to enter
<>the fire he became small in size 1. 28.
<>22-25; near the {%amr2ta%} he saw a wheel
<>of iron ({%ayasmaya%}), of sharp edge, which
<>was a device ({%yantra%}) created by gods to
<>cut down those who might try to steal
<>Soma; as he entered through the spokes
<>of the wheel he saw two serpents, with poi-
<>son in their eyes ({%caks2urvis2au%}), guard-
<>ing {%amr2ta;%} anyone seen by them would be
<>reduced to ashes; Suparn2a blinded their eyes
<>with dust and, unseen, he (Vainateya)
<>snatched Soma and flew away quickly; with
<>the force of his speed he uprooted ({%unmath-%})
<>the {%yantra%} 1. 29. 2-10; he himself did not
<>taste the {%amr2ta%} but asked a boon from Vis2n2u
<>that he should become undecaying and im-
<>mortal without tasting {%amr2ta%} 1. 29. 11, 14; [Page017-a+ 41]
<>without going near him Indra struck Garud2a,
<>as he was taking away {%amr2ta,%} with his {%vajra;%}
<>to respect the sage (Dadhi1ca 1. 127. 12) from
<>whose bones the {%vajra%} was fashioned, the {%vajra%}
<>itself, and Indra, Garud2a released a feather
<>from his wings, as though due to the stroke
<>of {%vajra,%} but otherwise was not affected
<>by the {%vajra%} 1. 29. 17-20; seeing the feather
<>of excellent form all beings ({%sarvabhu1ta1ni%})
<>said “may this bird be Suparn2a” ({%suru1pam3
<>patram a1laks2ya suparn2o 'yam3 bhavatv iti%})
<>1. 29. 21; Indra sought Garud2a's friendship,

<>(Kas4yapa had prophesied before Garud2a's
<>birth that he would be the helper of Indra 1.
<>27. 30); Indra requested Garud2a to return
<>Soma, but Garud2a told him the purpose of
<>taking it away; both hatched a plan--
<>Indra was to take away {%amr2ta%} once Garud2a
<>had placed it before the serpents and freed his
<>mother from slavery 1. 30. 7-9; Indra
<>granted Garud2a a boon, and he chose ser-
<>pents to be his food 1. 30. 10-12 (hence his

<>placed it for them on the {%kus4a%} grass; he asked
<>them to take it after they had bathed and
<>become auspicious ({%man3galasam3yukta1h2%}); he
<>asked serpents to free his mother from slavery
<>from that day; the serpents agreed and went
<>to bathe; Garud2a (Suparn2a) was happy to

<>moon-like white horses, each having a black ear
<>on one side (5. 104. 26); not knowing how to

<>to Vis2n2u; just then Garud2a (Vinata1tmaja),

<>offered to take him to any place 5. 105.
<>14-19; Suparn2a described to Ga1lava the four

<>Ga1lava requested Garud2a (named variously

<>Garud2a (Vinata1su1nu) agreed and asked

<>Ga1lava told Garud2a that his real purpose was
<>to obtain the eight hundred horses and since

<>down by Indra and was falling from his lap,

<>performed his duty of drawing the Sun's cha-
<>riot and was permitted by the god to leave;
<>he was then informed by his wife about
<>the arrival of a Bra1hman2a; she informed
<>Padma that the Bra1hman2a had asked him to
<>meet him; Padma's initial reaction, due
<>to his sense of pride, was not to oblige the
<>Bra1hman2a; but on the advice of his wife he
<>relented and met the Bra1hman2a; he then told
<>his wife that he realized that it was not in
<>one's interest to get angry for in bygone days,
<>Ra1van2a, Ka1rtavi1rya and his sons were killed
<>due to their anger 12. 348. 13-17; he appro-
<>ached the Bra1hman2a Dharma1ran2ya and asked
<>him what he wanted 12. 349. 3-4, 9-12; the
<>Bra1hman2a first asked Padma a question; after
<>hearing Padma's answer, the Bra1hman2a would
<>tell Padma the purpose of his visit 12. 349. [Page036-b+ 41]
<>16; the Bra1hman2a asked Padma to tell him if
<>while pulling the god Sun's chariot. he saw
<>anything wonderful on his way 12. 350. 1;
<>Padma first told the Bra1hman2a that there was
<>nothing more wonderful than the Sun himself
<>(accomplished sages and deities resort to his
<>rays; wind resorts to sun's rays and flows

<>Sun takes back the rain water with his shining

<>for all times established in his lustre; he is the
<>seed of everything, movable and immovable
<>and the earth is sustained by him; the long-
<>armed, eternal, unalterable god having no
<>beginning and no end resides in the sun 12.
<>350. 2-7); Padma next told him that one day
<>something unusual happened: while the Sun
<>was shining brightly at mid-day, there
<>suddenly appeared light in all directions, light
<>similar to that of the sun; then, as if tearing
<>open the sky a being, looking like a second Sun
<>({%dviti1ya iva bha1skarah2%} 12. 350. 11), appro-
<>ached the Sun; the Sun held out his hand to
<>receive him and the other being also extended
<>his right hand to hold the Sun's hand; then
<>the being entered the Sun's disc 12. 350. 8-15;
<>confused as to who was the real Sun--the one
<>in the chariot or the one that arrived from the
<>sky--Padma and others asked the Sun to
<>explain; the Sun told them that the one who
<>entered him was a sage who observed the vow
<>of {%un5chavr2tti%} (living only on grains fallen in
<>the field); the sage also lived successively on
<>fruit, roots, fallen leaves, water and air and
<>recited the {%r2c%} stanzas; that Bra1hman2a (sage)
<>even now moved round the earth with the Sun
<>--this was the wonder seen by Padma 12. 351.
<>1-6; the Bra1hman2a Dharma1ran2ya, on hearing [Page037-a+ 39]
<>Padma's account, took leave of him without
<>telling him the purpose of his visit; to the
<>perplexed Padma, Dharma1ran2ya explained
<>that he was only curious to know what led to
<>the accumulation of merit ({%pun2yasam3caya%});
<>now that he knew how one did it, he had
<>decided to observe {%un5chavrata;%} the purpose
<>of his visit was served ({%kr2ta1rtho 'smi%}) and

<>{@C.@} Palita-Lomas4a Episode: Once when
<>the cat Lomas4a who lived on the branches
<>of the same banyan tree was caught in the
<>trap ({%unma1tha%}) fixed by a Ca1n2d2a1la, Palita
<>moved about fearlessly; he got a piece of flesh
<>and as he was eating it after taking it on
<>the top of the trap and smiling mentally
<>({%manasa1 hasan%} 12. 136. 28) at his enemy,
<>trapped below, Palita saw his second enemy,
<>a mongoose by name Harika, approaching
<>the tree and looking up at his prey; Palita
<>at that moment, also saw a third enemy, an
<>owl named Candraka, prowling from his [Page038-a+ 41]
<>nest situated on the branch of the same tree;
<>apprehending danger from both directions,
<>Palita decided to take help from the cat, his
<>foe in distress, and find escape from all the
<>three 12. 136. 26-42; he therefore addressed
<>himself to the cat pointing out that there was
<>danger to the life of both of them, that both
<>lived on the same tree and therefore deserved
<>to be friends of each other on the basis of
<>common residence ({%sava1so me 'si pan2d2itah2
<>vl. pan2d2ita%} 12. 136. 54), that he was prepared
<>to cut the cords that bound the cat provided
<>the cat agreed not to kill him when freed;
<>Palita appealed to the cat: “I wish you live,
<>and you should wish that I live” 12. 136.
<>48-62; the cat agreed to the proposal and
<>asked Palita to do what was suited to the
<>occasion; Palita swore by truth ({%satyena te
<>s4ape%} 12. 136. 73) to cut down the net pro-
<>vided the cat agreed not to kill him when he
<>descended and crawled very close to the body
<>of the cat ({%aham3 tva1nupraveks2ya1mi%} 12.
<>136. 72); when the cat agreed to this, Palita
<>went near the cat and rested quietly on his
<>chest; seeing him safe, the mongoose and the
<>owl returned to their residence 12. 136. 66-82;
<>Palita then started to cut slowly the cords of
<>the net; when the cat asked Palita to finish
<>the work quickly, Palita advised him to be
<>patient; Palita would complete cutting the
<>net only when he saw the Can2d2a1la, who had
<>spread the net, approach; otherwise the cat
<>might prove dangerous to him; if the cat,
<>when freed, saw the Can2d2a1la drawing near
<>he would immediately mount the tree and
<>not waste his time in jumping on the mouse;
<>Palita then could safely enter his hole 12. 136.
<>83-93; when the cat persisted in asking
<>Palita to make haste, Palita replied as
<>follows: “I have made treaty with one who
<>is stronger than me, I have therefore to protect [Page038-b+ 41]
<>myself; no one has any regard for the doer of
<>a good act, once the act has been fully done;
<>hence all good acts must be done with a part
<>left unfinished ({%na hi kas4 cit kr2te ka1rye
<>karta1ram3 samaveks2ate/tasma1t sarva1n2i
<>ka1rya1n2i sa1vas4es2a1n2i ka1rayet%} 12. 136. 105);
<>now only one cord remains; I shall cut down
<>that too at proper time” 12. 136. 100-107;
<>at dawn when the Can2d2a1la Parigha appeared,
<>true to his word, Palita cut off the last cord;
<>the freed cat, as expected by Palita, jumped up
<>the tree and Palita entered the hole 12. 136.
<>109-116; when the Can2d2a1la left the scene, the
<>cat asked Palita to come out of the hole and
<>move freely among the cats without appre-
<>hending any danger; he asked Palita to become
<>his minister and even guide him like his father
<>({%ama1tyo me bhava pra1jn5a piteva hi pras4a1dhi
<>ma1m%}) 12. 136. 119-126; but Palita refused to
<>oblige; he told the cat that there were no natu-
<>ral friends and no natural foes; hence there
<>were no permanent friendships and no perma-
<>nent enmities; friendships and enmities arise
<>due to certain common or conflicting interests
<>({%na1sti ja1tya1 ri1pur na1ma mitram3 na1ma na

<>132, 134); danger arising out of misplaced
<>trust cuts at the very roots; the affection bet-
<>ween them arose for some purpose; once that
<>purpose was served, friendship lost its ground;
<>mouse was food, and cat the eater; mouse was
<>weak cat strong; there could be no real
<>conciliation ({%sandhi%}) among parties of uneven
<>strength; Palita said he knew that it was the
<>cat's food time; that was the reason why the
<>cat was asking Palita to stir out; Palita finally
<>told the cat that if he remembered Palita's
<>good act let him wish well of the mouse ({%s4ivam2 [Page039-a+ 39]
<>dhya1yasva me 'trasthah2 sukr2tam3 smaryate

<>more attempt to win the confidence of Palita
<>and praised him 12. 136. 177-182; Palita did
<>not relent; he recited two {%ga1tha1s%} of Us4anas
<>(apparently 12. 136. 185-186) for the benefit
<>of the cat the purport of which was that if one
<>made conciliation ({%sandhi%}) with a person
<>stronger than himself to face a common enemy
<>he should not repose trust in his partner after
<>the purpose was served and that in all condi-
<>tions one should protect one's life since wealth
<>and children could be aquired if one remained
<>alive; Palita concluded that the sum and
<>substance of the {%ni1tis4a1stras%} was that distrust
<>was the best policy ({%san3ks2epo ni1tis4a1stra1n2a1m
<>avis4va1sah2 paro matah2%} 12. 136. 187); Palita
<>finally told the cat that the mouse must protect
<>himself from the cat as the cat must protect
<>himself from the Can2d2a1la; the cat, apparently
<>scared at hearing the word ‘Can2d2a1la’, ran
<>to his hole and Palita entered another hole;
<>thus the intelligent Palita, all by himself,
<>outwitted his many stronger enemies 12. 136.

<>mended abandoning the place where misdeed
<>was committed; enmities, once arisen, never
<>subsided, hence no trust should be reposed
<>in the enemy; the purpose for which she
<>lived in the palace was no longer there;
<>spirited men should abandon the place
<>where after receiving honour they are dis-
<>honoured; she said to the king: “I have

<>be happy” 12. 137. 21-30; the king pleaded

<>nothing wrong happened; once that happened,
<>she could trust the king no more; the king
<>then put the entire responsibility of what had

<>driven to act by Time nobody did anything
<>wrong to any one; he had forgiven Pu1jani1 [Page041-b+ 41]
<>for her act, so should she forgive him for
<>what (the prince) had done; Pu1jani1 retorted
<>saying that if Ka1la was to be blamed for
<>everything, why did men seek to take revenge ?
<>Why did Gods and Asuras fight with each
<>other ? Why did men give and take medicines
<>during illness ? She injured the king's son

<>be revived every time she remembered her
<>son; she then recited two {%ga1tha1s%} which
<>Us4anas had recited for Prahra1da (12. 137.

<>one who trusted the words of enemies was

<>Gautama thought of returning home but
<>since he had nothing to eat on way the
<>ungrateful Gautama decided to kill Ra1ja-

<>31; Ra1jadharman had kept fire burning with

<>Gautama, devoid of virtues as he was,
<>might have killed Ra1jadharman; he therefore
<>asked his son to visit Ra1jadharman's residence
<>and find out whether he was alive; Viru1-
<>pa1ks2a's son saw near the {%nyagrodha%} tree only
<>a skeleton of Ra1jadharman; he and his as-
<>sociates pursued Gautama, captured him, and
<>returned to Viru1pa1ks2a with the body of Ra1ja-

<>feet ({%ºs4ari1ram3 ca paks2a1sthicaran2ojjhitam%}
<>12. 166. 13) 12. 166. 5-14; Viru1pa1ks2a lame-
<>nted over the loss of his friend and prepared a

<>Viru1pa1ks2a performed the prescribed funeral
<>rites; at that time divine Surabhi, daughter
<>of Daks2a, happened to stand above the pyre
<>(in the sky); the foam from her mouth,
<>mixed with milk, fell down on the burning
<>pyre; Ra1jadharman came back to life and
<>met Viru1pa1ks2a; at that time Indra arrived [Page049-b+ 40]
<>on the scene and was glad that Ra1jadharman
<>was alive ({%dis2t2ya1yam3 ji1vati1ty uta%} 12. 167.
<>6); Indra told them an old incident ({%pura1-

<>was killed by Gautama, but was again
<>revived by Brahman by sprinkling nectar 12.
<>167. 1-10; since Indra was favourably dis-
<>posed to Ra1jadharman he was requested by
<>Ra1jadharman to bring Gautama back to life;
<>Indra revived Gautama and gave him to
<>Ra1jadharman; delighted Ra1jadharman em-
<>braced Gautama who had with him all kinds
<>of vessels full of gold ({%sabha1n2d2opaskaram%}

<>caught in a trap ({%unma1tha%} 12. 136. 23) fixed
<>by a Ca1n2d2a1la; when this happened Palita
<>began to move about freely, got a piece of

<>trap while smiling inwardly at the cat caught
<>in the trap below; just then the mouse
<>Palita saw his two other enemies, an
<>ichneumon on the ground and an owl on the
<>tree, wanting to get him; Palita immediately
<>realized that the cat, his third enemy in
<>distress, was his only means of escape; he
<>therefore offered the cat to cut off the cords [Page050-b+ 41]
<>of the net if the cat in return promised not
<>to injure him when he moved near the cat
<>to protect himself from the ichneumon and
<>the owl; Palita wished that Lomas4a remained
<>alive and expected a similar response from
<>Lomas4a ({%tava ji1vitam iccha1mi tvam3 mame-

<>knew that be by himself was almost at
<>the end of his life ({%ta1m avastha1m avek-

<>conciliatory terms to the mouse; Lomas4a
<>told the mouse that he had given up his
<>pride and that he was Palita's devotee and
<>pupil; he was prepared to carry out Palita's
<>order and work in his interest; he requested
<>Palita to do what would serve the purpose
<>of both of them; Palita then suggested the
<>following plan to Lomas4a: the mouse was
<>to go very close to the cat and while he
<>was in that condition the cat was to protect
<>the mouse from the owl and the ichneumon;
<>when the danger to the mouse from the two
<>had passed, the mouse was to cut the cords of
<>the net and free the cat; Lomas4a agreed to
<>this plan and promised not only to be well-
<>disposed towards Palita when he drew near, but
<>also offered later to do, with his friends and
<>relatives, things pleasing to Palita; the mouse
<>then moved very close to the cat and slept on
<>his chest; having seen that the ichneumon and
<>the owl had returned to their respective homes
<>Palita started to cut off the cords of the net
<>slowly; Lomas4a tried to hasten him asking
<>him not to be ungrateful; Lomas4a wanted
<>Palita to finish the work before the Can2d2a1la
<>({%s4vapaca%}) returned; Palita refused to hasten
<>until he was sure that the Can2d2a1la was close
<>by so that Lomas4a, when freed, would not
<>pounce on the mouse but jump on the tree
<>from the fear of the Can2d2a1la; Lomas4a again
<>pleaded with Palita to be more quick in his [Page051-a+ 41]
<>work pointing out that good men did not
<>act the way Palita was going about his
<>work; Palita should not remember their
<>past enmity and delay in freeing the cat;

<>most of the cords and deliberately left only
<>one which he would bite off at the proper
<>time; when the night ended and the Can2d2a1la
<>was seen arriving, Lomas4a was frightened and
<>asked Palita what he intended to do; Palita
<>cut off the last cord and the freed Lomas4a
<>jumped up the tree as was expected by Palita,
<>and Palita himself entered his hole; when the
<>disappointed Can2d2a1la went away, Lomas4a

<>of Janamejaya: When Va1suki heard the curse
<>of Kadru1, the mother of serpents, that they
<>would be burnt in the snake sacrifice of

<>with his brother Aira1vata and other serpents
<>to think of the remedy to nullify the curse
<>({%s4a1po 'yam3 na bhavet katham%} 1. 33. 1); he
<>told them that all curses had a cure, but the
<>curse of a mother would be difficult to avert,
<>especially when the curse was uttered within
<>the hearing of the imperishable god (i. e.
<>Brahman) (cf. 1. 18. 9) and the god did not
<>stop her from uttering the terrible curse; yet
<>they had to find a way out before it was too
<>late; they had to see if the snake sacrifice of
<>Janamejaya did not get started or, if started,
<>it could be defeated in its purpose ({%yatha1 sa
<>yajn5o na bhaved yatha1 va1pi para1bhavet%} 1.
<>33. 9) 1. 33. 1-9; he listened to the sugges-
<>tions made by serpents to avoid the snake
<>sacrifice but did not agree with any one of
<>them; he himself had nothing better to offer,
<>hence he was worried 1. 33. 29-31; at that time
<>Ela1patra informed Va1suki that since Pita1maha
<>Brahman had prophesied that the son of the [Page055-b+ 41]
<>great sage Jaratka1ru born of his wife having
<>the same name would stop the snake sacrifice
<>and free virtuous serpents from danger,
<>Va1suki should give in marriage his sister,
<>who was named Jaratka1ru, to the sage, when
<>he came begging for a maiden; that would
<>put an end to the fear of the serpents 1. 34.
<>1-18; earlier, after the churning of the ocean,
<>the gods had taken Va1suki to Pita1maha
<>Brahman and told him that Va1suki was very
<>much disturbed due to the curse of his mother
<>and that Pita1maha should free him from his
<>mental agony; they pointed out that Va1suki
<>had always acted for the benefit of the gods
<>and for what was dear to them; Pita1maha
<>had then told the gods that when the occasion
<>arrived Va1suki should act according to the
<>advice of Ela1patra 1. 35. 5-7; 1. 48. 25;
<>1. 49. 9-13, 25; thereafter Va1suki took great
<>care of his sister Jaratka1ru knowing her to be
<>the saviour of serpents 1. 35. 2; Va1suki appoi-
<>nted various serpents to watch for Jaratka1ru
<>and report to him when Jaratka1ru arrived
<>asking for a wife 1. 35. 12-13; when Jarat-
<>ka1ru arrived Va1suki's attendants informed him
<>about Jaratka1ru's intention to marry a girl
<>of his name and who was offered as alms;
<>knowing this Va1suki approached the sage
<>Jaratka1ru with his well-adorned sister; the
<>sage asked Va1suki his sister's name and also
<>told him that even after marriage it would be
<>Va1suki's responsibility to maintain her 1. 42.
<>16-20; Va1suki assured Jaratka1ru that his
<>sister had the same name as the sage and
<>that he would support her even after marriage
<>with all his might 1. 42. 16-20; 1. 43. 1-2;
<>1. 13. 30-34; Jaratka1ru then went to Va1suki's
<>residence and married his sister; Jaratka1ru
<>went with his wife to the shining house
<>({%va1sagr2ham3 s4ubhram%} 1. 43. 5) approved by
<>Va1suki 1. 43. 3-5; when the sage Jaratka1ru [Page056-a+ 41]
<>left his wife he asked her to inform Va1suki
<>about his departure and that he had lived
<>happily with him 1. 43. 29; Jaratka1ru's wife
<>pleaded with the sage that he should not
<>abandon her; he should realize what Va1suki
<>would feel if he knew that her husband had
<>left her without blessing her with a son--
<>that being the principal purpose of their
<>marriage--1. 43. 32-34; when Va1suki knew
<>about Jaratka1ru's departure he was sorry;
<>but he would not pursue the sage fearing that
<>he might curse him; he knew it was improper
<>to ask his sister if she was with a child from
<>Jaratka1ru but the seriousness of the matter
<>prompted him to do that ({%kim3 hi ka1rya-
<>gari1yastva1t tatas tva1ham acu1cudam%} 1. 44.
<>6); Va1suki's sister assured him that she had
<>conceived from Jaratka1ru and that a lustrous
<>son will be born to her; she removed his
<>anxiety; on hearing the news Va1suki was
<>happy; he honoured his sister by giving gifts 1.
<>44. 1-15; later when the snake sacrifice began
<>Va1suki was highly disturbed due to the death
<>of a large number of serpents and feared that
<>he himself might fall into the fire; he there-
<>fore told his sister Jaratka1ru that the time
<>had came for her son A1sti1ka to intervene and
<>stop the destruction of the snakes 1. 48. 19-

<>fil the purpose for which she was married to
<>Jaratka1ru; on enquiry, Jaratka1ru told A1sti1ka
<>why Va1suki gave her to the sage Jaratka1ru 1.
<>49. 1-15; A1sti1ka assured Va1suki, who was
<>terribly upset, that he would release him from
<>the curse and remove his fear 1. 49. 17-21;
<>when Va1suki again expressed his anxiety by
<>saying that he felt he was revolving, that

<>{@A.@} Family: One of the two daughters
<>of Praja1pati, sister of Kadru1 (1. 19. 1),
<>both married to Kas4yapa 1. 14. 5-6; one
<>of the thirteen daughters of Daks2a 1. 59.

<>{@C.@} Progeny: (1) Kas4yapa, her husband,
<>granted her a boon (also 1. 31. 2); she chose
<>to have two sons, stronger than the sons of
<>Kadru1; but the husband granted her one and a
<>half sons as desired ({%? adhyardham3 putram
<>i1psitam%} 1. 14. 9) [thus in view of the fact that
<>one of her two sons was not fully developed ?
<>1. 14. 16; 1. 27. 34]; when the husband said
<>“so be it”, Vinata1 was delighted to know
<>that she will have two strong sons 1. 14. 6-
<>10; after a long time Vinata1 laid two eggs
<>which were preserved for five hundred years

<>when after five hundred years Kadru1's sons
<>came out of the eggs but nothing came out of
<>the two eggs laid by Vinata1, she, ashamed and
<>desirous of quickly having a son, broke one
<>of the two eggs and saw her partly developed
<>son; angered, the son cursed his mother (also
<>1. 31. 1) for her impatience, to become the
<>slave ({%da1si1%} 1. 14. 17) of Kadru1 with whom she
<>vied; he also told the mother that her second
<>son will free her from slavery if she did not
<>break the other egg prematurely and produce
<>a son deficient in limbs; the undeveloped son
<>became Arun2a; her second son, Garud2a, was
<>born at proper time; as soon as born he left
<>Vinata1 and flew into the sky 1. 14. 12-22; 1.
<>26. 36; (2) Vinata1, desirous of having a son,
<>practised penance and observed vows; having
<>bathed and become pure she approached her

<>succeed and that she would give birth to heroic

<>of Kadru1: Once the two sisters Kadru1 and
<>Vinata1 happened to see the horse Uccaih2-
<>s4ravas from very near 1. 15. 1; Kadru1
<>later asked Vinata1 the colour of the horse;
<>Vinata1 declared it to be white and asked
<>Kadru1's opinion; Vinata1 was ready to put a
<>wager on it; Kadru1 declared that the horse
<>had dark hair on its tail; the two agreed to
<>lay a wager with slavery as stake; they then
<>went home agreeing to inspect the horse the
<>next day 1. 18. 2-5; next morning the two
<>sisters went to inspect Uccaih2s4ravas from
<>near; they crossed the ocean on the way 1.
<>19. 1-3; when they found that there were
<>many black hair on the tail of Uccaih2s4ravas,
<>Kadru1 made Vinata1 her slave; Vinata1 who
<>lost the bet and was defeated was grieved
<>to be reduced to the condition of a slave 1.
<>20. 1-3; 1. 49. 6; once when Garud2a visited
<>the slave Vinata1 on the other shore of the
<>ocean, Kadru1 asked Vinata1 in the presence
<>of Garud2a to take her to the beautiful
<>Ra1man2i1yaka, the abode of the {%na1gas%} in the
<>middle of the ocean; Vinata1 did as command- [Page058-a+ 40]
<>ed and Garud2a, as directed by his mother,
<>carried the serpents 1. 21. 1-5; Garud2a asked
<>Vinata1 why he must act as told by the ser-
<>pents; Vinata1 informed him that she having
<>lost the wager had become the slave of her
<>sister; the serpents, on being asked by Garud2a
<>how he (and his mother) could be free from
<>slavery, told him to get {%amr2ta%} for them
<>to win freedom from slavery 1. 23. 8-12;
<>Garud2a got ready to fetch {%amr2ta%} and
<>asked Vinata1 what he might eat on way;
<>Vinata1 asked him to eat the Nis2a1das whose
<>abode lay far away in the middle of the ocean
<>({%samudrakuks2a1v eka1nte%} 1. 24. 2), and warned
<>him never to injure a Bra1hman2a 1. 24. 1-3;
<>on being further asked by Garud2a how he
<>could recognize a Bra1hman2a, Vinata1 told him:
<>“who, when swallowed, burns your throat like
<>a heated charcoal, know him to be a Bra1h-
<>man2a”; then Vinata1, although she knew the
<>incomparable prowess of her son, blessed him
<>as follows: “May Wind protect your wings,
<>Moon your back, Fire your head, and Sun
<>the whole of you; myself shall always endeav-
<>our for your comfort and well-being ({%s4a1nti-
<>svastipara1yan2a1%} 1. 24. 9); may your path
<>be free from obstacles and may you succeed
<>in your task” 1. 24. 5-9; on way Garud2a
<>met his father and told him that he was on his
<>way to fetch {%soma%} in order to free his mother
<>from slavery; he also told him that he was
<>asked by Vinata1 to eat the Nis2a1das but was
<>not satisfied even after eating thousands of
<>them; he asked Kas4yapa what else he might
<>eat 1. 25. 7-9; when Garud2a succeeded in

<>was leaving the {%amr2ta%} for them on {%kus4a%} grass
<>his mother should be freed from slavery from

<>Surabhi grieved because of the torture of the
<>weak bull; when Indra asked her that while
<>she had thousands of sons who were tortured

<>Surabhi replied that all her sons were equal
<>to her but she had more compassion for the

<>the purpose of his arriving at a place which

<>Hanu1mant, Bhi1ma replied that Hanu1mant
<>was his brother, meritorious, brave and in- [Page081-b+ 40]
<>telligent, famous in the Ra1ma1yan2a; he crossed
<>the ocean to find out Ra1ma's wife; knowing
<>Bhi1ma to be arrogant due to the strength of
<>his arms, Hanu1mant again told him that as he
<>could not move due to old age Bhi1ma should
<>set aside his tail from the path and proceed;
<>Bhi1ma failed in his attempt to lift the tail
<>and stood with his face turned down due to
<>shame; he bowed down to Hanu1mant asking
<>for forgiveness; Bhi1ma requested Hanu1mant
<>to reveal his identity and let him know whether
<>he was a {%siddha,%} a god, a Gandharva, or a
<>Guhyaka in the form of a monkey 3. 147.
<>17-22; Hanu1mant then told Bhi1ma who he
<>really was and that he used to live with
<>Sugri1va on the R2s4yamu1ka mountain since
<>the latter was cheated by his brother Va1lin

<>that he had gone out with other crores of
<>monkeys in search of Si1ta1 and was informed
<>by a vulture (Jat2a1yus) about Si1ta1; he had
<>then jumped over the ocean, one hundred
<>{%yojanas%} wide, seen Si1ta1 in Ra1van2a's house,
<>and returned after announcing himself to
<>Ra1van2a; when Ra1ma finally started (for

<>to him; Gandharvas and Apsarases sing the

<>again told Bhi1ma that no mortal could go
<>beyond the point where they met since it was

<>Bhi1ma that he had blocked Bhi1ma's way les the
<>should be attacked or cursed by some one, and

<>by 3. 147. 33-41; Bhi1ma then told Hanu1mant
<>that he was highly blessed by his meeting with
<>Hanu1mant; Bhi1ma requested him to show the [Page082-a+ 40]
<>unrivalled form which he had assumed when he
<>leapt over the ocean; only then Bhi1ma would
<>believe what Hanu1mant had told about him-
<>self; Hanu1mant informed Bhi1ma that it was
<>not possible to assume forms of the bygone age;
<>one acquired the strength, form and prowess
<>according to the {%yuga%} in which one lived; he
<>had to follow the (rule of the) {%yuga,%} since no

<>149. 14-20; Hanu1mant then permitted Bhi1ma
<>to depart and showed him the way leading
<>to the Saugandhikavana and the garden of
<>Kubera; he warned Bhima not to pluck the
<>flowers himself and asked him to show regard
<>for the deities; he asked Bhi1ma not to act
<>rashly but follow the {%dharma%} 3. 149. 21-24;
<>Hanu1mant then gave a long discourse on

<>{%varn2as;%} the conduct of a king) 3. 149. 26-52;
<>Hanu1mant contracted his body and embraced
<>Bhi1ma; the embrace removed Bhi1ma's fatigue;
<>with faltering voice and tears in his eyes
<>Hanu1mant asked Bhi1ma to remember him and [Page082-b+ 40]
<>not to tell anyone of his whereabouts; having
<>embraced a mortal (Bhi1ma) Hanu1mant was
<>happy to be reminded of Ra1ma; Hanu1mant
<>offered a boon to Bhi1ma: if Bhi1ma so wished
<>Hanu1mant could go Ha1stinapura and kill the

<>a rock 3. 150. 1-9; but Bhi1ma told Hanu1-

<>could do for Bhi1ma; instead of a boon he only
<>asked for Hanu1mant's forgiveness and favour;

<P>Sage Kr2s2n2advaipa1yana (Vya1sa) once,
<>while wandering, saw a worm ({%ki1t2a%} 13. 118. 7)
<>running speedily away on a cart-road; the sage
<>asked the worm why he appeared so terrified,
<>what was the source of his fear, and where
<>he was going in haste; the worm replied that
<>he had heard the sound of a big cart, as
<>also the breathing of the bulls who were
<>drawing heavy burden, and sound of men; such
<>sounds could not be borne by worms; he was
<>running away from danger to his life; death
<>is painful and life is not easily obtained; when
<>the sage told the worm that he should be
<>happy to die since he was leading life in a
<>lower species ({%tiryagyoni%} 13. 118. 14) where
<>one did not understood sound, touch, taste,
<>smell and did not get diverse enjoyments, the [Page086-b+ 40]
<>worm replied that a living being was attached
<>to whatever life he was in and hence he was
<>happy even in his present condition; as a
<>worm, he got the enjoyments his body needed;
<>men and animals have different enjoyments;
<>the worm told Vya1sa that in his former life
<>as a human being he was a wealthy S4u1dra,
<>but he was not devoted to Bra1hman2as; he
<>was cruel, living on usury, harsh in speech,
<>cunning in behaviour, plunderer of all; he
<>committed all sorts of cruel acts (13. 118.
<>19-24), remembering which he now repented;
<>but he had respected his mother and honoured
<>a good Bra1hman2a with guest-worship; it was
<>on that account that he did not lose his
<>memory (of past birth); the worm felt that
<>due to that virtuous act he could hope for
<>happiness and asked Vya1sa what he was going
<>to be 13. 118. 7-28; Vya1sa told the worm
<>that it was due to his (Vya1sa's) favour
<>that the worm was not stupefied; sage Vya1sa
<>was able to save beings by merely looking
<>at them ({%aham3 hi dars4ana1d eva ta1raya1mi
<>tapobala1t%} 13. 119. 2); Vya1sa knew that the
<>worm was reduced to that condition due to
<>his evil acts; but the worm would attain great
<>religious merit if he considered himself as
<>practising {%dharma%} ({%ava1psyasi param3 dhar-
<>mam3 dharmastho yadi manyase%} 13. 119. 3);
<>the worm would attain that state which an
<>excellent Bra1hman2a ({%vipra%}) attained by
<>worshipping Sun and Moon and by telling
<>holy narratives; Vya1sa would lead the worm
<>to that state of {%brahma%} which was desired by
<>him; having got this assurance from Vya1sa
<>the worm (stopped running away and) stood
<>where he was; he went to see the sage when,
<>after death, having passed through various
<>births (13. 119. 9) he was born a Ks2atriya;
<>as a prince he fell at the feet of the sage [Page087-a+ 40]
<>and described to him the comforts he enjoyed
<>in his present condition (13. 119. 12-15); he
<>acknowledged that it was due to the favour
<>of the sage that he, having once been a
<>worm, was now a prince; he asked Vya1sa
<>what next he should do; the sage told him
<>that his earlier sin was not destroyed; what-
<>ever good he had formerly done got him to
<>see the sage; that merit led him to the birth
<>of a Ks2atriya; now by offering his life on
<>the battle-field for the sake of cows and
<>Bra1hman2as and by performing sacrifices
<>({%?r2tu1n%} 13. 119. 22) he could, having become
<>{%brahman (brahmabhu1 ah2 ?),%} obtain enjoy-
<>ments in heaven (13. 119. 1-23); the Ks2atriya
<>then began to practise severe austerities;
<>Vya1sa approached him and told him that as
<>a Ks2atriya his duty was to protect beings;
<>if he followed his {%dharma,%} he would become
<>a Bra1hman2a; the Ks2atriya did as told and
<>after death became a Bra1hman2a; Kr2s2n2a-
<>dvaipa1yana came to him again and told him
<>not to be afflicted by anything; he would be
<>in danger if he neglected {%dharma;%} hence he
<>should practise the highest {%dharma%} ({%dharma-
<>lopa1d bhayam3 te sya1t tasma1d dharmam3
<>carottamam%} 13. 120. 10); the worm again
<>acknowledged his debt to Vya1sa; he felt that
<>his sin was destroyed since he had obtained
<>prosperity rooted in {%dharma;%} the worm, who
<>was then a Bra1hman2a, marked the earth by
<>the {%yu1pas%} of sacrifices performed by him;

<>in consultation with Dhr2s2t2adyumna, made
<>use of this {%vyu1ha%} to counter the Garud2a-

<>the right horn ({%daks2in2a s4r2n3ga%}) of {%the vyu1ha;%}
<>behind him stood Vira1t2a and Drupada, follo-

<>Dhr2s2t2aketu, surrounded by the Cedis, the
<>Ka1s4is, the Karu1s2as and the Pauravas; in the
<>middle of the {%vyu1ha%} stood Dhr2s2t2adyumna,
<>S4ikhan2d2in, the Pa1n5ca1las, and the Prabhadrakas,
<>ready to fight; Dharmara1ja, surrounded by
<>the army of the elephants also stood there;
<>so also Sa1tyaki and the five sons of Drau-
<>padi1; they were immediately followed by
<>Abhimanyu and Ira1vant; then came Ghat2o-

<>warriors Kekayas; on the left side of the {%vyu1ha%}
<>stood Arjuna protected by Jana1rdana 6. 52.
<>10-18. (2) On the fifteenth day of the

<>of the Kaurava army arranged by Karn2a;
<>Bhi1ma was stationed on the left, Dhr2s2t2a- [Page091-a+ 39]
<>dyumna on the right side; in the middle stood
<>Arjuna; Nakula, Sahadeva and Dharmara1ja
<>were posted at the back; Yudha1manyu and
<>Uttamaujas, the two Pa1n5ca1la heroes, acted
<>as the wheel-protectors of Arjuna; the rest
<>of the kings took positions in keeping with
<>their dispositions, energy and mettle ({%yatha1-

<P>{@A1gneya1stra^1@} nt.: Name of a missile;
<>referred to as A1gni-astra in {%ubhe caiva1gni-
<>ma1rute%} 5. 140. 6.
<>{@A.@} Origin and succession: Arjuna
<>told Gandharva An3ga1raparn2a that Br2haspati
<>gave it first to Bharadva1ja, Bharadva1ja to
<>sage Agnives4ya, Agnives4ya to Dron2a, and
<>Dron2a to Arjuna 1. 158. 26-27; 1. 121. 6-7;
<>but Arjuna told Uttara that he obtained
<>A1gneya1stra from god Agni 4. 56. 14; when
<>Gandharva An3ga1raparn2a expressed his desire
<>to learn the {%astra,%} Arjuna taught it to him in
<>exchange of the Gandharva horses ({%gandhar-
<>vaja1h2…haya1h2%} 1. 158. 51) 1. 158. 54-55;
<>Arjuna taught it to the Gandharva with due
<>rites ({%yatha1vidhi%}) 1. 174. 3; when Arjuna
<>requested Indra for heavenly weapons, Indra
<>assured him that he would give him all the
<>heavenly missiles, {%a1gneya%} and the rest
<>({%a1gneya1ni ca sarva1n2i%}) after Arjuna had
<>satisfied god Maha1deva 1. 225. 12, 10; among
<>the epic heroes, besides Dron2a and Arjuna, [Page091-b+ 40]
<>its use was known also to Kr2s2n2a (6. 116. 38;
<>also see {@A1gneya1stra^2@}), Bhi1s2ma, Karn2a and
<>As4vattha1man (7. 166. 2) [See the section {@C@}

<>6. 116. 38; 7. 73. 46; very dreadful ({%maha1-
<>ghora%}) 7. 73. 46; very frightful ({%suda1run2a%})
<>4. 59. 21; irresistible even by the gods ({%devair
<>api sudurdhars2am%}) 7. 172. 14. {@C.@} Its
<>use in war and its effects: 1. In the epic
<>war: (i) when used by Karn2a against
<>Arjuna, it gave to Karn2a's bow a fiery
<>look and it released fiery arrows; Arjuna
<>apparently combated it with the same kind of
<>{%astra (astram3 astren2a sam3va1rya%}) 7. 31. 51-
<>52; (ii) used by Dron2a against Yuyudha1na
<>(Sa1tyaki); this was combated by Sa1tyaki
<>with Va1run2a1stra 7. 73. 46; (iii) Bha1radva1ja
<>(Dron2a) used A1gneya and other heavenly
<>missiles against Yudhis2t2hira which were ren-
<>dered ineffective by Yudhis2t2hira 7. 132. 29-30;
<>(iv) As4vattha1man used it against Arjuna;
<>when released, it produced a shower of
<>arrows ({%s4aravars2am aja1yata%} 7. 172. 16;
<>{%s4aravr2s2t2ayah2%} 7. 172. 22); cold winds blew, sun
<>lost its lustre, clouds rained blood, all beings
<>became restless; the arrows were fiery and
<>produced good deal of heat; they burnt down
<>enemies, elephants, horses and chariots; the
<>god Fire burnt the army like the Sam3vartaka
<>fire at the end of the aeon 7. 172. 16-27; the
<>whole army, including Arjuna, could not be
<>seen due to the darkness; the like of the {%astra%}
<>released by As4vattha1man was never seen
<>before by Sam3jaya and his colleagues 7. 172.
<>30-31; Arjuna combated it with Bra1hma Astra
<>7. 172. 14, 32; it was meant to be used by
<>Arjuna in the war 5. 140. 6 (here referred to
<>as A1gni instead of A1gneya). 2. Outside
<>the epic war: (i) Arjuna used it against
<>Gandharva An3ga1raparn2a; when released, it [Page092-a+ 39]
<>burnt down the excellent chariot of An3ga1ra-
<>parn2a, and he fell down, head downwards, as
<>he swooned due to the lustre of the missile 1.
<>158. 28, 29, 37; (ii) used by Dron2a (besides
<>using other divine missiles) against Arjuna at
<>the time of the cattle-raid; Arjuna combated
<>it with his A1gneya1stra 4. 53. 48; (iii) on the
<>same occasion used by Bhi1s2ma and Arjuna
<>against each other to combat each other's
<>missiles 4. 59. 21; (iv) in his fight with
<>Citrasena and the Gandharvas Arjuna killed
<>thousands of Gandharvas with A1gneya1stra
<>3. 234. 7; when released once again, the
<>Gandharvas, afflicted by heat, were dejected
<>3. 234. 17; (v) at the time of displaying
<>his skill in the use of missiles, Arjuna
<>produced fire by releasing A1gneya1stra 1. 125.
<>19; (vi) employed by Bhi1s2ma against
<>Ra1ma (Ja1madagnya); it was rendered in-
<>effective by the counter-use of Va1run2a1stra
<>5. 181. 12. {@D.@} Mode of use: The normal
<>arrows were supposed to be infused by this

<>heavenly ({%divya%}) 4. 58. 8, an excellent
<>missile ({%astravara%} 6. 55. 120; {%uttama1stra%} 6.
<>55. 111); bright like the sun ({%a1dityasam3-

<>Mode of use: Certain {%mantras%} were recited
<>over the bow, the bow-string, and the arrow

<>he put to use the Ma1hendra astra by
<>forcefully drawing the Ga1n2d2i1va bow 6.

<>were not enough to ward off their arrows, [Page095-a+ 40]
<>Arjuna brought forth his Aindra astra and
<>successfully repelled the arrows of the
<>enemies 6. 77. 40-41; (iii) when Arjuna
<>was attacked by S4ruta1yus and Acyuta1yus
<>who showered arrows on the right and left of
<>Arjuna and attacked him with {%tomara%} and
<>{%s4u1la%} respectively, Arjuna manifested S4a1kra
<>astra to take care of the weapons of the
<>enemies and kill both of them 7. 68. 7-13,
<>21; (iii) when attacked by the Sam3s4aptakas
<>all together, Arjuna manifested Aindra astra
<>to cut down all sorts of weapons of the
<>enemies as also to cut off their limbs and
<>chariots 8. 19. 22-29; (iv) when Arjuna
<>was severely struck on his chest by Sus4ar-
<>man, he produced Aindra astra 8. 37. 30-31;
<>(v) used by Arjuna to combat Karn2a's
<>Brahma1stra 8. 66. 48-50; (vi) used by
<>Arjuna to combat the Aindra astra used by
<>Dron2a 7. 163. 28; (vii) used, together with
<>Va1yavya, by Dron2a against Yudhis2t2hira; the

<>with an invisible Vajra ({%adr2s4yena vajren2a%})
<>14. 11. 6-19; (ii) Vis4varu1pa-Tris4iras
<>episode: (a) when the gods led by Indra
<>approached god Brahman complaining that
<>Vis4varupa (Tris4iras), son of Tvas2t2r2, drank
<>away all Soma offered in sacrifices, and that
<>they were left without a share, Brahman
<>advised them to approach the sage Dadhi1ca
<>and request him to give up his body; the gods
<>should then fashion a Vajra from the bones
<>of Dadhi1ca 12. 329. 24-25; when Dadhi1ca
<>gave up his body, Dha1tr2 fashioned a Vajra
<>out of the bones; with that Vajra, produced
<>from the bones of a Bra1hman2a and in which
<>god Vis2n2u had entered, Indra killed Vis4varu1pa
<>and cut off his heads 12. 329. 27; (b)
<>when Indra failed to tempt Tris4iras, son of
<>Tvas2t2r2, with Apsarases while he was practis-
<>ing penance, he decided to strike Vajra at
<>him; when struck by Vajra, Tris4iras fell down
<>like the summit of a mountain; Indra was
<>still afraid of Tris4iras and he asked a wood-
<>cutter ({%taks2an%}) to cut off the heads of the
<>lying Tris4iras assuring Taks2an that he would
<>make his axe Vajra-like ({%matprasa1da1d dhi
<>te s4astram3 vajrakalpam3 bhavis2yati%} 5. 9. 27);
<>the woodcutter finally cut off the heads of [Page134-b+ 40]
<>Tris4iras with his axe 5. 9. 15-34; (iii) Meet-
<>ing of Bali and Indra: when Indra met Bali
<>in the form of a donkey ({%khara%} 12. 216. 12),
<>Bali told Indra that he could fell down Indra
<>with his fist although Indra was equipped with
<>Vajra, but that that was the time to show for-
<>bearance ({%ks2ama1%}) and not valour ({%vikrama%})
<>12. 217. 38-39; 12. 220. 79-80; Indra told
<>Bali that since he was asked by god Brahman
<>not to kill Bali, he was not releasing his
<>Vajra at him (Bali) (12. 218. 33); Indra
<>asked Bali why he was not grieved although
<>he was formerly struck by Vajra 12. 220.
<>18; Bali told Indra that he was not afraid of
<>him (Indra) although he saw him with his
<>Vajra raised ({%vajram udyamya tis2t2hantam%})
<>12. 220. 21; Indra was surprised at the tran-
<>quility of Bali for he was not afraid of Indra
<>with Vajra raised in his hand 12. 220. 89;
<>(iv) Garud2a episode: on his way to fetch
<>{%amr2ta,%} when Garud2a flew to the mountain
<>whose caves were blocked with snow, there
<>were bad omens for the gods; Indra's dear
<>missile Vajra blazed with pain ({%indrasya

<>26. 28; when Garud2a was taking away {%amr2ta,%}
<>Indra struck him with Vajra; Garud2a smiled
<>and told Indra that just out of respect for the
<>sage (Dadhi1ca) from whose bones the Vajra
<>was fashioned, out of respect for Vajra itself,
<>and Indra, he would let fall just one of his
<>feathers; otherwise, due to the blow of the
<>missile, he felt no pain at all; surprised, Indra
<>sought friendship with Garud2a 1. 29. 17-23;
<>(v) Fight between the gods and Skanda:
<>when during the fight between the gods and
<>Skanda, the gods abandoned Indra, he released
<>his Vajra at Skanda; it struck Skanda on his
<>right side and split it open; due to the impact
<>of Vajra was produced another young man [Page135-a+ 40]
<>({%purus2o 'parah2/yuva1%}) with golden armour,
<>wearing heavenly {%kun2d2alas,%} and holding

<>S4iva and Indra: (a) S4iva, in the form of a
<>child in the lap of Uma1, froze the arm of
<>S4akra which held Vajra (since apparently
<>Indra wanted to strike Vajra at the child
<>not realising that the child was S4iva); when
<>Brahma1 and the other gods propitiated S4iva
<>(Rudra) and Uma1, Indra's hand, holding the
<>Vajra, became as before 7. 173. 60-63; 13.
<>145. 30-34; (b) Indra once desirous to have
<>Mahes4vara's glory hurled his Vajra at him;
<>it burnt Mahes4vara's throat and departed;
<>that is why S4iva is called S4ri1kan2t2ha ({%tena

<>of Hiran2yakas4ipu, fought with Indra for a
<>million years; due to the boon he had obtained
<>from Maha1deva (S4iva) Indra's Vajra was
<>shattered on the limbs of the “tormentor”

<>Arjuna and its use by him: Arjuna learnt

<>after reciting the {%mantras%} on the Ga1n2d2i1va
<>bow ({%ga1n2d2i1vam anumantrya ca%}); the result [Page135-b+ 40]
<>was that the sharp, iron arrows released from
<>his bow had the impact of Vajra ({%amun5cam3
<>vajrasam3sparsa1n a1yasa1n nis4ita1n5 s4ara1n%});
<>the arrows, propelled by the Vajra and which
<>had themselves become Vajra-like ({%te vajra-

<>of the demons and the demons themselves;

<>sons of Draupadi1 and Abhimanyu protected
<>Bhi1ma from behind ({%pr2s2t2hagopa1h2%} 6. 19. 20);
<>Dhr2s2t2adyumna, helped by the Prabhadrakas,
<>offered protection to all of them (6. 19. 21);
<>the king (Vira1t2a ?), surrounded by an army,
<>{%aks2auhin2i1%} strong, together with his brothers
<>and sons guarded them from behind;
<>S4ikhan2d2in, guarded by Arjuna, followed them;
<>Yuyudha1na (Sa1tyaki) protected Arjuna
<>from behind ({%pr2s2t2hagopa%}) and Yudha1-
<>manyu and Uttamaujas acted as his wheel-
<>protectors ({%cakraraks2au%}); Yudhis2t2hira, with
<>elephants, took position in the middle; the
<>Pa1n5ca1la king Yajn5asena with an army,

<>Dhr2s2t2adyumna, having moved from

<>protected Yudhis2t2hira from behind; hundreds
<>and thousands of foot-soldiers moved in the

<>name of the Vyu1ha is not mentioned but
<>the description of which apparently applies to
<>the arrangement of the Pa1n2d2ava army on the

<>contingents ({%ani1ka1ni%}) of his army to counter
<>the Vyu1ha (Sarvatobhadra) of Bhi1s2ma;
<>S4ikhan2d2in's contingent stood in the middle,
<>protected by Arjuna (also 6. 22. 14); Dhr2s2t2a-
<>dyumna's contingent was protected by Bhi1ma
<>himself; the contingent on the right side of the
<>Vyu1ha ({%ani1kam3 daks2in2am%}) was protected by
<>Yuyudha1na (Sa1tyaki); Yudhis2t2hira's chariot
<>was stationed in the midst of elephants;
<>Bhi1ma, along with Nakula and Sahadeva, is
<>said to be the guard of the chariot of the hero
<>({%vi1rarathasya gopta1%} i. e. Arjuna ? Dhr2s2t2a-

<>35, 38; 8. 5. 65. {@C.@} What the S4akti meant
<>to Karn2a: Karn2a had great confidence due to
<>the S4akti ({%ayam3 ca pratyayah2 karn2e s4aktya1%})
<>7. 157. 31; when Va1sava (Indra) gave the
<>S4akti to Karn2a, he (Karn2a) felt that Arjuna
<>was as good as dead 7. 155. 21-22; with
<>S4akti in Karn2a's hand, no one in the world
<>dare oppose him 7. 155. 13; Karn2a had
<>preserved the S4akti to kill Arjuna 7. 122. 33;
<>7. 148. 34; 7. 154. 53; the S4akti meant
<>death for Arjuna 7. 157. 38; Duh2s4a1sana,
<>S4akuni, Jayadratha and Duryodhana always
<>counselled Karn2a not to use the S4akti against
<>any one except Arjuna 7. 157. 32-34; (cf.
<>7. 157. 19-21 for the use of S4akti (not named)
<>only against Arjuna or Kr2s2n2a); if on any
<>occasion Karn2a's other missiles had failed and
<>if he was pressed ({%pi1d2itah2%}) by the circums-
<>tances, he would certainly have used his
<>Va1savi1 S4akti against Arjuna 7. 158. 54;
<>hence Kr2s2n2a protected Arjuna particularly
<>from the unfailing S4akti which, if released, [Page146-a+ 40]
<>would certainly have killed him like the light-
<>ning striking down a tree 7. 157. 16;
<>according to Vya1sa too if Arjuna and
<>Karn2a had clashed, the latter, after exhaus-
<>ting all other missiles, would have surely
<>used Va1savi1 against Arjuna 7. 158. 56;
<>Kr2s2n2a was therefore always looking for a
<>way to render the unfailing S4akti futile
<>({%amogha1m3 ta1m3 katham3 s4aktim3 mogha1m3
<>kurya1m%}) 7. 157. 29; when the S4akti was
<>diverted on Ghat2otkaca, Karn2a, in the

<>of his S4akti, he became an ordinary

<>and Arjuna could dare attack him 8. 22. 33.
<>{@D.@} Why the S4akti was not used against
<>Arjuna: Both Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Sa1tyaki asked

<>was not used by Karn2a against Arjuna 7.
<>157. 1; 7. 158. 2-3; 7. 157. 31; (1) accor-
<>ding to Sam3jaya's reporting, Duryodhana,
<>S4akuni, Duh2s4a1sana, and he himself urged
<>Karn2a every night after the day's war to use
<>his S4akti the next day against Arjuna or
<>Kr2s2n2a (7. 157. 19-21), but that counsel was
<>forgotten the next day during the fight due
<>to the watchfulness of Kr2s2n2a ({%sa1 tu buddhih2
<>kr2ta1py evam3 ja1grati tridas4es4vare/aprameye
<>hr2s2i1kes4e yuddhaka1le vyamuhyata%}) 7. 157. 27;
<>Kr2s2n2a also never brought Arjuna face to face
<>with Karn2a as long as the latter was equipped
<>with S4akti; Kr2s2n2a managed to see that
<>other warriors faced Karn2a 7. 157. 28-29;
<>according to Sam3jaya, again, the previous
<>night's counsel (7. 158. 4-5) was forgotten
<>by Karn2a the next day due to the deities
<>(unfavorable) to him and to the other heroes
<>(on the side of the Kauravas), and thus [Page146-b+ 40]
<>it was primarily due to the working of the
<>fate that Karn2a did not employ his S4akti
<>against Arjuna or Kr2s2n2a to kill any one of
<>them ({%tatah2 prabha1tasamaye ra1jan karn2asya

<>({%dis2t2ya1%}) that Arjuna was not locked in
<>a duel with Karn2a prior to the latter's being
<>relieved of the S4akti 7. 158. 54; according

<>not use his S4akti against Arjuna ({%aham

<>7. 157. 37; (4) according to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>both fate and the intelligence of Kr2s2n2a
<>came together to defeat the purpose of the

<>Ghat2otkaca by using the S4akti given to him

<>Karn2a held the S4akti desiring to kill Ghat2ot-

<>and which he had preserved for Arjuna
<>for years; when the missile was released,
<>Ghat2otkaca, afraid, assumed a huge form

<P>Usually this is considered to be the desi-

<>Maha1bha1rata at the hands of Vais4a1m3pa1yana
<>and Su1ta Ugras4ravas respectively; as the name
<>of the Maha1bha1rata it probably occurs in the
<>opening {%man3gala s4loka%} found at the begin-
<>ning of the different {%parvans (na1ra1yan2am3
<>namaskr2tya naram3 caiva narottamam/
<>devi1m3 sarasvati1m3 caiva tato {|jayam|} udi1ra-

<>according to V. S. Sukthankar, however,
<>“…Jaya is a {%generic%} name applicable to
<>different works, and not a specific name of
<>the Maha1bha1rata at all as believed by some
<>writers” (A1diparvan, p. 989, note on 56. 19);
<>the recitation of this kind of Itiha1sa should
<>be heard by a king who desires victory; he
<>then conquers the earth and shall defeat his
<>enemies; it should also often be heard by a
<>chief queen since it is as good as a rite
<>calculated to lead to the birth of a son ({%pum3-
<>savanam%}) and by a crown prince since it
<>is the royal road to welfare ({%svastyayanam3
<>mahat%}) 1. 56. 19-20; its recitation is re-
<>commended for a king desiring prosperity
<>({%bhu1tim%}), for princes in general, and for
<>any pregnant woman; it is also said that
<>hearing it one who desires heaven will
<>go to heaven, one who wants victory will
<>win victory, and a pregnant woman will
<>deliver a son or a fortunate girl ({%putram3
<>kanya1m3 va1 bahubha1gini1m%}) 18. 5. 39-40; the
<>narrative called the Vidura1putra1nus4a1sana
<>(5. 131-135) is also classed as the Jaya
<>type of Itiha1sa 5. 134. 17; a minister should
<>recite this to a king who is oppressed by his
<>enemies and who is dejected since this tract,
<>being a powerful exhortation, is best suited
<>to cause increase in energy ({%idam uddha-

<>his pupil, in fight; Bhi1s2ma then told her the
<>incidents which had led to the fight; then the
<>river (Gan3ga1) went to Ra1ma to dissuade
<>him; when told that it was Bhi1s2ma who was
<>to be dissuaded, Gan3ga1 returned to Bhi1s2ma
<>and again pleaded with him; but Bhi1s2ma,
<>angered, did not agree to her request 5. 179. [Page330-a+ 40]
<>22-30; Bha1gi1rathi1 again appeared later in
<>this event when she joined the sages, Na1rada
<>and others, who stood between Bhi1s2ma and
<>Ra1ma to stop them fighting with each other
<>5. 186. 27; (3) Her pleading with Amba1:
<>Gan3ga1, the mother of Bhi1s2ma, rose from the
<>waters and asked Amba1 the purpose she
<>wanted to achieve by performing the auste-
<>rities; when told by Amba1 that her effort was
<>aimed at the destruction of Bhi1s2ma, Gan3ga1
<>({%sa1garaga1%}) told her that her purpose was
<>crooked ({%jihmam3 carasi bha1mini%}); if she
<>persisted in observing her vows and if she
<>died during the observance of the vows she
<>would become a crooked river having water
<>only during the rainy season and not in the
<>remaining eight months ({%nadi1 bhavis2yasi
<>s4ubhe kut2ila1 va1rs2ikodaka1/…va1rs2iki1 na1s2t2a-
<>ma1siki1%}); Bhi1sma's mother then returned from
<>the place where Amba1 practised austerities
<>6. 187. 29-36; (4) Death of Bhi1s2ma: When
<>Bhi1s2ma, after his fall on the battle-field,
<>resolved to hold his life till the start of the
<>Uttara1yan2a, Gan3ga1, knowing his resolve,
<>sent to him the great sages in the form of
<>swans 6. 114. 90; much later, after the
<>cremation of Bhi1s2ma, Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and the
<>rest, including Vya1sa, Na1rada, Asita and
<>Kr2s2n2a, went to the bank of the Bha1gi1rathi1
<>and all the Ks2atriya warriors and citizens
<>offered water offerings to him; then Bha1gi1rathi1
<>arose from water and, crying, lamented the
<>death of her son; she addressed her words to
<>the Kauravas praising and recounting the good
<>qualities of Bhi1s2ma 13. 154. 17-26; the
<>grieved Bha1gi1rathi1 was consoled by Da1mo-
<>dara (Kr2s2n2a) assuring her that her son was
<>brought down from the chariot by Arjuna
<>and not by S4ikhan2d2in and that he had return-
<>ed to the Vasus in heaven 13. 154. 27-32; [Page330-b+ 40]
<>Bha1gi1rathi1 then gave up grief and entered
<>her own waters; Kr2s2n2a and others, after
<>honouring the river ({%satkr2tya te ta1m3 saritam%})
<>returned from that place (to Ha1stinapura)
<>when permitted by her to do so ({%anujn5a1ta1s
<>taya1%}) 13. 154. 33-34; when Dhr2tara1s2t2ra had
<>offered water offerings to Bhi1s2ma, Yudhis2t2hira
<>came out of water with Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and,
<>grief-stricken, fell on the bank of the Gan3ga1
<>14. 1. 1-2; (5) Arjuna punished for his role
<>in the fall of Bhi1s2ma: Ulu1pi1 told Arjuna
<>that his defeat at the hands of his son Babhru-
<>va1hana was an expiation ({%nis2kr2tih2%}) he had
<>to undergo for the {%adharma%} committed by him
<>in bringing about the fall of Bhi1s2ma 14. 82. 8;
<>this expiation was prescribed by the Vasus
<>and the Gan3ga1 ({%es2a1 tu vihita1 s4a1ntih2 putra1d
<>ya1m3 pra1ptava1n asi/vasubhir vasudha1pa1la
<>gan3gaya1 ca maha1mate%}) 14. 82. 11; when
<>Bhi1s2ma died ({%hate s4a1ntanave nr2pe%}) the
<>Vasus emerged from waters and meeting the
<>great river, told her that they wanted to
<>curse Arjuna for his misdeed in the war, to
<>which Bha1gi1rathi1 agreed ({%idam u1cur vaco
<>ghoram3 bha1gi1rathya1 mate tada1//…vayam
<>apy arjunam3…s4a1pena yojaya1meti tatha1stv
<>iti ca1bravi1t//%}) 14. 82. 12-15; (6) The
<>Pa1n2d2avas came across the Gan3ga1 at various
<>places: (i) When Yudhis2t2hira and his bro-
<>thers decided to go on a pilgrimage, the
<>Bra1hman2as expressed their wish to visit with
<>them the Gan3ga1 and other rivers 3. 91. 10;
<>when they arrived at Praya1ga at the con-
<>fluence of the Gan3ga1 and the Yamuna1 the
<>Pa1n2d2avas bathed in their waters ({%a1plutya
<>ga1tra1n2i%}), practised the severest austerities
<>and gave gifts to the Bra1hman2as 3. 93. 5-6;
<>(ii) They again arrived at the Bha1gi1rathi1
<>flowing by the side of the Agastya1s4rama
<>where Lomas4a advised them to bathe at [Page331-a+ 40]
<>will ({%yathes2t2am avaga1hyata1m%}) 3. 97. 27;
<>(iii) Going further from the river Kaus4iki1,
<>they arrived at the place where the Gan3ga1
<>met the ocean and bathed there in waters
<>of five hundred rivers ({%nadi1s4ata1na1m3 pan5ca1-
<>na1m3 madhye cakre sama1plavam%}) 3. 114. 2;
<>(iv) On reaching the vicinity of the Maina1ka
<>mountain, Lomas4a showed the river Gan3ga1
<>to Yudhis2t2hira; he advised Yudhis2t2hira to
<>bathe in the Gan3ga1 to be freed of all sins;
<>he also advised him to bathe silently ({%tu1s2n2i1m3
<>gan3ga1m…samupaspr2s4a%}) 3. 135. 5-7; (v)
<>When the Pa1n2d2avas had crossed the Us4i1ra-
<>bi1ja, the Maina1ka, the S4vetagiri and the
<>Ka1las4aila mountains, Lomas4a showed them
<>the Gan3ga1 flowing in seven currents ({%es2a1
<>gan3ga1 saptavidha1%}) 3. 140. 1-2; Lomas4a
<>could hear the sound of the Gan3ga1 on the
<>top on the mountain Ja1mbu1nada 3. 140. 14;
<>(vi) The Pa1n2d2avas saw the Bha1gi1rathi1 on
<>the Kaila1sa mountain; they lived there giving
<>offerings to gods and manes again and again
<>3. 145. 37, 40, 42; (7) Some events after
<>the war and the funeral rites offered to the
<>dead: (i) When Yudhis2t2hira went to meet
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra who had left Ha1stinapura, he
<>saw the Kaurava women lamenting on the
<>bank of the Gan3ga1 11. 11. 5; (ii) Vya1sa,
<>who knew that Ga1ndha1ri1 would curse the
<>Pa1n2d2avas in their first meeting with her after
<>the war, hastened to them after bathing ({%upa-
<>spr2s4ya%}) in the Gan3ga1 11. 13. 4; (iii) After
<>lifting the funeral pyre of Dron2a, his pupils,
<>keeping Kr2pi1 in the front, proceeded to the
<>Gan3ga1 11. 23. 42; (iv) After arranging
<>for the cremation of all the heroes who fell
<>in the war, Yudhis2t2hira, accompanied by
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, went towards the Gan3ga1 11.
<>26. 44; on reaching the Gan3ga1, Yudhis2t2hira
<>and the Kaurava women offered water offerings [Page331-b+ 40]
<>to the departed ({%pracakruh2 salilakriya1h2%});
<>at that moment the Gan3ga1 became easily
<>fordable spreading herself out widely ({%su1pa-
<>ti1rtha1bhavad gan3ga1 bhu1yo viprasasa1ra ca%});
<>the bank of the Gan3ga1 then was without
<>joy and merriment ({%nira1nandam anutsavam
<>…gan3ga1ti1ram as4obhata%}) 11. 27. 1-5; (v)
<>Yudhist2hira, after giving water offerings to
<>Karn2a ({%caka1ra1syodakam3 prabhuh2%} 11. 27.
<>21) and after performing the funeral rites for
<>him with the wives of Karn2a, came out of
<>the river Gan3ga1 ({%sa ta1bhih2 saha dharma1tma1
<>pretakr2tyam anantaram kr2tvo1ttata1ra gan3ga1-
<>ya1h2%}) 11. 27. 24; (vi) When the Pa1n2d2avas,
<>who had given water offerings, were still
<>on the Bha1gi1rathi1, Dvaipa1yana, Narada
<>and others and their pupils and hundreds
<>of thousands of other Bra1hman2as gathered
<>there to console Yudhis2t2hira 12. 1. 1-2,
<>4-5, 8; (8) Cremation of Pa1n2d2u and
<>Ma1dri1: The cremation was performed on
<>an auspicious and even spot in the forest on
<>the river Gan3ga1 ({%raman2i1ye vanoddes4e
<>gan3ga1ti1re same s4ubhe%}); the bier ({%s4ibika1%})
<>in which their dead bodies were brought from
<>Ha1stinapura were placed on this spot 1. 118.
<>16-17; (9) Certain other epic events in
<>which the Gan3ga1 is referred to: (i) At
<>Prama1n2akot2i, Duryodhana tied up Bhi1ma,
<>while he was asleep, and threw him in the
<>waters of the Gan3ga1 1. 55. 10; 3. 13. 74;
<>(ii) Dron2a with his pupils once went to the
<>Gan3ga1 for bathing when a crocodile caught
<>him by his ankle ({%jan3gha1nte%}) 1. 123. 69;
<>(iii) When Drupada was brought captive by
<>his pupils to Dron2a, the latter told Drupada
<>that in future he (Drupada) would rule over
<>the Pan5ca1la country which lay to the south
<>of the Bha1gi1rathi1 while he (Dron2a) himself
<>would rule over the part of the country which [Page332-a+ 40]
<>lay to its north; Drupada then established
<>himself in the capital city of Kampilya in the
<>countryside of Ma1kandi1 on the river Gan3ga1
<>ruling the southern Pa1n5ca1las as far as the
<>river Carman2vati1 1. 128. 12, 15; 1. 154. 24;
<>(iv) Drupada while reaming along the bank
<>of the Ga1n3ga1, came across a settlement of the
<>Bra1hman2as ({%bra1hman2a1vasatha%}) 1. 155. 5;
<>(v) The An3ga1raparn2a episode: The Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas on their way to the Pan5ca1las reached the
<>Somas4rava1yan2a {%ti1rtha%} on the river Gan3ga1;
<>An3ga1raparn2a, king of the Gandharvas, had
<>already arrived there to sport with his wives
<>in the waters of the river Gan3ga1 Bha1gi1rathi1;
<>he was angered when he heard the voice of
<>the Pa1n2d2avas approaching the river; he told
<>the Pa1n2d2avas to leave the place as the forest
<>along the rivers Gan3ga1 and Va1ka1 belonged
<>to him; Arjuna questioned the sole right of
<>the Gandharva over the river either at night,
<>or by day, or in twilight ({%nadya1m asya1m
<>…kasya kl2ptah2 parigrahah2%} 1. 158. 15);
<>it was therefore not proper for the Gan-
<>dharva to withhold the river from others
<>since that was against the age old custom
<>({%katham icchasi ta1m3 roddhum3 nais2a dhar-
<>mah2 sana1tanah2%} 1. 158. 20); why should the
<>Pa1n2d2avas be restrained from touching the
<>waters of the Bha1gi1rathi1 1. 158. 2, 4, 5, 11,
<>13, 15, 20, 21; defeat of An3ga1raparn2a in
<>this episode alluded to in 1. 2. 86; later the
<>Gandharva and the Pa1n2d2avas took leave of
<>each other on the bank of the Bha1gi1rathi1
<>1. 174. 5; (vi) Arjuna, during the period
<>of his exile, entered the river Gan3ga1 for
<>bathing; as he wanted to come out of the
<>water he was dragged by Ulu1pi1 in the water
<>of that river 1. 206. 11-13; (vii) Arjuna,
<>during his exile, while going to the east,
<>crossed many rivers one of them being the [Page332-b+ 40]
<>Gan3ga1 1. 207. 5-6; (viii) Kr2s2n2a, Bhi1ma
<>and Arjuna crossed the rivers Ma1la1, Carman2-
<>vati1 and Gan3ga1 on their way to the Magadha
<>2. 18. 21; (ix) On account of the cries of
<>thousands of animals that were burnt at the
<>Kha1n2d2ava forest the fish in the waters (?)
<>of the Gan3ga1 were terrified 1. 219. 28
<>({%tena s4abdena vitresur gan3godadhicara1
<>jhas2a1h2;%} Ni1. on Bom. Ed. 1. 228. 32: {%gan3go-

<>The Pa1n2d2avas spent their first night of forest
<>life under a banyan tree called Prama1n2a on
<>the river Ja1hnavi1; they bathed in it and had
<>only the water of the Ja1hnavi1 to drink for
<>the night 3. 1. 39-40; from the bank of the
<>river Ja1hnavi1 they started towards the Kuru-
<>ks2etra 3. 6. 1; (xi) On the mountain
<>Himavant Arjuna took bath in the Gan3ga1
<>before ascending Indra's chariot to go to the
<>Indraloka 3. 43. 20; (xii) Bhi1s2ma once
<>lived as a {%muni%} on the bank of the river
<>Bha1gi1rathi1 practising the vow taken by his
<>father ({%pitryam3 vratam%}); there he heard
<>from Pulastya the fruit obtained by visiting
<>the {%ti1rthas%} 3. 80. 11-12; there, on the bank
<>of the Gan3ga1, he also heard the narrative of
<>Vipula from Ma1rkan2d2eya 13. 43. 17; (xiii)
<>When the Pa1n2d2avas were near the Gandha-
<>ma1dana mountain (3. 155. 34) Yudhis2t2hira
<>showed to Bhi1ma the river Maha1gan3ga1 3.
<>155. 69, 85; (xiv) The basket ({%man5ju1s2a1%})
<>containing the newly born Karn2a went down
<>from the river As4vanadi1 to the Gan3ga1 (via
<>the Carman2vati1 and the Yamuna1) and then
<>to the city of Campa1 3. 292. 25-26; when
<>the Su1ta Adhiratha went with his wife to the
<>Ja1hnavi1, she saw there by chance the floating
<>basket brought to the bank by the waves of
<>the Ja1hnavi1 3. 293. 1, 3; (xv) The army of
<>the Kauravas, collected for the war, spread [Page333-a+ 40]
<>along the bank of the Gan3ga1 5. 19. 30;
<>(xvi) Kunti1, who wished to approach Karn2a
<>to tell him the truth about his birth, went
<>to the Bha1gi1rathi1 to meet him; there on the
<>bank of the Gan3ga1 she heard the sound of
<>the prayers recited by Karn2a 5. 142. 26-27;
<>(xvii) Arjuna wishing to propitiate S4iva
<>to seek his help in fulfilling the vow to kill
<>Jayadratha saw the Gan3ga1 on his way 7. 57.
<>24; (xviii) Bhi1ma, in search of As4va-
<>ttha1man, reached the bank of the Bha1gi1rathi1
<>where he saw Vya1sa and the other sages seated
<>on the bank ({%udaka1nte%}) 10. 13. 12-13;
<>(xix) After the great war, Kr2pa, As4vattha1-
<>man and Kr2tavarman, after their meeting
<>with Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, rode fast on horse-back to-
<>wards the Gan3ga1 11. 10. 19; (xx) Bhi1s2ma,
<>having narrated to Yudhis2t2hira the Itiha1sa
<>connected with the praise of the Gan3ga1
<>({%itiha1sam3…gan3ga1ya1h2 stavasam3yutam%}), ad-
<>vised him to approach the Gan3ga1 with great
<>devotion in order to obtain the highest per-
<>fection ({%siddhim uttama1m%}); he and his
<>brothers were delighted to hear this Itiha1sa
<>of the Gan3ga1 from Bhi1s2ma 13. 27. 103-104;
<>(xxi) When Dhr2tara1s2t2ra decided to retire to
<>the forest he, along with Ga1ndha1ri1, Kunti1,
<>Vidura and Sam3jaya, went in a day a long
<>distance from Hastinapura and camped on
<>the bank of the Bha1gi1rathi1; next morning
<>they started from there towards the north
<>15. 24. 16, 23; after going some distance they
<>again camped on the bank of the Bha1gi1rathi1;
<>in the evening he and Ga1ndha1ri1 went to the
<>Gan3ga1 and performed the prescribed puri-
<>ficatory rites ({%caka1ra vidhivac chaucam%});
<>Vidura and other men performed individually
<>all the neccessary rites ({%cakruh2 sarva1h2 kriya1s
<>tatra purus2a1 vidura1dayah2%}) after bathing in
<>the various {%ti1rthas (ti1rthes2v a1plutya);%} when [Page333-b+ 40]
<>the purificatory rites were over Kunti1 led
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Ga1ndha1ri1 to the bank of the
<>Gan3ga1; there the priests of the king laid a
<>Vedi1 ({%kr2to vedi1paristarah2%}) on which Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra gave offerings in the fire; from the
<>bank of the Bha1gi1rathi1 they all proceeded to
<>the Kuruks2etra 15. 25. 1, 4-8; (10) Meet-
<>ing with the dead: Vya1sa asked Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>and all those staying with him to go to the
<>bank of the Bha1gi1rathi1 to meet all those
<>who fell in the war; accordingly all of them
<>went to the Gan3ga1 and resided there 15. 39.
<>18-22; then in the evening Vya1sa bathed in
<>the Bha1gi1rathi1 and invoked all those who
<>fought on the side of the Pa1n2d2avas and the
<>Kauravas; at his call, all the kings, Bhi1s2ma,
<>Dron2a, and the rest, together with their armies,
<>rose in thousands from the water (of the
<>Bha1gi1rathi1) 15. 40. 4, 7, 13; after some time,
<>at the instance of Vya1sa, they again dis-
<>appeared plunging into the river Tripathaga1
<>(Gan3ga1) and repaired to their respective
<>places; then Vya1sa, standing in the water
<>(of the Tripathaga1), told the Kaurava women
<>that those who wished to obtain the worlds
<>of their respective deceased husbands should
<>quickly enter the water of the Ja1hnavi1; the
<>women, fully believing the words of Vya1sa,
<>took permission of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and entered
<>the water of the Ja1hnavi1; freed of their bodies
<>they were united with their husbands and
<>acquired the worlds of their husbands 15.
<>41. 13, 17-21; (11) End of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra,
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 and Kunti1: When Na1rada arrived
<>at Ha1stinapura to meet Yudhis2t2hira he paid
<>a visit to the Gan3ga1 on his way; people
<>residing near the Gan3ga1 had told Yudhi-
<>s2t2hira that Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was engaged in
<>severe austerities; Yudhis2t2hira therefore
<>asked Na1rada if he had met Dhr2tara1s2t2ra [Page334-a+ 40]
<>and the rest during his visit to the Gan3ga1
<>and how they fared; Na1rada told him that
<>after their last meeting with Dhr2tara1s2t2ra the
<>latter had repaired to the Gan3ga1dva1ra; once,
<>after his bath in the Gan3ga1, when Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra had started for his hermitage, wind
<>arose, fire engulfed the forest, and burnt it
<>({%gan3ga1ya1m a1pluto dhi1ma1n a1s4r2ama1bhimukho
<>'bhavat%} 15. 45. 18); Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Ga1ndha1ri1
<>and Kunti1 were burnt in the fire; only Sam3-
<>jaya escaped from the forest fire and was
<>seen, surrounded by ascetics, by Na1rada
<>on the bank of the Gan3ga1 15. 45. 5-6, 10,
<>29-32; Na1rada further informed Yudhis2t2hira
<>that Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was burnt on the bank of
<>the Ja1hnavi1 not by the ordinary fire but by
<>the sacred fire which Dhr2tara1s2t2ra himself
<>and his priests had left after performing the
<>rites (i. e. the forest fire was caused by the
<>sacred fire left by Dhr2tara1s2t2ra) ({%na1sau vr2tha1-
<>gnina1 dagdho yatha1 tatra s4rutam3 maya1%});
<>this was reported to Na1rada by the sages
<>whom he met on the bank of the Bha1gi1rathi1
<>15. 47. 1-6; when asked by Na1rada to give
<>the water offerings to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Ga1ndha1ri1
<>and Kunti1 ({%kartum arhasi kaunteya tes2a1m3
<>tvam udakakriya1m%}), Yudhis2t2hira went to the
<>Gan3ga1 with his brothers and wife; there,
<>going into the water, they all offered water
<>({%dadus toyam%}) and stayed outside the city
<>to undergo purification ({%s4aucam3 nivartaya-
<>ntah2%}) 15. 47. 9-13; (12) Ulu1pi1 entered the
<>Gan3ga1 when, at the end, the Pa1n2d2avas and
<>Draupadi1 started for the forest 17. 1. 25;
<>{@F.@} Past and mythological events in which
<>the river Gan3ga1 figures: (1) Past events:
<>(i) Bhagi1ratha brought her down from the
<>heaven: The sage Kapila had told Am3s4u-
<>mant, the grandson of Sagara, that his
<>grandson will bring down the Tripathaga1 [Page334-b+ 40]
<>from the heaven by propitiating Mahes4vara
<>for the purification of the burnt sons of
<>Sagara 3. 107. 27; however, the descent of
<>the Gan3ga1 from the heaven was first attem-
<>pted by Dili1pa, father of Bhagi1ratha, with-
<>out success 3. 106. 38; Bhagi1ratha, desirous
<>of seeking the favour of the Gan3ga1, went
<>to the Himavant to practise austerities 3.
<>107. 4; after one thousand years the Gan3ga1
<>appeared before Bhagi1ratha in a bodily form
<>3. 107. 14; when requsted by Bhagi1ratha to
<>wash the bones ({%s4ari1ra1n2i%}) of the sons of
<>Sagara so that they might go to heaven,
<>she agreed, but first asked Bhagi1ratha to
<>propitiate S4iva by {%tapas%} so that he might
<>agree to hold her on his head; no one else
<>could check her speed when she descended from
<>heaven; Bhagi1ratha succeeded in securing a
<>boon from S4an3kara to hold the Gan3ga1 3.
<>107. 18-25; S4iva assured Bhagi1ratha to
<>hold the Devanadi1 (Gan3ga1) when she came
<>down from heaven; S4iva then went to the
<>Himavant and asked Bhagi1ratha to request
<>the daughter of the king of the mountains
<>(Gan3ga1 not directly named) to come down
<>from the heaven; when Bhagi1ratha thought
<>of the Gan3ga1 ({%gan3ga1m3 samanucintayat%}
<>3. 108. 5), the river descended from heaven
<>on S4iva's forehead; the river became triple
<>while flowing thence to the ocean ({%sa1 ba-
<>bhu1va visarpanti1 tridha1 ra1jan samudraga1%}
<>3. 108. 10); the river asked Bhagi1ratha to
<>show her the way; Bhagi1ratha led her to the
<>place where lay the bones ({%s4ari1r2a1n2i%}) of the
<>sons of Sagara; after holding the Gan3ga1 on
<>his head Hara went to the Kaila1sa; Bhagi1-
<>ratha having reached the ocean with the
<>Gan3ga1 filled it with the water of the river;
<>Bhagi1ratha made Gan3ga1 his daughter ({%duhi-
<>tr2tve ca nr2patir gan3ga1m3 samanukalpayat%}); [Page335-a+ 40]
<>he offered water of the Gan3ga1 to the manes
<>3. 108. 17; 12. 29. 62; Lomas4a thus told
<>Yudhis2t2hira how the Gan3ga1 came to be Tri-
<>pathaga1 (flowing in three regions-heaven,
<>mid-region, and the earth) and how she was
<>made to descend also to fill the ocean with
<>water ({%pu1ran2a1rtham3 samudrasya pr2thivi1m
<>avata1rita1%}) 3. 108. 2-18; the incident of the
<>descent of the Gan3ga1 on the head of S4iva also
<>alluded to in 5. 109. 6; 6. 7. 28; 13. 27. 71, 87,
<>89, 95; 13. 106. 26; 13. 134. 17; (ii) Other
<>events related to Bhagi1ratha and the Gan3ga1:
<>(a) Gan3ga1 Bha1gi1rathi1 formerly sat on the
<>lap of Bhagi1ratha while he was seated on the

<>Kaus4ika by name, told the truth to the robbers
<>about the whereabouts of the people who
<>were afraid of them; by this act he incurred
<>sin on the river Gan3ga1 12. 110. 8 (reference
<>to 8. 49. 41-46 where in st. 32 Gan3ga1 is
<>not named); (xx) The following persons
<>attained perfection ({%siddhi%}) on the Gan3ga1:
<>(1) S4ilavr2tti, when instructed by Siddha on
<>the virtues of the Tripatha1, worshipped the
<>Gan3ga1 according to the rites and attained
<>perfection which was very difficult to attain;
<>Siddha himself, after instructing S4ilarati,
<>entered the sky 13. 27. 101-102; (2) Sage
<>Sanatkuma1ra attained great perfection on the
<>Gan3ga1 3. 135. 6; (xxi) Indra, in the form
<>of a very weak Bra1hman2a, appeared before
<>Yavakri1 and started doing an impossible
<>deed viz. constructing a dam in the Bha1gi1-
<>rathi1 by filling the Gan3ga1 with sand; he
<>poured constantly handfuls of sand in the
<>Bha1gi1rathi1; when asked by Yavakri1 smilingly
<>why he was busy with this fruitless effort
<>Indra told him that he wanted to construct
<>a dam in the Gan3ga1 so that the river can be
<>crossed easily 3. 135. 30-36; (2) Mytho-
<>logical: (i) Gan3ga1 once went to pay a
<>visit to Pita1maha (Brahmadeva) in his as-
<>sembly; there her garment was displaced by
<>the wind; King Maha1bhis2a, who happened to
<>be there, constantly looked at her in that
<>condition; he was therefore cursed to be born
<>again as a human being; Gan3ga1 returned
<>from the assembly continuing to think about
<>Maha1bhi1s2a; she saw the Vasus, dejected,
<>going along the way; she asked them the
<>cause of their dejection; the Vasus told her [Page337-a+ 40]
<>that they were cursed by Vasis2t2ha to be born
<>as humans; they requested Gan3ga1 to assume
<>a human form so that she could give birth
<>to them as humans; Gan3ga1 agreed and asked
<>them whom would they like to be their father;
<>they chose S4am3tanu, the son of Prati1pa;
<>Gan3ga1 also had thought of the same person,
<>hence she would do what was dear to the king
<>and to the Vasus; Vasus requested Gan3ga1 to
<>throw them into water no sooner they were
<>born; Gan3ga1 agreed to even that request,
<>but asked them to spare one of them so that
<>S4am3tanu's union with her would not be totally
<>fruitless; Vasus consented to do that, each
<>one of them contributing one-eighth share for
<>Gan3ga1's son; and they also told her that the
<>son of the Gan3ga1 would beget no son; having
<>come to this agreement with the Gan3ga1
<>the Vasus, delighted, went their way 1. 91.
<>4-22; (ii) The lustre ({%tejah2%} 13. 84. 11)
<>of Rudra fell in Agni; Agni was to beget
<>through that lustre a son on the Gan3ga1 for
<>killing the enemy of the gods; Agni went
<>to the Gan3ga1 Bha1gi1rathi1 and became mixed
<>with her; as a result, Gan3ga1 became pregnant;
<>Gan3ga1 could not bear the embryo, was men-
<>tally distressed, and was in great agony;
<>when Agni laid the lustrous embryo in the
<>Gan3ga1, an Asura (not named) roared fiercely;
<>terrified, the Gan3ga1 was unable to bear the
<>embryo; Ja1hnavi1, with her body covered with
<>lustre and trembling, told Agni that she could
<>not contain his lustre within her; she was
<>very much uneasy and was agitated; she
<>would like to cast away the embryo, as she
<>could hold it no longer, and not because of
<>her sweet will; she was no longer her usual
<>self; Agni, however, asked her to contain the
<>embryo within her: as she was capable of
<>bearing and containing the whole earth there [Page337-b+ 40]
<>was nothing which Gan3ga1 could not achieve
<>except (perhaps) containing the seed of Agni;
<>in spite of the entreaties of Vahni and the
<>other gods the Gan3ga1 cast off the embryo on
<>mount Meru; Gan3ga1 was capable of holding
<>an embryo, but she could not do it on this
<>occasion as she was overcome by the lustre
<>of Rudra; when she cast it off, she appeared
<>before Agni who asked her if the delivery
<>was happy ({%kaccid garbhah2 sukhodayah2%});
<>he asked her to describe to him the colour,
<>the form and the lustre of the child; having
<>described to Agni the form of his son the god-
<>dess ({%devi1%}) Gan3ga1 disappeared 13. 84. 8, 12,
<>52-72; 9. 43 8-9 (where the embryo is said
<>to have been cast off on the mountain Hima-
<>vant; when the embryo was cast off that part
<>of the mountain became of gold 9. 43. 14);
<>the son Kuma1ra was first Ga1n3geya (son of
<>Gan3ga1), then became Ka1rttikeya (the son of
<>the Kr2ttika1s); the Gan3ga1, the best among the
<>rivers, waited on him 9. 43. 20; when the
<>child approached S4iva, Pa1rvati1, Gan3ga1 and
<>Pa1vaka (Agni) each one of them wondered
<>whom he would show his honour by going to
<>him or her first ({%kim3 nu pu1rvam ayam3
<>ba1lo gaurava1d abhyupais2yati/api ma1m iti
<>sarves2a1m tes2a1m a1si1d manogatam%}) 9. 43.
<>34-35; knowing their mind the child assumed
<>four forms ({%tato 'bhavac caturmu1rtih2%}), of
<>which the form Naigames2a went to the Gan3ga1
<>9. 43. 37, 39; then all the four, Rudra, Devi1,
<>Pa1vaka and the Gan3ga1, bowed down to Pita1-
<>maha (Brahmadeva) and requested him to
<>grant Kuma1ra the overlordship of all beings
<>i. e. of the kings of all the classes of gods
<>({%a1dhipatyam; sena1patyam dadau tasmai

<>des4a1smai sarvabhu1tapita1mahah2%}) 9. 43. 42, [Page338-a+ 40]
<>44, 48, 49; when the gods gave different gifts
<>to Kuma1ra, Gan3ga1 gave him a divine water
<>vessel which was the source of the nectar
<>({%kaman2d2alum3 divyam amr2todbhavam utta-
<>mam%}) 9. 45. 45; people call Kuma1ra diffe-
<>rently the son of Pitamaha, or of Mahes4vara,
<>or of Uma1, or of the Kr2ttika1s, or of the
<>Gan3ga1 9. 45. 86; the incident is also allud-
<>ed to in 3. 207. 4; 13. 27. 87 ({%iyam3 ga1n3ga1

<>performed a {%satra%} in the Naim3is2a forest (3.
<>189. 1), they saw a (golden) lotus coming
<>floating on the river Bha1gi1rathi1; to find out
<>its source, Indra went to the place of the
<>origin of the Gan3ga1 ({%yatra gan3ga1 satatam3
<>sam3prasu1ta1%}); he saw there a woman weeping
<>while standing in the water of the river; the
<>tear which fell in the water became a golden
<>lotus 1. 189. 10-11; (iv) When, in former
<>times, Pita1maha (Brahmadeva) once per-
<>formed a sacrifice on the Mahendra mountain,
<>Bha1gi1rathi1 was present in the {%sadas (yatra

<>(v) When the fish, reared by Manu, outgrew
<>the size of the large {%va1pi1,%} it requested Manu
<>to take it to the Gan3ga1, the chief wife of the
<>ocean ({%samudramahi1s2i1m…gan3ga1m%}); as
<>requested, Manu took the fish to the Gan3ga1
<>and put it in its water; when the fish further
<>so grew in size that it could not move in the
<>Gan3ga1 ({%gan3ga1ya1m3 hi na s4aknomi br2hatva1c

<>it to the ocean; accordingly Manu pulled it
<>out of the Gan3ga1 and took it to the ocean
<>3. 185. 18-19, 21-22; (vi) Na1rada, once
<>early in the morning, descended into the water
<>of the Gan3ga1 arising at the Dhruvadva1ra to
<>take bath ({%pispr2ks2uh2%}); Indra also happened [Page338-b+ 40]
<>to go there; both of them bathed in its water
<>({%a1plutya%}) and, with controlled mind, per-
<>formed {%japa;%} then they sat down on the bank,
<>covered with thin golden sand, to tell each
<>other stories told by gods and sages narrat-
<>ing holy deeds ({%pun2yakarmabhir a1khya1ta1

<>The two rivers, the Gan3ga1 and the Sarasvati1,
<>became the eyebrows of Na1ra1yan2a when he
<>assumed a different form by his mighty device
<>({%ais4varen2a prayogen2a dviti1ya1m3 tanum a1s4ri1-

<>Da1navas Madhu and Kait2abha 12. 335. 43,
<>46; (viii) Mr2tyu, conceived as a woman
<>(12. 249. 15-18), avoiding to kill men, went
<>to the river Gan3ga1 on the mountain Meru
<>and stood there motionless like a piece of
<>wood 12. 250. 22; (ix) Ma1rkan2d2eya saw the
<>Gan3ga1, among other rivers, in the belly of
<>the Ba1la (3. 186. 83, i. e. Na1ra1yan2a 3. 187.

<>to instruct him in the duties of women ({%stri1-
<>dharma%} 13. 134. 10), she first wanted to
<>consult the rivers, the Gan3ga1 and others, who
<>were expert in that subject ({%stri1dharma-

<>they appointed the Gan3ga1 to address Uma1
<>on their behalf; the river told Uma1 that they
<>felt blessed since Uma1 held them in high
<>esteem, but it was indeed Uma1 who was the
<>right person to instruct them in the {%stri1-
<>dharma;%} when the goddess (Uma1) was thus
<>honoured by the Gan3ga1 she discoursed on the
<>{%stri1dharmas%} to them 13. 134. 17-30; (xi)
<>Once, when the ocean asked the rivers why
<>they carried away large trees but not the
<>small and weak cane growing on their banks,
<>the Gan3ga1 told him the reason convincingly

<>Ra1ma crossed (the Gan3ga1) at S4r2n3gaverapura [Page339-a+ 40]

<>shone as before; since the river water was

<>({%dha1nyena ca dhanena ca%}); after the death
<>of Kr2tavi1rya, his kinsmen, when in need
<>of money, asked eminent Bhr2gus to give it
<>since they knew Bhr2gus had wealth; some
<>Bhr2gus, afraid of Ks2atriyas, parted with
<>their wealth, but others hid it underground;
<>when one of the kings was digging the
<>ground he, by chance, found wealth in the
<>house of a Bhr2gu; the assembled Ks2atriyas,
<>due to anger, disregarded the supplications
<>of the Bhr2gus and killed them all with
<>sharp arrows; they killed even children,
<>yet unborn ({%a1 garbha1d anukr2ntantas4…%})
<>(also cf. 13. 56. 3); when Bhr2gus were thus
<>being extirpated their wives took shelter
<>in mountain Himavant; one of them held
<>her embryo in her thigh for the conti-
<>nuation of the line of her husband ({%ta1sa1m
<>anyatama1 garbham3 bhaya1d da1dha1ra taija-

<>breaking the thigh he deprived the Ks2atri1-
<>yas of their eyesight; the Ks2atriyas begged
<>pardon of the Bhr2gu wife 1. 169. 11-22;
<>the Bhr2gupatni1 told the Ks2atriyas that she
<>had not deprived them of their eyesight;
<>that was done by the angry Bha1rgava
<>(Aurva); since the Ks2atriyas started killing
<>even the unborn Bhr2gus she had held her
<>embryo in the thigh for a hundred years;
<>in order to do a favour to the Bhr2gu line-
<>age, the entire Veda along with the six
<>Veda1n3gas entered her child even when he
<>was unborn; the child angered by the death
<>of his ancestors (Bhr2gus) at the hands of
<>Ks2atriyas had deprived them of their
<>eyesight and wished to kill them 1. 170.
<>1-5; Aurva told the Ks2atriyas born in
<>the lineage of Kr2tavi1rya that while he
<>was in the thigh of his mother he had
<>heard the cry of his mothers ({%a1ra1vam3
<>ma1tr2vargasya bhr2gu1n2a1m3%}) due to the
<>killings of Ks2atriya; he was angered
<>because the wretched Ks2atriyas killed
<>Bhr2gus not sparing even those unborn;
<>when nobody offered shelter to the wives
<>of Bhr2gus due to fear, one of them had
<>concealed him in her thigh (1. 171. 5, 6, 8);
<>Aurva practised severe penance to take
<>revenge of the Bhr2gus who were killed
<>by destroying the worlds; he thought he
<>would delight the dead Bhr2gus ({%icchann

<>the dead Bhr2gus then descended from the
<>world of Fathers ({%pitr2loka1d upa1gamya%})
<>and asked him to control his anger; they
<>assured him that the Bhr2gus disregarded [Page812-a+ 40]
<>their getting killed by Ks2atriyas not because
<>of their weakness; they preferred getting
<>killed by Ks2atriyas because they themselves
<>were tired of their long life ({%a1yus2a1 hi

<>house of a Bhr2gu in order to anger Ks2atri-
<>yas; Bhr2gus desired heaven, and had no
<>longing for wealth, however, death was
<>powerless to overtake Bhr2gus and suicide
<>would deprive them from getting good
<>worlds; hence they found some other way
<>out (to get killed by Ks2atriyas); what

<>down in the ditch; if ever the person to

<>he should tell him their plight, ask him to

<>fall down into the hell; neither austerities,
<>nor sacrifices, nor any thing else was equal
<>to a child 1. 41. 3-30; 1. 13. 10-30; Jarat-

<>and cut them off with his skill in shooting
<>arrows ({%as4a1tayat…astrama1yaya1%}); afraid,
<>they all fled 7. 68. 41-45; (10) The same

<>fight with him ({%ma1m eva1bhimukha1h2 sarve

<>fident to defeat them 7. 95. 13-14; in the
<>encounter that followed, S4akas and others
<>showered arrows on Sa1tyaki; he cut off
<>their arrows and killed them by thousands
<>covering the earth with their blood and
<>flesh; those who escaped death fled swiftly
<>in fright; Sa1tyaki thus defeated the large
<>army of S4akas 7. 95. 32-33, 38-39, 45;
<>three thousand horse-riders of S4akas and
<>others, led by Duryodhana, returned to
<>the battlefield to attack Sa1tyaki; he killed
<>many of them 7. 97. 13-14, 20; (11) On

<>Sudaks2in2a, there was fierce fighting ({%ghoram
<>adbhutadars4anam%}) in which S4akas riding
<>horses took part; a large number of them
<>were killed 8. 40. 107-110; later that day,
<>Kr2s2n2a in order to encourage Arjuna told him
<>that S4akas had joined the Kaurava army for

<>he (Arjuna) could defeat them ({%na s4akya1
<>yudhi nirjetum3 tvadanyena param3tapa%}) 8.
<>51. 18, 20; S4akas, who held excellent

<>elephants, rushed at Arjuna to kill him [Page880-b+ 39]
<>({%a1tata1yinah2/s4aka1s…//vara1yudha1n pa1n2iga-

<>Sam3jaya reported to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra the death

<>to kill Arjuna 7. 16. 11, 15-21; the mode of

<>occur Na1ra1yan2as, Gopa1las (7. 17. 31; 7. 18.
<>7), and Yaudheyas (7. 18. 16); (6) On
<>the twelfth day of the war, Dron2a planned a
<>battle between Arjuna and the Sam3s4aptaka
<>troops and when Arjuna left the main battle-
<>field to fight with them, he arranged his
<>army in the Suparn2avyu1ha against Pa1n2d2avas
<>({%vidha1ya yogam3 pa1rthena sam3s4aptaka-

<>arranged their chariots on even ground
<>in the {%vyu1ha%} called Candra1rdha; they were
<>delighted to see Arjuna approaching them
<>for a fight; they roared loudly; Arjuna was
<>surprised to find that they were delighted
<>when actually they should have been
<>grieved; or, he thought, perhaps, they were
<>delighted because they would go to excellent
<>worlds (after death) which were otherwise
<>difficult to be obtained by bad people 7.
<>17. 1-6; hearing the sound of Devadatta
<>conch blown by Arjuna, the army of
<>Sam3s4aptakas became motionless; regaining
<>consciousness they started fighting with
<>Arjuna by showering {%kan3kapatrin%} arrows
<>against him 7. 17. 9-11; the battle des-
<>cribed in which Suba1hu, Sudharman and
<>Sudhanvan also participated 7. 17. 12-22; [Page898-a+ 40]
<>at the death of Sudhanvan, his followers,
<>afraid, ran towards the army of Duryo-
<>dhana 7. 17. 23; Sus4arman, king of Tri-
<>gartas, rebuked those who fled; he remind-
<>ed them of their terrific oaths ({%s4aptva1 tu

<>takas then blew their conches and returned
<>to fight till death ({%mr2tyum3 kr2tva1 nivarta-

<>of Sam3s4aptakas were returning Arjuna asked
<>Kr2s2n2a to drive his chariot towards them;
<>he was determined to kill them 7. 18. 1-3;
<>the Va1yavya1stra released by Arjuna to ward
<>off the arrows of the opponents also blew
<>away a large number of Sam3s4aptakas along
<>with their chariots, horses, elephants and
<>weapons; Arjuna killed a large number of
<>Sam3s4aptakas; their condition as well as the
<>condition of the battle-field described 7. 18.
<>22-37; Dhr2tara1s2t2ra asked Sam3jaya how
<>Arjuna dealt with the army of Sam3s4aptakas
<>({%sam3s4aptakabalam3 prati%}) and how did
<>they encounter him 7. 25. 2; Arjuna left
<>Sam3s4aptakas for a while to fight with
<>Bhagadatta who was routing the Pa1n2d2ava
<>army; fourteen thousand Sam3s4aptakas
<>followed him and challenged him; Arjuna
<>hesitated for a while whether to fight with
<>Sam3s4aptakas or go to help Yudhis2t2hira;
<>ultimately he decided to kill Sam3s4aptakas
<>(first) ({%abhavad bhuyasi1 buddhih2 sam3s4a-
<>ptakavadhe sthira1%}); the great Sam3s4aptaka
<>chariot-fighters ({%sam3s4aptakamaha1ratha1h2%})
<>discharged numerous smooth arrows ({%s4ata-
<>sahasra1n2i s4ara1n2a1m3 nataparvan2a1m3%}) on
<>Arjuna with the result that, covered with
<>the arrows, neither Arjuna, nor Kr2s2n2a, nor
<>his horses, nor chariot, could be seen; when
<>Kr2s2n2a was deluded ({%moham anupra1ptah2…
<>jana1rdanah2%}) Arjuna killed Sam3s4aptakas [Page898-b+ 40]
<>with Vajra1stra 7. 26. 10, 12-14, 18-20; the
<>condition of Sam3s4aptakas described 7. 26.
<>21-27; having killed Sam3s4aptakas Arjuna
<>asked Kr2s2n2a to drive his chariot towards
<>Bhagadatta 7. 26. 29; but Sus4arman and
<>his Sam3s4aptaka brothers followed Arjuna
<>challenging him for a fight ({%yuddha1rthi1
<>pr2s2thato 'nvaya1t//…sus4arma1hvayate
<>'cyuta//%}); Arjuna therefore was again in
<>doubt-whether to kill Sam3s4aptakas first
<>or to go to the aid of his side 7. 27. 2-5;
<>he asked Kr2s2n2a to turn back and started
<>fighting with Sus4arman; his battle with
<>Sam3s4aptaka brothers described in which
<>Sus4arman swooned 7. 27. 7-10; later,
<>Arjuna continued to kill the surviving Sam3-
<>s4aptakas and Na1ra1yan2as on the southern
<>side of the army ({%daks2in2ena tu sena1ya1h2
<>kurute kadanam3 bali/sam3s4aptaka1vas4es2asya

<>killing the Sam3s4aptakas, Arjuna returned to
<>attack Dron2a and the Kaurava army 7. 31.
<>41-44; (7) On the thirteenth day, when
<>Dron2a reitereted the necessity of removing
<>Arjuna from the main battle, Sam3s4apta-
<>kas renewed their challenge to Arjuna and
<>took him away to the south of the battle-
<>field ({%a1hvayann arjunam3 sam3khye daks2in2a1m
<>abhito dis4am%}) 7. 32. 15; towards the end
<>of the day, Arjuna proceeded towards his
<>camp after killing Sam3s4aptakas 7. 50. 1-3;
<>Yudhis2t2hira, grieved over the death of
<>Abhimanyu, told Arjuna that after he left
<>to fight with the Sam3s4aptaka army, Dron2a
<>made a serious attempt to capture him 7.
<>51. 1; (8) On the fourteenth day, at
<>the instance of Duryodhana, the army
<>of Kauravas, along with Sam3s4aptakas,
<>returned to fight with Sa1tyaki with great
<>determination ({%te punah2 sam3nyavartanta [Page899-a+ 40]
<>kr2tva1 sam3s4aptaka1n mithah2%}) 7. 97. 12; when
<>Duh2s4a1sana was wounded by Sa1tyaki,
<>Duryodhana asked Trigartas to fight with
<>Sa1tyaki; Sam3s4aptakas again made a deter-
<>mined effort to attack Sa1tyaki; Sa1tyaki
<>killed their five hundred chief warriors,
<>showering arrows on them, at the head of
<>the army ({%agra1ni1ke vyapothayat%}) 7. 99.
<>3-7; their condition described 7. 99. 8-11;
<>ultimately they retreated in the direction of
<>Dron2a 7. 99. 12; (9) When Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>was told that on the sixteenth day, angry
<>Arjuna attacked the Sam3s4aptaka troops
<>({%sam3s4aptakagan2a1n%} 8. 9. 8) he wished to
<>know the details of the fight between Sam3-
<>s4aptakas and Arjuna; Arjuna entered the
<>large ocean-like troops of Sam3s4aptakas
<>({%sam3s4aptakagan2am3…arn2avasam3nibham%})
<>and agitated it ({%vyaks2obhayat%}); the fight
<>in which Arjuna cut off the hands and heads
<>of his opponents with sharp arrows and
<>killed elephants and horses along with their
<>riders as well as chariot-fighters was hair-
<>raising ({%lomahars2an2am%}) 8. 12. 1, 3-13; at
<>that point As4vattha1man challenged Arjuna;
<>hence he asked Kr2s2n2a whether he should
<>continue killing Sam3s4aptakas or accept the
<>challenge of As4vattha1man: Kr2s2n2a drove
<>him to As4vattha1man 8. 12. 21-22; after
<>fighting with As4vattha1man, Arjuna return-
<>ed to Sam3s4aptaka horse-riders, chariot-
<>fighters, elephant-riders and foot-soldiers
<>({%tatah2 sam3s4aptaka1n bhu1yah2 sa1s4vasu1taratha-

<>described in which Arjuna killed all kinds
<>of his opponents ({%sam3s4aptakamaha1rn2avam/
<>vyas4os2ayata duh2s4os2am…%}) and returned
<>to fight with As4vattha1man 8. 12. 37-43, 47;
<>after fighting for a while with him, Arjuna
<>came back to Sam3s4aptakas; he cut off the [Page899-b+ 40]
<>hands, heads, weapons etc. of the opponents
<>who did not turn back ({%apara1n3mukha1na1m%})
<>8. 12. 54-58; after Arjuna's one more
<>encounter with As4vattha1man in which the
<>latter was removed from the battle by his
<>horses, Arjuna continued his battle with
<>Sam3s4aptakas 8. 12. 70-71; when there was
<>loud noise to the north of the battle-field
<>(8. 13. 1), Kr2s2n2a advised Arjuna to go
<>there and first fight with Ma1gadha Dan2d2a-
<>dha1ra; he could later kill the Sam3s4aptakas
<>8. 13. 4; accordingly, Arjuna first killed
<>Dan2d2adha1ra and his elephant and came
<>back to Sam3s4aptakas 8. 13. 25; in the
<>battle that followed, Arjuna killed many
<>Sam3s4aptakas, while Kr2s2n2a drove his chariot
<>in various roundabout ways ({%vakra1nuva-
<>kragamana1t%}) 8. 14. 1; the battle described
<>8. 14. 2-21; at that moment Kr2s2n2a advised
<>Arjuna not to while away his time with
<>Sam3s4aptakas; he should kill them without
<>loss of time and hasten to kill Karn2a
<>({%kim3 kri1d2ase 'nagha/sam3s4aptaka1n prama-
<>thyaita1m3s tatah2 karn2avadhe tvara%}); Arjuna
<>agreed and killed quickly the remaining
<>Sam3s4aptakas ({%ks2ipram3 s4is2t2a1n sam3s4apta-
<>ka1m3s tada1/a1ks2ipya s4astren2a bala1d…
<>avadhi1t%}) 8. 14. 22-23; Trigartas, along with
<>S4a1lvas, Sam3s4aptakas, and Na1ra1yan2as, led
<>by the king of Trigartas and his brothers,
<>attacked Arjuna 8. 19. 2-4; the battle, in
<>which Sam3s4aptakas were killed by hundreds
<>and thousands ({%s4atas4o 'tha sahasras4ah2%} 8.
<>19. 19) and at one stage they surrounded
<>Arjuna and showered him with weapons,
<>described 8. 19. 5-34; in the end almost
<>the entire Sam3s4aptaka army turned back
<>and did not stay to face Arjuna ({%pra1yas4o
<>vimukham3 sarvam3 na1vatis2t2hata sam3yuge%});
<>Arjuna thus won victory over many Sam3- [Page900-a+ 40]
<>s4aptaka troops ({%sam3s4aptakagan2a1n bahu1n%})
<>8. 19. 34-35; (10) On the seventeenth
<>day, thirtyfour thausand chariot-fighters of
<>S4am3s4aptakas determined to fight to the end
<>stood on the left side of the Ba1rhaspatya-
<>vyu1ha of Kauravas ({%catustrim3s4atsahasra1n2i

<>drew attention of Karn2a to Sam3s4aptakas

<>on all sides making Arjuna invisible
<>({%sam3s4aptakaih2 kruddhaih2…channah2 pa1rtho

<>asked Sam3jaya to describe to him the
<>battle between Arjuna and Sam3s4aptakas;
<>Sam3jaya told him that when the armies
<>were arrayed ({%atha vyu1d2hes2v ani1kes2u%}),
<>Arjuna attacked Sam3s4aptakas; wishing
<>to kill Arjuna and determined to win
<>victory not minding death ({%vijaye kr2ta-
<>sam3kalpa1 mr2tyum3 kr2tva1 nivartanam%}) they
<>rushed towards Arjuna; their army consi-
<>sted of many horses, elephants, chariot-
<>fighters and foot-soldiers; a fierce battle
<>then took place; Arjuna cut off their hands,
<>holding different weapons, as well as their
<>heads; thinking Arjuna's chariot was
<>drowned in the large army, Sam3s4aptakas
<>delightfully raised a roar ({%tasmin sainye
<>maha1varte…/nimagnam3 tam3 ratham3 matva1
<>neduh2 sam3s4aptaka1 muda1/%}) 8. 32. 1-13; at
<>the site where Arjuna was killing Sam3s4apta-
<>kas a loud sound of Ga1n2d2i1va was heard;
<>very much angered Sam3s4aptakas, coveting
<>victory ({%jayagr2ddha1h2 pramanyavah2%}) sho-
<>wered arrows on Arjuna; Arjuna braved
<>their attack and reached Sus4arman; when [Page900-b+ 40]
<>Arjuna started showering arrows on Sus4ar-
<>man, Sam3s4aptakas responded the same way;
<>hearing the roar of the monkey on Arjuna's
<>chariot, the army of Sam3s4aptakas was much
<>terrified and became motionless; regain-
<>ing consciousness, the warriors showered
<>arrows on Arjuna and covered his chariot;
<>they held firmly the horses, the wheels and
<>the shaft of Arjuna's chariot and roared
<>loudly ({%te haya1n rathacakre ca rathes2a1s4
<>ca1pi bha1rata/nigr2hya balavat%}); some
<>mounted on Arjuna's chariot and held him
<>and Kr2s2n2a; shaking his hands Kr2s2n2a felled
<>them down; Arjuna saw Sam3s4aptaka great
<>chariot-fighters encircling him and holding
<>his chariot and Kr2s2n2a; he felled many of
<>them down who had mounted the chariot
<>and other foot-soldiers who were close to
<>him by shooting arrows which went short
<>distances ({%apa1tayat/a1sanna1m3s4 ca tato
<>yodha1n5 s4arair a1sannayodhibhih2%}); he made
<>the rest run away; Arjuna pointed out to
<>Kr2s2n2a that he had killed thousands of
<>Sam3s4aptakas who had achieved the difficult
<>task of checking his chariot ({%kurva1n2a1n
<>da1run2am3 karma…rathabandham3 imam3/
<>ghoram3%}); Arjuna and Kr2s2n2a blew Deva-
<>datta and Pa1n5cajanya conches respy.;
<>hearing that sound, the Sam3s4aptaka army
<>shook and became very much afraid ({%sam3-
<>caca1la…vitrasta1 ca1bhavad bhr2s4am%});
<>Arjuna then bound their feet by releasing
<>{%na1ga1stra;%} he killed them in that condition;
<>when they were being killed, they gave up
<>fighting with Arjuna and threw down their
<>weapons; then Sus4arman released them
<>from their bonds by using {%sauparn2a1stra;%}
<>once free, they showered arrows and
<>weapons on Arjuna ({%sasr2jur ba1n2asam3-
<>gha1m3s4 ca s4astrasam3gha1m3s4 ca%}); Arjuna cut [Page901-a+ 40]
<>off the missiles with arrows and killed many
<>elephants, horses and chariot-fighters by
<>using {%aindra1stra;%} the troops of Sam3s4aptakas
<>and Na1ra1yan2as were then very much afraid;
<>no one was able to fight back Arjuna ({%na
<>hi kas4cit puma1m3s tatra yo 'rjunam3 pratya-

<>the opposing warriors; fourteen thousand
<>(foot) warriors, an {%ayuta%} of chariot-
<>fighters, and three thousand elephant-
<>riders of Sam3s4aptakas who survived ({%ya1ni
<>s4is2t2a1ni%}) once again surrounded Arjuna
<>determined either to return with victory
<>or die ({%martavayam iti nis4citya jayam3 va1pi

<>fought between them and Arjuna (8. 37.
<>1-38); Arjuna destroyed many Sam3s4apta-
<>kas; their Ks2atriyas, tormented by him,
<>were killed ({%te ks2atriya1 dahyama1na1s…
<>jagmur vina1s4am%}) 8. 40. 5-61 after killing
<>many Sam3s4aptaka troops ({%nihatya…sam3-
<>s4aptakagan2a1n bahu1n%}), Arjuna pointed out
<>to Kr2s2n2a the great Sam3s4aptaka chariot-

<>away as they were unable to resist his
<>arrows ({%dha1vanti sagan2a1h2 sam3s4aptakamaha1-
<>ratha1h2/apa1rayanto madba1n2a1n%}) 8. 40. 78-
<>80; Duryodhana again incited Sam3s4aptakas
<>to face Arjuna; then a thousand chariot-
<>fighters, three hundred elephant-riders,
<>fourteen thousand horse-riders and two
<>hundred thousand archers turned towards
<>Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna covering them with
<>arrows; but Arjuna killed ten thousand
<>Sam3s4aptakas 8. 40. 92-99; thus Arjuna
<>completely destroyed ({%kr2tsnena vyadha-
<>mat%}) the Sam3s4aptakas 8. 40. 130; when
<>the armies of Kurus and Sr2n5jayas met
<>again only a few Sam3s4aptakas had surs
<>vived ({%sam3s4aptakes2u…kim3cicchis2t2es2u%}); [Page901-b+ 40]
<>Arjuna, after defeating As4vattha1man (8.

<>s4aptakas since fighting with them was his
<>main task ({%ka1ryam etat param3 mama%}) 8.
<>42. 3, 56; Arjuna killed the remaining Sam3-
<>s4aptaka troops with sharp arrows with the
<>result that they became the guests of Indra
<>and became free from grief as they were
<>happy ({%s4akrasya1tithita1m gatva1 vis4oka1 hy

<>told Bhi1ma that he could not leave the
<>battlefield (to go to enquire about Yudhi-
<>s2t2hira) without killing Sam3s4aptakas who
<>faced him, Bhi1ma assured him that he
<>himself would fight with the Sam3s4aptakas
<>8. 45. 63-64; Arjuna while explaining to
<>Yudhis2t2hira why he had not yet killed
<>Karn2a told him that during his fight with
<>Sam3s4aptakas, As4vattha1man had unexpec-
<>tedly intervened (to distract him) 8. 47.
<>2; later, while boasting about his heroic
<>deeds Arjuna mentioned that he had killed
<>almost all Sam3s4aptakas and only a few of
<>them had survived ({%sam3s4aptaka1na1m3 kim3cid
<>eva1vas4is2t2am%}) 8. 49. 96; at one stage, Duh2s4a1-
<>sana along with the fully equipped army of
<>Sam3s4aptakas ({%pr2tana1 samr2ddha1%}) attacked
<>Bhi1ma 8. 53. 9; when Arjuna was proceeding
<>towards Karn2a, Sam3s4aptaka chariot-fighters
<>attacked him showering arrows; Arjuna
<>killed many of them along with their chari-
<>oteers, and cut off their bows and banners
<>with sharp arrows; they all fell down from
<>their chariots 8. 59. 3-5; (11) On the
<>seventeenth day, at night, when Sam3jaya
<>reported to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra the death of Karn2a
<>(8. 1. 25), he (Dhr2tara1s2t2ra), while recalling

<>question who of the Kurus were still alive

<>8. 4. 3, Sam3jaya mentioned Sam3s4aptaka

<>assuming an agreeable form ({%saumyena

<>show that kind of favour to the Bra1hman2a
<>which would lead him to happiness ({%asya1-

<>the gods, Man2ibhadra told Kun2d2adha1ra
<>that he was willing to give the Bra1hman2a
<>as much wealth as desired by him; Kun2d2a- [Page936-b+ 40]
<>dha1ra then, reflecting that a man's (wealth)
<>was fickle, decided to fix the Bra1hman2a's

<>persisted on giving the Bra1hman2a kingdom

<>ing {%dharma,%} Kun2d2adha1ra did not change
<>his mind and wanted his Bra1hman2a devotee
<>to live following the {%dharma;%} the gods
<>were pleased with him; Man2ibhadra told
<>Kun2d2adha1ra that the gods were satisfied
<>with him and that the Bra1hman2a's mind
<>would be fixed on {%dharma%} and that he would
<>be a {%dharma1tma1;%} Kun2d2adha1ra was delight-
<>ed for having obtained what was desired in
<>the form of a boon not easily obtained by
<>others; the Bra1hman2a saw thin garments
<>around him but his mind was not deluded;
<>abandoning them, he went to the forest
<>and practised severe austerities; he felt that
<>if he so desired he could certainly give
<>some one even kingdom (12. 263. 30-39);
<>at that juncture Kun2d2adha1ra again appeared
<>before the Bra1hman2a due to his friendship
<>with him and the severe austerities per-
<>formed by him; the Bra1hman2a, surprised,
<>received him according to the rites; Kun2d2a-
<>dha1ra told the Bra1hman2a that he had now
<>obtained the highest divine insight ({%divyam3 [Page937-a+ 40]
<>te caks2ur uttamam%} 12. 263. 42) and by
<>using it the Bra1hman2a should see the ulti-

<>they would get; then the Bra1hman2a by his
<>divine eye saw thousands of kings sunk in
<>the hell; Kun2d2adha1ra wondered that if the
<>Bra1hman2a, after worshipping him was to
<>get unhappiness, what kind of favour had
<>he done to him ? He therefore asked the
<>Bra1hman2a (to use his divine eye and) to
<>realize that it was futile to run after various
<>longings because the door to heaven was
<>closed for such men ({%ka1ma1n icched katham3

<>then saw that lust, anger, greed, fear,
<>arrogance, sleep, drowsiness, laziness hinder
<>men from going to heaven ({%tato 'pas4yat sa
