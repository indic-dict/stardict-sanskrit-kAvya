This file describes the coding conventions of the data files.
This file is encoded in utf-8 encoding.

The original digitization is file pui_orig.txt, which is
coded in the cp1252 (windows 1252) encoding,
and is best viewed in a text editor which supports this encoding.
For example, in Emacs, one may use the command
revert-buffer-with-coding-system
and then select cp1252 as the coding.
The internet reference http://www.cp1252.com/ describes this coding system.

The file pui_orig_utf8.txt is a conversion of pui_orig.txt to the
more common utf-8 encoding.
(April 2, 2015) The file pui_orig_utf8_slp1.txt contains the same data, but
  has Devanagari coded in SLP1 transliteration.  It is the basis of further
  corrections.
The file pui.txt is also in the utf-8 encoding, and incorporates various
editing changes, such as corrections of typographical errors.

There are several extended ascii codes occurring in pui.txt:
©  (\u00a9)     2 := COPYRIGHT SIGN
×  (\u00d7)     7 := MULTIPLICATION SIGN
‘  (\u2018)    27 := LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
’  (\u2019)    32 := RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
“  (\u201c)    10 := LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
”  (\u201d)     9 := RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
„  (\u201e)     1 := DOUBLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK



The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}     3 : {#X#} devanagari text, coded with HK (only 3 lines)
              (April 2, 2015) X coded as SLP1
{@X@}    10 : bold text
{%X%} 23153 : italic text 
{??}      5 : unreadable text

The following  <x> type tags are found in pui.txt:
<F>X</F>  8890  : Footnote 
<>       23812  : start of new line
<P>      32843  :  start of new paragraph
<H>         41  : Title line
<HI>        20  : sub-title line

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks have the form [PageV-PPP+ n], where
V is the volume (1,2 or 3)
PPP is the page (within volume)
n is the number of lines in the new page

The lines of the digitization  represent lines of the text.

Headword are coded as
<P>{%X%} Where X is in AS encoding of European transliteration of Sanskrit.

Here is the regular expression used in python programs to recognize headwords;
it is in headword.py.
reHeadword = r'^<P>{%(.*?)%}'


The headwords are ordered according to Sanskrit alphabet ordering.


Most Sanskrit in the text appears in the European Indological form, which is
coded in pui.txt with the the AS (Anglicized Sanskrit) coding.

The general AS scheme, as described in CDSL.pdf, uses Latin alphabetical
letters 'x (a-z,A-Z), possibly with suffixed numbers; the letter-number
combinations are, in the general scheme:
x1 = macron
x2 = dot below
x3 = dot above
x4 = accent aigu
x5 = tilde
x6 = dash below
x7 = umlaut
x10 = circonflex (hat)
x11 = accent grave

Here are the characters that occur in pui.txt in this coding,
with their approximate frequency.
