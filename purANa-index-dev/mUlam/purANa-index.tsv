She said that S4iva had burnt down her husband. On this Uma1's father did not like the idea of giving his daughter to such an ill-tempered person. Uma1 requested permis- sion to do penance and was allowed. Indra at this time thought of the seven sages to bring about S4iva's marriage with Uma1. The sages were satisfied of her steadfast love to S4iva and had his consent for the marriage; celestial women dressed Uma1, as also the god S4iva; amidst divine music, the couple went to the city of Maha1girinagara and Brahma1 officiated as priest: After the marriage they left for Mandaragiri. <F>8:  M. 154. 276-496.</F> Once Uma1 made a doll with elephant face and dropped it in the Ganges.

He was sent for and nursed by Uma1. <F>11:  M. 154. 522-555.</F> Touched by Goddess of Night, she became black in colour. S4iva found fault with her and after reproaching him with his past deeds, she left him for penance. Vi1raka appealed to her when she said she would return as Gauri1. She asked Vi1raka to see that no lady entered her harem. Meanwhile A1d2i, son of Andhaka1sura entered S4iva's abode in the guise of Uma1 but was slain by S4iva. Hearing from Va1yu that a lady entered her home, she cursed Vi1raka to be born on the earth; out of her rage came out a lion which Brahma1 gave to the Goddess of Night, who was asked to leave Uma1 for the Vindhya hills. Now Uma1 became Gauri1 and entered S4iva's abode when Vi1raka stopped her, as he did not at first recognise her. Convinced of his mother's identity, he requested her to recall her curse and was assured of a place in Devagan2a. <F>12:  M. 154. 588; chap. 155- 58.</F> While Uma1 was sporting with S4iva, Agni entered the harem in the form of a parrot.

He at once drew his sword to slay Devaki1 when Vasudeva entreated him to spare her life promising to give him all her sons. To this he agreed. He did not take notice even of the first boy. Subsequently Na1rada confirmed what he heard from the welkin. So he killed all her sons and put her and Vasudeva in jail. He waited for the seventh and was particularly afraid of the eighth. Being informed of the birth of a girl, and without listening to his sister's appeal to spare the baby, he dashed it against a stone. It flew heavenwards and said that the baby born to vanquish him [Page1-293+ 43] was safe. Disheartened, Kam2sa let Vasudeva and Devaki1 free.

He summoned his councillors and asked the Mallas, Ca1n2u1ra and Mus2t2ika to get ready for a wrestling match with Kr2s2n2a and Ra1ma; ordered his mahout to station the State Elephant at the gate of the enclosure {%(Ran3ga)%} and get Kr2s2n2a and Ra1ma trampled under its feet; when he was asked why he was out to kill those two boys, he narrated the story of his mother once going in the garden thinking of her husband Ugrasena. Then a Gandharva Drumila per- sonated Ugrasena. Discovering that he was not her hus- band, she asked him in wrath who he was. He tried to console her saying that she would give birth to a heroic son. The chaste lady retorted that he would be cruel and un- righteous. Such being his birth, he hated his kith and kin. Then he commanded to commence the {%Dhanurya1ga.%} Akru1ra was sent for and ordered to take his chariot and bring Kr2s2n2a and Ra1ma to the {%Dhanurya1ga%} with all gopas.

Became furious at the death of his five mallas and the running away of others. Ordered the banishment of the two brothers, robbing the gopas of their belongings, and imprisonment of Nanda, killing of Ugrasena and Vasudeva.

So he was bound with a rope to an {%ulu1khala%} (mortar) but the rope always fell two inches [Page1-437+ 40] short in spite of bits being added. At last Kr2s2n2a pitied her and allowed himself to be tied; with the mortar he passed between two tall Arjuna trees, when down fell the trees, out of which emerged two men Nalakubera and Man2igri1va (sons of Kubera) who had been cursed by Na1rada.

On another occasion Asura Baka met him in the guise of a crane, when Kr2s2n2a tore its jaws asunder. Once when in the forest with his playmates, Agha, an asura friend of Kam2sa1 took the form of a boa-constrictor with a view to devour the cattle and all boys together. All of them entered his open mouth with Kr2s2n2a who took his life out of his body and came out to the wonderment of gods. The {%aja1gara%} skin when dried was a cave for Vraja people. Agha, however, attained salva- tion. <F>11:  Bha1. X. Chap. II.</F> One day the boys sat and ate merrily when the cattle had gone far into the hill and dale and Kr2s2n2a promised to bring them back. In the meantime Brahma1 had them hidden. So Kr2s2n2a created duplicates of the cattle and the children that had been lost. These went home as usual and this continued for a year, when Brahma1 released the hidden cows which suckled their calves, and came to see the child, the one Brahman without a second, and belauded the baby Hari, and returned to his region. More boyhood sports. <F>12:  Ib. X. Chaps. 13 and 14; Vi. V. 6. 30 to the end of Chap. 9.</F> In regularly tending cows, imitated voice of beasts and birds in Brinda1vana just like a rustic. Once the cattle drank of the poisonous waters of the Yamuna1 and became unconscious. After reviving them he found the reptile Ka1li1ya in the waters. He immediately jumped into the pool and was enclosed in its coils. At this Nanda and the whole Vraja moved to the banks of the river with great concern. [Page1-438+ 39] Ra1ma advised them to be cool. Slowly Kr2s2n2a brought the reptile under his control, and getting on its hood, began to dance, when the Ka1li1ya acknowledged defeat. Finding his end near, Ka1li1ya's wives prayed to Kr2s2n2a to spare him. The generous Lord allowed him to make his abode in the sea, thus purifying the Yamuna1 once for all. <F>13:  Bha1. X. Chaps. 15 and 16. Vi. V. 7 (whole).</F> After this incident the whole Vraja was encamped for the night in that vicinity. A forest fire attacked the camp, when Kr2s2n2a swallowed it and protected its inmates. His dances and songs; other past-times. Among the games was one in which the victor rode on the back of the vanquished. Kr2s2n2a carried S4ri1da1ma on his back. <F>14:  Bha1. X. Chaps. 17 and 18.</F> Once again the cattle went astray in the thick forest, and surrounded by fire they bellowed in thirst and hunger. Kr2s2n2a and his playmates found it impossible to reach the spot. So Kr2s2n2a got upon a tree and called the cattle by names, and they responded. Asking his followers to shut their eyes, he swallowed the forest fire. When they opened their eyes, they found themselves in their homes. <F>15:  Ib. X. 19. 1-13.</F> Kr2s2n2a filled Brinda1vana with Ga1ndharvan music and played at times on flute. Hid the clothes of Gopis who observed {%Ka1tya1yani vrata%} to get him as their husband, and returned them only when they saluted with their two hands over their heads as a penance for bathing naked during the period of a {%vrata.%} It was a severe day in summer when some Gopas approached him for food. Kr2s2n2a advised them to go to the neighbouring {%yajn5as4a1la%} and ask for food, sing- ing the praises of Balara1ma and himself. The sacrificers were silent at their request. Kr2s2n2a asked them to repeat their request to ladies in his name. The ladies took four kinds of food and in spite of protest by their male relations, they came to have {%darsan%} of the Lord and placed before Him all the eatables. On Kr2s2n2a's advice they went back to com- plete the sacrifice, and assured them of their being accepted by their relations and the world. Their male relations [Page1-439+ 39] regretted having missed a chance of meeting the Lord. Then food was distributed among his friends. <F>16:  Bha1. X. Chaps. 21-23.</F> Kr2s2n2a saw the Gopas worshipping Indra and as resi- dents of hills and forests, he suggested worship of mountains and cows. When this was accepted, Indra sent a heavy downpour which was warded off by Kr2s2n2a, a boy of seven, <F>17:  Ib. X. Chaps. 24-26; Vi. V. 10. 25-41; 11. 16-25; 13. 3-62.</F> holding up the Govardhana for a week. A visit from Indra and Surabhi who anointed him, Indra, of Goloka and gave him a new name Govinda. Rescued his father Nanda from Varun2a region and took him with other Gopas to Brahma- h2rada where the Vedas were praising Hari. Once when playing on a flute, the Gopi1s who were in the midst of house- hold duties stopped them and came to where he was in spite of protest from their male relations. Kr2s2n2a advised them to go back to Vraja and be loyal to their husbands. They refused to return as their minds were fixed upon him and longed for {%moks2a,%} and insisted they were his {%da1sis%} and should be accepted. After some time he disappeared for their peace and redemption. They indulged in {%gi1tam,%} when the Lord appeared in their midst and shone like {%Purus2a%} among {%s4aktis.%} After consoling them he engaged them in a {%ra1sakri1d2a,%} and finding them wearied, he engaged them in watersports and sports in the {%upavana%} on the river-bank. There was no carnal act of sin. The Lord who had no {%bandha,%} did all this in sport. <F>18:  Bha1. X. Chaps. 27-33; Vi. IV. 12. 12.</F> Released Nanda from a reptile who turned out to be vidya1dhara Sudars4ana. One day S4ankhacu1da a follower of Kam2sa1 seized some ladies of Kr2s2n2a's party and ran away. They cried for succour. Kr2s2n2a and Ra1ma followed. He left the women behind and ran. Ra1ma took charge of the ladies while Kr2s2n2a pursued him, cut off his head and took the cu1d2a1man2i which he presented to Ra1ma. Killed Ari1s2t2a in the form of a bull who entered the Vraja and terrified the inmates. <F>19:  Bha1. X. Chaps. 34-36; Vi. V. Chap. 14.</F> [Page1-440+ 37] Killed Kes4in who came to the Vraja in the guise of a horse and became Kes4ava; killed one Vyoma in the guise of a gopa1la; seen milking cows with Ra1ma by Akru1ra who came to Dva1raka1 at the instance of Kam2sa1; agreed readily to start for Mathura1 at Akru1ra's message. With Akru1ra, the two brothers arrived at Mathura1. and asked their friend to go home. He requested them to visit his house to which they agreed only after vanquishing Kam2sa1. Next day afternoon, the two brothers and their Gopa followers went round the city and the women from terraces enjoyed the sight of Kr2s2n2a and Ra1ma. On the way he met a washerman and asked for good clothes. On his refusal, he was killed, and all his clothes taken and distributed to his Gopas. Then they met a garland-maker Suda1ma who voluntarily offered flower- garlands. Him he blessed and went. Next he saw a hunch- back woman carrying unguents to Kam2sa1. For the mere asking she offered the whole of it to them. So Kr2s2n2a con- verted her to a handsome lady who invited him to her house. This was agreed after finishing his work. Then they went through the bazaar and were rewarded with betels, sandal, etc., by merchants. Lastly they entered the place where the bow festival was held. Kr2s2n2a broke it easily.

Hearing that Sa1ndi1pani's son was washed away by the sea at Prabha1sa1, Kr2s2n2a went to the spot and was told by the seagod that an Asura Pan5cajana carried him off. Then he went to Yama's abode, and recovering his son, handed him over to the {%guru%} as {%gurudaks2in2a%} and came home.

Entering Pra1gjyotis2a, Kr2s2n2a pulled down ramparts and walls and cut off Mura's five heads. His seven sons attacked him led by Pa1t2ha in vain. Naraka also attacked and had his head cut off. Kr2s2n2a entered the city welcomed by its people, saw Man2iparvata of Indra and the umbrella of Varun2a and gave them back to them. Earth, mother of Naraka came before Kr2s2n2a and handed over the {%kun2d2alas%} of Aditi, informing him that Naraka was her son by the touch of Hari in Va1ra1ha form.

Once when Kr2s2n2a was sitting at leisure, Rukmin2i who was nearby fanned him. Kr2s2n2a indulged in fun and asked her how she chose a poor fellow like him leaving princes of equal status with her, and added that he was willing to let her go and marry a powerful Ks2atriya prince. This put out poor Ruk- min2i who wept bitterly, speaking words showing her unflinching loyalty to him. Noticing her sincerity Kr2s2n2a consoled her that he simply cut a joke. He said that she knew him to be Hari to whom Ra1jar2s2is like An3ga, Nahus2a and Gaya had dedicated their lives leaving their kingdoms, and that Brahma1 and S4iva sang his praises. Kr2s2n2a assured her of his loyalty to her. In this way he led a household life just like an ordinary mortal. Each one of his eight chief queens gave birth to ten sons, and each thought that Kr2s2n2a was only living with her, as there was a Kr2s2n2a by the side of each lady including the 16000 of Naraka's harem. He played with them blindman's buff, exchanging betels, scents, etc. The chief queens were Rukmini, Satyabha1ma1, Ja1mba- vati1, Satya1, Ka1lindi1, Ma1dri, Mitravinda1, and Bhadra1.

Heard a report of a huge lizard in a well, and lifting it up, he found it to be a divinity who revealed him- self as king Nr2ga and who went to heaven. Taught the citizens of Dva1raka on the invisilability of Bra1hman2as’ property. <F>32: Bha1. X. Chap. 64.</F> [Page1-446+ 37] Kr2s2n2a heard of Paun2d2raka's invasion of Dva1raka1 in his absence. Had a message from him either to give up the title of Va1sudeva or offer battle. Ugrasena and others laughed at this.

An {%a1bhica1ra%} Agni was sent by Paun2d2- raka's son through the grace of S4iva but was vanquished by Hari's {%cakra.%} By his {%yoga%} power Kr2s2n2a appeared at the mansions of each of his 16000 wives, engaged in a normal domestic life. When Na1rada entered every house, he saw the same Kr2s2n2a in each; got up early in the morning and meditated on Brahman; gave cows, etc., to the Bra1hman2as, saw first ghee, then mirror, cows, gods, etc. Heard from a messenger of the difficulties of kings imprisoned by Jara1- sandha. Advised by Uddhava to vanquish Jara1sandha with the aid of Bhi1ma at Yudhis2t2hira's {%Ra1jasu1ya.%} Kr2s2n2a's route to Ha1stina1pura where he was received by the Pa1n2d2avas. Draupadi1 welcomed his wives and, these were put up com- fortably. Hearing Jara1sandha still unconquered, Kr2s2n2a with Bhi1ma and Arjuna went to Girivraja in Bra1hman2as’ disguise and asked for meals. They then threw off their disguise and called him to battle in which Bhi1ma won. After releasing prisoners, Kr2s2n2a enthroned Sahadeva, son of Jara1sandha. <F>33:  Ib. X. Chaps. 67-73; M. 47, 14; Vi. V. 31. 4-28.</F> The kings thus released after the fall of Jara1sandha were 20800, praised the Lord and requested that they might ever remember Him. Kr2s2n2a asked them to go back to their places and assume charge of governments by ruling righteously. Sahadeva arranged their bath, dress and meals, after which they left for where Yudhis2t2hira and his family were.

Kr2s2n2a went as an ambassador of the Pa1n2d2avas to Dur- yodhana. He was sought to be made prisoner in vain; came back determined to declare war. In the war served as Arjuna's charioteer, and after the war Kr2s2n2a condoled with Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and after anointing Yudhis2t2hi1ra, returned to Dva1raka1. One day there came Kucaila, a Bra1hman2a classmate of Kr2s2n2a, a poor man with many children. Induced by his wife he visited Kr2s2n2a who welcomed him with Rukmin2i, indulged in talks of old school days, partook of the {%pr2thuka%} rice which Kucaila's wife had sent, and sent him away after keeping him for a night. <F>34: Bha1.

His joy at Vasudeva's sacrifice. Honoured Nanda. Praised by his father, Kr2s2n2a replied that A1tma is only one. At the request of Devaki1 to get back all her sons killed by Kamsa1, Kr2s2n2a entered Sutalam and with leave of Bali, took them to his mother who embraced them in affection. These children who were degraded gods gained their old form and went to heaven. <F>35: Ib. X.

Then he continued his righteous rule and spent a good time in Dva1raka1 enjoying pleasures with his chosen wives. <F>37: Ib. X. Chaps. 88-90.</F> His service to the world was to kill Daityas and relieve the burden of the Earth. Resolved to destroy the Yadu race and reach his eternal abode; approved of the curse of the sages against the Yadu race. Brahma1 and other gods visited him, appealing to him to go back to Vaikun2t2ha. He agreed. Uddhava expressed a wish to follow him but was advised by Kr2s2n2a to lead a righteous life. Incidentally Kr2s2n2a narrated to him the conversation of a certain Avadhu1ta and Yadu. Insisting on {%yama%} and {%niyama,%} and duties incumbent on {%varn2a%} and {%a1s4rama.%} Then he described who was said to be in bondage, who was a free man and a righteous person, and he also explained the need and importance of {%Satsanga.%} He proceeded to instruct Uddhava on the nature of the {%gun2as,%} and their causes, laying emphasis on {%satva gun2a.%} Then he explained {%Bhakti, Dhya1na, siddhis%} and their nature.

Gaya1sura with whom Vis2n2u was pleased was granted his request, to be the best of all; Yamapuri became vacant; all went to Brahma1 and he went to Vis2n2u; on the latter's advice Brahma1 went to Gaya1 and wanted to perform ya1ga on his body; a true devotee, Gaya agreed readily. But finding him un- stable Brahma1 ordered Dharma to place a stone on his head and the devas to stand to maintain balance; Vis2nu was again approached who gave his mu1rti and finding Gaya still un- stable Gada1dhara himself took his stand and made the stone motionless. Pleased, Vis2n2u gave him what he desired. It was that they should all live there and that the people who did rites there must reach Brahmaloka. See Gaya1 ti1rtham. Va1. 105. 5-13. ch. 106.

Jara1sandha understood them to be Ks2atriyas and still recalled Bali giv- ing the earth to Hari in a Brahmana's guise. So he offered to give his head. Then Kr2s2n2a and his two friends revealed themselves and invited him to battle. He refused to fight a [Page1-641+ 25] coward who left Mathura1 for a sea-girt-city, nor with un- equal Arjuna. But he agreed to fight with Bhi1ma. Then battle continued for 27 days and Bhi1ma felt despondent. Kr2s2n2a gave him a hint by tearing a twig behind.

On this Daks2a burst into anger against S4iva and insulted him saying he had eyes like a monkey, was a breaker of law and convention, lord of the Bhu1tas and Gan2as; he then cursed that S4iva should have no more share in sacri- fices and went away. Nandi got enraged at this and im- precated a curse on Daks2a that he would lose all knowledge of A1tman, and assuming the face of a sheep, would become dull-witted. Bhr2gu then pronounced a counter-curse that those propitiating S4iva shall become Pa1khan2d2as. <F>3:  Bha1. IV. 2 (whole). M. 13. 11-55, 60; 183. 22-3.</F> Appointed by Brahma1 as the overlord of all Praja1patis, Daks2a began the sacrifice of Br2haspatisava to which all gods went in groups. Sati1 also expressed her desire to go and requested permission of S4iva, who reminded her of the insult offered to him. <F>4:  Ib. IV. 3. (whole).</F> As she was persistent, she was allowed to attend. Going, she found that she was not properly welcomed by her father. The enraged Sati1 sat facing the northern direction in yoga and cast off her body by means of the fire of Sama1dhi1 to the distress of gods and others. On this the Gan2a followers of Sati1 attacked Daks2a, when Bhr2gu created a class of gods, R2bhus who vanquished these Gan2as. <F>5:  Ib. IV. 4 (whole).</F> Having heard of all this from Na1rada, S4iva grew angry; out of his anger sprang Vi1rabhadra who was ordered to ruin Daks2a's sacrifice. The beard of Bhr2gu was cut off, and Daks2a's head was severed from his body and thrown into the Daks2in2a1gni. <F>6:  Ib. IV. 5 (whole). Va1. 30 (whole).</F> The Gods waited upon Brahma1 who proceeded to Kaila1sa. He conciliat- ed S4iva and pleaded for the revival of Daks2a and continuation of his {%Yajn5a%} promising a share to him. <F>7:  Bha1. IV. 6 (whole).</F> S4iva agreed but [Page2-059+ 43] said that Daks2a should have the face of the sheep, Bhaga, Mitra's eye, and Bhr2gu the beard of a sheep. Agreeing to this Brahma1 went with S4iva to the sacrificial hall of Daks2a. Now Daks2a began to praise S4iva. When Vis2n2u's offering was poured to secure the continuation of the sacrifice, Vis2n2u presented himself in person when Daks2a, R2tviks, Sadasyas, Rudra and others present, spoke in his praise. Pleased at this, Hari remarked there was no difference among the Trimurti1s. Daks2a brought the {%yajn5a%} to a successful end. <F>8:  Ib. IV. 7 (whole); 29. 42.</F>
{%Daks2a%}	 son of Varks2i1 (Ma1ris2a1-{%Vi. P.%}) and Pracetas (Pra1- cetasas2-{%Vi. P.%}); a Praja1pati. He first created the Devas, Asuras, men and others inhabiting the sky, earth and water. Finding the creation incomplete, he went to the Vindhyas for {%tapas%} by bathing in the Agha- mars2an2a and propitiating Hari with the hymn of {%hamsaguhya.%} To him the Lord appeared and urged him to marry Asikni1, daughter of Pan5cajana and thus increase the created beings. <F>9:  Ib. VI. 4 (whole); Vi. I. 15. 10, 80-1.</F> Of Asikni1 he begot 10,000 sons called Haryas4vas. The latter proceeded to the western direction to the sacred lake Na1ra1yan2asaras at the estuary of the Indus. Purified by the bath and instructed by Na1rada on the bondage of Samsa1ra, these took to the path of ‘not returning’ {%(anvartana).%} Daks2a lamented and begot by the same wife a thousand sons, S4abala1s4vas. These again followed the path trodden by their elder brothers, advised by Na1rada. The enraged Daks2a cursed that Na1rada, the corrupter of youth, was ever to be a wanderer and to have no settled home. The sage submitted to it without retaliating. <F>10:  Bha1. VI. 5 (whole); Vi. I. 15. 82-104.</F> Con- soled by Brahma1, Daks2a further begot sixty daughters of Asikni1 (Vairini1-{%M. P.%}). He bestowed ten on Dharma, twelve on Kas4yapa, twenty-seven on Soma, two each for Bhu1ta, Angiras, and Kr2s4a1s4va, and the remaining five, of whom only four seem to be named (in v. 21) on Ta1rks2ya1. <F>11:  Bha1.

He however continued to live a life of celibacy, and detachment to things mundane, ever con- templating on Hari. He reached Brahma1 by entering the forest-fire in the course of his wanderings. Bha1.

A voice from the air said: “Rukmi tells an untruth”. Without heeding to this Rukmi insulted Ra1ma as a forester and herdsman and new to the art of dice. Ra1ma got enraged, took the mace and vanquished Rukmi: next he pulled out the teeth of Kalinga making fun of him all the time: others fled in fear; returned to Dva1raka1. <F>6:  Ib.

In the role of a young Brahmaca1rin, Hari appeared before Vr2ka and said that owing to curse of Daks2a his words would not come true. As a test he could try it on himself.
